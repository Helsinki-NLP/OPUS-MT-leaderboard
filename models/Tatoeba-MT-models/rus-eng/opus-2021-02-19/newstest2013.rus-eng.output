Republican strategy to resist Obama’s re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies in order to combat election fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, views the latter as a myth, arguing that fraud in elections in the United States is more rare than death by lightning.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions have partly discredited the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have since 2009 enacted laws that complicate the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon took on new dimensions after the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were passed in 2011 alone, restricting voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require the voter to present an identity card with a photograph and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register voters on the day of expression of will, and withdraw the right to vote from citizens with criminal records.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present an identity card with a photograph.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indian law.
The Republican authorities have rushed to extend the practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated legislation requiring voters to present photo identification cards in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
Indeed, 11 per cent of American citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached the voting age, do not have an identity card with a photograph issued by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
The cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25 per cent of African-Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo identification.
But that's not all.
Voters who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use a photo ID issued by their educational institution in several states.
At the same time, the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mainly for Republicans, to use the cards issued by these clubs for voting.
Until 2004, no state required proof of American citizenship to vote.
This was the first time that such a requirement had been introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are apparently aimed at limiting the vote of Latin Americans.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators initiated laws to abolish voter registration on polling day in eight states.
They have also limited the right of individuals or groups to assist those wishing to register.
This limitation did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to register some 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent decline in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, national legislators in five other states have enacted laws aimed at shortening the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted early were African Americans, although the latter represented only 13 per cent of the total number of voters in the state.
The same was true of Latin Americans.
Representing only 11 per cent of the electorate, they constituted 24 per cent of the citizens who voted early.
Unlike the whites, who made up 76% of the voters, only 46% of the voters were early voters.
Of course, Democrat legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws have been re-issued by Democratic Governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This has reduced the negative impact in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the submission of an identity card with a photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules that have come into effect will undoubtedly impede the exercise of the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics from Democrats condemn the bias of the laws that have been passed, as they clearly seek to influence the 2012 election results in key states.
The Brennan Center ' s 2011 report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 out of 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions have partly discredited the system of American democracy.
Screening for prostate cancer, do you want to take a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test produces sometimes wrong results, false and sometimes falsely positive results that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, who are so reluctant to undergo medical check-ups, have much more to doubt.
Do you want to pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
Studies in the United States have found numerous cases of infection among groups of subjects, so the data are difficult to interpret and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different mortality rates for those patients who have been screened and those who have not.
The study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastasis was 30-40% higher for those who did not pass the screening.
So I'd recommend a test from the age of 50, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and yarn-twisting.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer by offering him options, without mandatory prostate cancer treatment, which does not pose a risk to life in the long term, and by choosing, in these cases, to actively monitor the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
We'll offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we'll start treatment.
Increasingly, we define with precision the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I'd recommend you take the test.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to take the test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember has developed a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in scientific research, healthy lifestyles remain the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people were well fed and moved enough, 30% of cancer cases could have been prevented.
"If no one else had smoked, this figure would have risen to at least 50%," stresses André Bolé, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are due to hereditary causes.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking control remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85 per cent of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous damage to human health.
“Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” says spokesman André Bolé.
It is encouraging to note that 10 years after the cessation of smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon, colon, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Studies show that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer throughout life," they add to the Association.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too many quantities, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
sausages should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or saline can lead to carcinogenic substances.
"The latter may harm the cells of the body and lead to cancer," the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But to date, the results of these studies have not been conclusive.
According to SCC, vitamin E studies produce contradictory results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other had the opposite effect.
The assessment of the impact on vitamin D cancer is also unclear.
However, he stressed that it was important to discuss his concerns and family history with the doctor.
"The test doesn't lead to cancer."
Higgs' boson in detail.
Last summer, the report that scientists may have been able to locate Higgs' boson caused a real agitation - and not without cause.
It's believed that this boson explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, not a lot.
In addition, it is the last particle predicted in the Standard Model - our best, or in any case the “least imperfect” description of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not previously been detected in an experimental way.
But physics isn't quite sure it's the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we're dealing with a really new particle and that it's very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, the new data presented this week at a major physical convention in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data is not yet available for full confidence.
Let's just say we're talking about the Higgs boson, because the odds are minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law absolutely inevitable, saying that two things can't end up in the same place at the same time.
There's no way around this rule, don't try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself.
But although particle physics is a rather strange world, it also has one law of this nature: the principle of Paulie's exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same moment in time, if they are in the same “quantum state” is basically a state in some of its characteristics.
On this basis, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called farmers, who are prudently subject to the Paulie principle.
In another, bosons, an abominable gang of anarchists, who have no respect for anything — at least this principle — mean that they may find themselves in the same place at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratory's Particle Adventure, these bosons in turn are divided into two groups: Mesons, which we're not going to talk about here, and "particles of power", which spread the basic forces of nature and to which the Higgs boson is in some way related.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all exotic creatures as thought to be.
In fact, if you're able to read this chronicle, it's because of one incredibly banal boson: photon, or part of the light, which is an electromagnetic courier.
Indeed, when one particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it breaks the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown into a pond.
An electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.) is produced from this “violation”, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons of “power carriers”.
More stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with the only difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be violated in order for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to excite it, you have to achieve very, very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond whose surface could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator, like the one that's operating in CERN, the Large Adrone Collider, which is a 27-kilometre-diameter ring, to achieve such huge energy.
An electromagnetic field analogy is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with an electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on the fridge.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (like photon, by the way) do not.
So, what's "can bring" all this research, is Ms. Plamondon asking?
In science, they are used to test the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to sense a discrepancy between observations and predictions of the SM.
In addition, some of them yearn for such a discrepancy to emerge, so the slightest discrepancy can open the door to "new physics" and shut up some of the Model's holes.
The latter, to say the least, still has significant flaws, offering no explanation for gravity (oi!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oi-oi!).
But we haven't found any differences in CERN yet.
Impact
It is more difficult to predict the benefits of these studies for the daily life of the average person, but it would be a mistake to assume that they do not exist.
See, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell's labs couldn't even imagine what revolution their work would bring.
They anticipated their applications in science, but nothing more.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell's Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the previous ones were impulse) in 1962, said that the laser was originally considered more of a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
In addition, an application could be found for tools accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle, during his optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although not its original purpose, now serves as an eye for all digital cameras in the world and has won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die.
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate was about to resume, and a bill was being prepared.
Nevertheless, much remains to be done in this critical area.
Debt tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Montergie.
The prostate cancer that destroyed him from the inside gave him a two-year reprieve.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at Victor Gadbua's palliative care shelter in Beloya, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet on your own and even eating on your own.
Sitting at a table with a delicious meal on it, he gives up and agrees to be helped to eat.
He wakes up, even manages to smile, to talk to strangers who work around him, to bring him medicine, to take him to the bath.
Courage before a normal death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this disease.
"We've been taught throughout our lives that a man must pee standing up," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbois.
Regressing to the state of a child is an intolerable humiliation for some.
"Everything depends on a person's ability" to accept decline, he claims.
Since many people who care for palliative care feel that important events are occurring in the midst of this decline.
Patients who go to Victor Gadboa's palliative shelter are all cancer patients.
The prognosis gives them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses are no longer providing what is called “medical” assistance.
Mrs. A., aged 89, is most afraid to die “in the mind of suffocation”.
But the disease allowed me to recognize my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says, before I let her wear a mask to ease her breath.
She is still awaiting the last visit of her son from Italy in the coming days.
The Victor Gadbois Shelter provides body care and nutritional support with the help of a group of volunteers.
That's the palliative care that's left when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
Québec has one place in palliative care for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That's not enough, considering sooner or later we're all gonna die.
Life here goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at the shelter.
Whether it's physical, emotional, or emotional.
To the dying, we'll agree to provide mouthwash from brandy or Pepsi, as he asks.
Diabetics are no longer controlled by sugar.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died last night.
In the morning, his son drank that beer in his feet.
"We help our loved ones as well as our patients," says Natalie Sawar, director of nursing.
At Victor Gadbois Shelter, no day is like the previous day.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a young man of 36 is dying tragically, surrounded by parents, a wife and two young children, and having tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months, between three and five beds, always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christian Martel disquietingly.
Fifty-three per cent of the patients admitted to Victor Gadboa's shelter come from home and 47 per cent from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, to the care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have reached the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor Gadbois Shelter and the Palliative Care Society at the House of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this large gap in Québec ' s health system that causes many palliative care doctors to fear the enactment of a law that legalizes euthanasia and suicide assistance.
Beginning in October, a manifesto signed by the palliative care lights, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Québec’s health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the E.R., in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary steps to ease them.
I'm afraid patients only want to die because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists try to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
Helen Richard's hope of survival was already minimal when she stopped the exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was ending the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was ending the struggle, ” she tells me.
But she told me that my days were numbered!
There's no strong care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team eases their pain.
However, it must be noted that palliative care is not absolutely all-embracing in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, the director of palliative care in the Palliative Care Society at the House of Greater Montreal, patients are not susceptible to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of their lives, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, either occasionally or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't know about this suffering anymore.
More and more patients who fail to relieve pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want to get euthanasia," it means "I want to feel better."
This report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Health Research Institute of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road construction officials, construction contractors, political party fund-raisers and Italian mafia specialists daily tell what they know about the huge “system” that entangles the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias.
The industry, which cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"I'm curious how this system breaks down after all the funds have been put into action, "given by Jacques Duscheno, deputy and former chief of the Montreal police."
It was because of it that a scandal broke out in 2011 as a by-product of the investigation of official offences involving road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister of the time, Jean Share, agreed very reluctantly.
The Ducheno report established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and corruption.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he points out that the Department of Transportation alone would have kept a billion dollars on contracts," if some had held back their instincts to take a share.
The Charbonno Commission had already removed two mayors, and he added, in the hope that it would be able to “open schemes behind individuals”.
Standing Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011
The 2011 Standing Anti-Corruption Unit, which included a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts, joined the case.
In addition, Molott's special unit, which forced Montreal's “sink cartel” after 2009, to stop overestimating contracts.
In recent weeks, a series of searches had been carried out, and some municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotta, the mayor of a small town, had been charged with fraud and corruption.
It is next in line with Gilles Vayancourt, who recently resigned as Mayor of Lavalle, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received bribes when placing public orders.
In addition, several Montreal route engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accuro and Lino Zambito, were formally charged.
The latter detonated a real bomb, reporting an investigation into the "system" for obtaining government contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3 per cent of the value of contracts concluded in Montreal to some mafia broker, who in turn transferred money from Mayor Gerard Tramble's United Montreal party.
In the 2000s, Zambito spent more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) on various parties in the province, mostly the liberals then in power.
In addition, he confessed to illegally raising funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Sewage contracts with overvalued
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked without fail.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totalling $736,000 in exchange for sewage contracts, the value of which he overestimated.
Other officials responsible for road construction admitted that they had received 30 to 40 per cent of the bills by means of false supplements.
Then, an organizer from the mayor's party, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget, which filled the party's banks with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, plunged Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to cause alarm.
The mayor of Rivier de Prary County, east of the island, has been fighting the sale since 2010 of a municipal plot purchased for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million developers in the middle of a construction boom.
70% of the dirty money in campaigning.
She says that in the investigation that will eventually be launched, she “will pull a thread to understand the functioning of the system infested with ants to stop the gangrene and identify those responsible”.
This process is characterized as “suffering but positive”.
We're in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How we clean up at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Ducheno notes for his part that “the officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars”, but he is particularly concerned about the role of “elected officials who knew about the scheme” but who did not participate in the schemes.
Considering that the share of dirty money in funding the election campaign in Quebec is 70%, he jokes, "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Québec proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but according to him, this will not change the situation: “Until we strictly limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics.”
It requires a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and party financing: “We cannot fall below; by boldly grasping the essence of things, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy”.
If that story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duschenaux calls on those who laugh to look in their own backyard...
"AWL is not Barcelona's FC!"
This season, you've reached an extraordinary scale in the SSP.
How do you explain this height?
This may be explained by individual conscience, but it may also be due to a new dimension of the SSP.
The great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
Technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors force me to raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
It's happening very fast in football.
But I'm not falling apart.
From the beginning, at the NIF Pre-Training Center in Clerfontain, and before I arrived in St. Etienne, I always stepped forward.
So you're benefiting from the competition established by Carlo Anchelotti...
It's not a new summer to play very high-level matches.
They also know that every training is very important.
This results in a player like me wanting to be on the level and to be up to his best.
In addition, Carlo Anchelotti is supporting my position.
He's helped by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Anchelotti is the man of position?
Sure.
Anchelotti inspires respect for all technical staff.
Today, he has no equal in the First League and is among the best coaches in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience, and he's won a lot of high-end titles.
He worked with the great players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
That's when I walked away from a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my accomplishments.
What do you think of the first part of the season?
In the First League, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the League of Champions: we effectively qualified for one eighth of the finale.
What's the goal of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, in front of Portho, to be able to take the match back in one eighth of the finals.
Can the SSP become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate long-term positions.
That's not true today.
The SPF has the financial means to make this project real.
Not taking the title in the First League, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this championship.
We were close last season.
In May, it was a disappointment, because we had everything to get to the finish line first.
It's been a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
In general, 79 points suggest the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that strong teams like Marcel, Lyon and Bordeaux have joined the title struggle, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media expect too much from the SPF?
It's normal that we're expected to do a lot, considering how much money we've invested and what kind of players we have.
We're totally ready for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Troy at home and we're still found to be criticized for, of course, it's a little upsetting.
We wonder what people expect of us first.
We can never win a 4-0 every weekend.
We're not Barcelona's FC!
We're trying to implement the game project.
The team is formed over time.
We've proven in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who hasn't been able to make one eighth of the finals in two seasons, even though they've spent a lot of money!
Based on the sums invested, we represented you by 15 points ahead of us by the winter break.
That would be a disregard for our opponents and for France's championship.
Lyon and Marcel, who weren't at the top of the season last season, were awakened by this new SPM.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won as a result.
The SJP seems to be entirely dependent on the feats of Zlatan Ibrahimovich.
So what if they say there's some kind of "Zlatano Addiction."
This simply means that Ibrahimovich is very successful and that he scores many heads.
He's come for it, and he proves he's a First League star.
Wherever he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world-class star.
In the group, we respect him as a man and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was really exclusive.
It also encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive the Euro 2012 with France?
How disappointing.
I was eager to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from taking a little game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
Today I'm able to play a good selection match.
That's what I've been hoping for ever since I was baptized from the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and we must now be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Descham's head of the Blues?
They're good for him.
He has a good position in the selection team for the World Cup.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players, and he's an inspiration to win.
What Laurent Blanc was like.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us in the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved draw (1-1) torn out on 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before the shock in Spain, my career was never like this.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - Bitcoin
The exact opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties with fees for processing them.
Moreover, as often happens with these technologies, a political vision is evident: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, is both a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros ...) and a protected BitTorrent-type exchange protocol that allows file-sharing between participants at the same level.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers online.
Several thousand sites take bitcoins for donations or as a means of payment.
The rate of the Bitcoin, reaching a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to about ten dollars today (the rates are listed on Bitcoincharts.com).
It's nothing compared to the world's exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in the system in its virtual currency report published in October.
He describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "like ordinary currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credits” used to promote video games that are earned during the game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchanges are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are both account holders, auditors, issuers of currency, buyers and sellers.
How does the network function?
Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two e-mail addresses, like an e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction is electronically signed using a double key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that bitcoins used in the transaction do exist in a public ledger distributed throughout the network.
A key step is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
It goes through a mathematical task sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, has the privilege of adding this new line.
This is the hash phase of the file, that is, the conversion of a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hashing" all together.
The aim is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, other nodes can easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction is thus unbrokenly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user would want to pay twice the same amount of money in less than ten minutes, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solved the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the award is regularly shared in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred million, leaving a further reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing power.
The network has already experienced ups and downs.
Bitcoin service sites were attacked, and bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
“The defect used does not concern the protocol itself,” assured Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paymium, a company that pays with real money using Bitcoin.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog, allow it.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizman Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80 percent of the bitcoin were not in circulation.
The “Gigant sales” were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," cheers Yon Holmquist, who works at Coinabul, who converts bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or a non-contact payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is cheaper in this way.
The owner better controls his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough to give an address that can be "photo- and recognize" with a phone, as Pierre Nouza explains, assuring him that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time before Bitcoin settles, but 2013 may be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB’s report suggests, by the way, a re-examination of the various risks that are now considered to be heightened if the system succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapis and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
The time has come for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future without relying solely on us.
We suffered mainly from Afghan peasants, whom we viewed as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 dead soldiers and wounded and injured.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case under the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are tolerated, sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will be gone as soon as the West acts more delicately.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French loans, was proceeding well.
The convoy of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul since the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, the country was in flames and blood because of fighting between different factions.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for the darkness of these peasants, in which they have surpassed Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved today.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become dealers who take over State land to resell them for development to returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of huge United States subcontracts.
They're discredited; most of them didn't even fight themselves, by the way.
People, I hear in the countryside, want a government that isn't made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave as those who have succeeded in American generosity leave: capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they assessed its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in urban areas are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people, who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that look everywhere.
There's an army at the moment.
The authorities that would command her would they be considered legitimate?
Old anti-Soviet commanders are already taking steps to rebuild provincial friends who would not be subject to central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to a certain extent, following the Western pattern, but the United States wanted to make it a centralized State with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, has been dependent on foreign aid.
The industry was not on its feet, no dam was functioning, and no irrigation system was repaired.
All are imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruit.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Western countries were there only to take over.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without means of transportation to export through mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Ainak copper field, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers in the province.
It is also necessary that, one day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are heavily dependent, re-establish normal relations in an equal manner.
The withdrawal of French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a lycée for girls, for boys, a faculty of French at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to win hearts and minds and fulfil the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the “military-civilian activities” service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French social organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with intensive local labour, helped to contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased arable land.
What will we leave for ourselves by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would improve the living conditions of the local population, who are very harsh in these valleys, often above 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in Kapisa province.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups that farmers want, as they said, they need a little non-military support that is well controlled and that goes directly to them.
Hard labors of the Egyptian Constitution
This is President Mohammed Morsi's new risky move.
While Egypt is more than ever divided on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives it emergency powers, it has decided to play the wa-bank.
By surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the following day.
Exactly a week ago, the Head of State gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
It was soon two years, as Egypt had relied on a preliminary text that had been amended several times, which weakened institutional stability and led to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only increased the division of the country.
In the view of his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic delusions” by continuing “to violate the word” and “to violate the right”.
In the camp, his followers are convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to abandon their intention to explain the text, article after article, to the Egyptians.
It is also a way for the President to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages throughout the country.
Muhammad Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he stated in an interview to the American weekly Time.
Especially since the call for an accelerated vote is similar to the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: “Or do you vote for my text, or do I retain emergency powers”, which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals didn't respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to communicate their views.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to achieve the required quorum, 11 alternate participants were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
Not surprisingly, the articles were voted unanimously in most cases.
Commentators, by the way, have been amused by the fact that one of the few differences of the day has arisen around... the time for prayer, because some members of the committee felt that the Constituent Assembly hours were wrong.
The text, which was still under vote yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
General attention, article 2 ultimately remained identical to the article in the 1971 Constitution, which states that “Shari'a principles are the principal source of law”.
Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law was a basic requirement, had hoped to replace “principles” with “rules”, which would have made their application more stringent.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Physicians," says liberals, who see it only as PR.
Because, in their view, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with sharia law.
According to Egyptian expert Sophie Pomieux, this is alarming, i.e. “people who are called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can observe the birth of theocracy."
Many liberals are also moved by the fact that the next president of this university seems to be far less moderate than the current one.
“There is currently no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain in civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulema, but people with university education, some of whom have studied in the French system” calms Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that “there may be ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used in it are drawn from religious language.
This applies in particular to “fixes” [Islamic jurisprudence].
In the future, the question may arise as to whether civilian judges are competent to rule on this.”
In addition to its religious dimension, the text adopted yesterday has been criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers claim that they have been significantly reduced in comparison with those of the old regime.
Another controversial point is the power of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will not be considered in Parliament but in the National Defence Council.
The trial of civilians before military courts, despite requests from human rights associations, would also not be prohibited.
The latter had also expressed concern about the text, which they considered to be harmful to freedom.
Blasphemy was retained and insults were now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles speak of protecting a woman any more, highlighting Heba Moraef, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive development was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was supposed to be on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State, in turn, will be on the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Poop of the Earth and the sea from the rassol.
The Promised Land combines the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the primordial nature.
Aif identified five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Worship the Holy Places
It is worth visiting by the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that all those who enter this bathing house receive God's grace.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus ’ wonders: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking through the water, calming the storm, and filling the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But most of all the holy places in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here pass the Path of Sorrow or the path of Jesus Christ (in Latin, Via Dolorosa).
It begins at Antony’s fortress, Pretoria, where there was a trial, and in the streets of the Old City leads the tomb of the Lord on Mount Golgofa to the site of the crucifixion, the Stone of Anointment, and the burial place of Jesus.
Here lies the symbolic Christian Pupe of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
Jerusalem is also the most holy place for the Jews, the Wall of Crying, which remains from a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave briefs here with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Travel Vertically
The ruins of Massad’s fortress remained from the secret refuge of enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are located on high mountain cliffs at 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are interested in climbing can get to them.
The rest are being delivered to this historic peak by a lift on a cable road.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 metres, there is the famous Hermon ski resort, which during the winter months is a huge influx of tourists.
He's got a shuttle bus coming from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of skis is 45 km.
According to ancient tradition, pagan gods supposedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You don't get to go all the way in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's worth a visit to the Museum of Arts in Tel Aviv.
His exhibition features a large number of impressionists and expressionists, Moné, Pissarro, Renoire, Cezanne, Ciselais, Matissa, Modigliani, Chagaal and Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al Basha Ban Museum, which is a series of old Turkish bath halls with mock visitors and banners at the time.
In Ceysaria, you should go to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dalí and Rodin.
There are no tour guides or gift shops.
The entrance is free of charge, and donations are categorically rejected.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the children's memorial, is built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it, you end up in total darkness.
The stars are fading.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are being used.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Get well.
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has pools, water parks, dolphins and oceans.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea, even during the winter months, water temperatures do not fall below 21 degrees Fahrenheit and the air warms up to 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C].
The dead sea is even warmer, and it swims all year round.
By the way, this is the most extraordinary sea in the world at the lowest point on the planet, 417 metres below sea level.
The azure water in it is a slurry that can easily keep afloat without even being able to swim at all.
The landscapes around here are really beautiful.
They come here to receive treatment with salt water — rapas, and healing mud — and to treat dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus — to help clean up the shattered nerves.
Touch the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are stored in the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffo on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
He passed through the famous Maritime Route linking Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to the tradition, this is where Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander the narrow streets named after the Zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your own sign, Fortune will be favorably favored.
In Jaffa, you can see newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even from other countries at a photo shoot.
And in Ceysaria, the city of King Herod, you can wander through the Roman theater, take the fortress of the Crusaders.
In the Roman period, Ceysaria was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
A carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
A tourist for a note.
When you go to Israel, don’t worry about your imperfect English: about 30 percent of the population knows Russian.
It is not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (currently $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mostly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and Haifa has the country’s only subway line, consisting of six stations, linking the Lower City to Upper City.
It's basically an underground car.
All modes of urban transport cost 6 shekels, which can be followed by a 1.5-hour journey.
In Israel, the Sabbath is celebrated by Jewish tradition on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport are shut down.
And Sunday morning begins the week of work.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher foods, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes that mix milk with meat.
It offers a large variety of ovine and beef dishes, soups, and desserts made on coconut milk, traditional Jewish paste hummus, a variety of sauces, hammered nudity balls - phalalels, fruits, and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of fed cats that go "walking on their own."
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Murly women love public places and don't refuse treats.
The rental of the car, depending on the brand, will cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus the insurance is $15 a day.
It'll cost 15 shekels a day to rent a bike.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
numeric language
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
The greatest number of visitors to travel and rest came from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine.
The Promised Land was visited by 118,800 Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, an increase of 51 per cent from 2010, until the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
The Great and Powerful One will lead to Moscow: Migrants save money in their language
While deputies and human rights defenders are arguing what the law on compulsory language testing will do, there are already fraudsters in the country selling “lip” certificates.
Each year, 13 million gastarbiters arrive in Moscow, Petersburg and other Russian cities.
For the most part, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to support the families left behind.
On 1 December, a law entered into force requiring every migrant worker to take an examination in the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service, utilities, welfare and retail trade sectors.
However, over time, the FMS promises that tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
Not only language, but also Russian history, and the basis of legislation, will have to be surrendered.
Language proficiency will have to be confirmed both to obtain and to renew the work permit.
The exception applies only to nationals of countries where Russian is the State language.
Nor are people who had completed their diplomas and diplomas before the break-up of the USSR in 1991 subject to the law.
Benefits, doomedness and protection of rights
The network of examination points will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the MGU, the PUBGU and other Russian universities.
Migrants would be able to take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres had already opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by both the State Duma and the FMS.
Before the law came into force, human rights defenders had asked the press many times: what would that actually do?
What will change the binding knowledge of the language for both Russians and visitors?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service replied, which would reduce the number of people suffering from “labour slavery”.
Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, as explained by Victor Sebelev, head of the FMS Mission in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment would solve 90 per cent of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession or education who do not know a language and do not have a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, I'm sure the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of helping him, will stick him in a frightfully tight shack, where he and dozens of his kind will languish for months without food and documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
“In the country they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, their passports are taken away, and they do not pay the promised salary,” confirms the head of the Labour Migration Directorate of the Ministry of Labour of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't swear, you bastard!
However, as long as many citizens of the Central Asian republics are going to work for Russia, it is recognized that not only do they not know the language of the country to which they aspire, but they also have difficulty writing in their own language.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even a good primary education.
Their families have nothing to feed their children, let alone dress them properly, put their shoes on, and put them in school.
As a teenager, these guys go to work as soon as possible.
It's hard, if you don't know your language, they'll admit it.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Indeed, with regard to the language law, human rights defenders note one important point.
The tests will be conducted only for those migrants who are in legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the gastarbiters still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or the outsider's not allowed."
Many visitors claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs between 12,000 and 16,000 rubles.
But a false registration can be made quickly and for just 1,500.
The Russian police know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence the extortion cases.
"A hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists a citizen of Tajikistan, Umed Khushkadamov.
"Go on, don't be stingy, buy the painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that not only migrant registration documents were false.
Several "lip" language test certificates have already been withdrawn by FMS staff.
The fake papers are printed on a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get them for free: each of the migrants hoping to make it easier for themselves to pass the tests paid seven thousand roubles for the document.
This is more than twice as expensive as a formal test procedure: it would cost a 3,000-year-old worker.
The main challenge in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the “nuts” cannot simply be bought, and the authorities and human rights defenders alike agree.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise to undertake basic language courses for gastarbaiters who have not been successfully tested at the first time.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered jobs in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not trade illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low.
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to tighten the law on the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: the shooting at weddings without casualties and the massacre by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
Police officers want to ban the wearing of trauma in public places and raise the age at which to obtain a gun licence from the age of 18 to the age of 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, and promised that the arms law would be amended in the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by “turning the nuts”.
An open letter has appeared on the network, and the authors of which - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demand that “unnecessary tightening” be abandoned.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, as stated by the Russian BBC forensic lawyer Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the six months of 2012, 142 offences involving firearms registered with the internal affairs agencies were committed, while in the same period there were 1,168,000 recorded offences.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of civil weapons legislation does not place the offender in the black market.
Now, they say, you can find any weapon in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs is alleged to be monitoring the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Vendors: from factories to officers
The black arms market is being expanded through several channels.
The main five channels are described by retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who served 10 years in the Ministry of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot of the website receiving weapons orders
The first is an army or military trail, which is a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The Russian officers and the Caucasians carried the weapons," says the Baran.
The next type of "black weapon" is stolen by criminals from the security forces.
The baran explains that this includes both stolen from police warehouses and stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
Illegal "barrels" are being sold from military warehouses.
There have been frequent explosions in many military warehouses.
"There are proven accounts that some of the arsons were made deliberately to cover up the shortage," says the former military.
According to the Barantz, arms manufacturers are doing their part.
“There are now private weapons factories that are not competitive in the international market and are throwing weapons from under the floor into the black market, including Moscow”, the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
There are particularly large numbers of pistols and assault rifles coming from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a production, sometimes handicraft, and there is a mob that has organized the flow,” the former military explains.
Where'd the guns come from?
The experts considered the approximate share of each source of illicit arms shipments to the black market.
A report on this was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design in 2011.
Experts analysed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data from portals on weapons issues.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, written by researchers, come from the army and security agencies.
Half of the weapons on the black market were “in the hands of officials whose work is related to weapons” as stated in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places of armed conflict, 14 per cent are stolen during the weapons production phase, and 5 per cent are from “black archaeology”.
The seller-consultant of one of the gun stores, who asked not to give his name, assures me that the weapons found by the black diggers have not been bought in a long time.
Most of the time, he says, the sellers follow the new shipment to the military warehouse.
A man buys a unit through a master, like a TT gun.
He's being discharged, handed over through the fence.
"He transports it to the city and here sells 900 euros apiece for two stores," he says.
“True, the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically, when a crime-disclosure plan is set on fire, they conduct a controlled purchase from illegal arms dealers”, adds the consultant.
"As in a luxury store."
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the websites, on the blog, until a friend responded, who offered to come to the Begow platform, where there would be a man who would take me to the corner, where we would bargain.
The price of the gun was only there.
Military columnist Victor Baranets
To get a gun, I need a friend who has a way out, says the consultant salesman.
There are salesmen in the markets, but you have to come, conditionally, from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell you that his daughter had a tooth.
I'm even getting a couple of casts right now through the person I'm sure of.
He only gives them to me, too, because he knows I'm not gonna turn him in.
Newcomers are looking for guns in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing an article on it for publication.
The pattern, he said, hasn't changed.
They gave him an album with pictures of "anything."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranz, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I'm not just buying. We're going to the woods with the salesman, putting a target.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm satisfied that the weapon is good, we start to bargain," the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the couch.
Internet searchers are posting sites and groups at Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
It doesn't take any documents or face-to-face meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they put it in an ad hat on "Buy a gun or a gun."
Users leave their applications and ask questions.
And the minors will be sold?
"Unlicensed of course," asks the user Ivan (orthography saved).
"The Buying of TT. Moscow" is a concise request from the Fedorenkos.
The Federal Security Service is now dispersing a huge network of front sites that want to buy combat weapons with a shovel.
People walk like hungry fish to feed and then they get coal in Siberia.
Military observer and former military officer Victor Baranets
I've heard of such schemes: the site is usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer pays through the ATM.
“In response, a photograph and instruction are sent to hide the weapon,” says Dmitry Kislov, the spokesperson for the Right to Arms.
Victor Baranets claims that by leaving the application on the website, you can be unarmed and go to jail.

$100 Makarov.
In the purchase of illegal firearms, experts estimate that between $100 and $900 can be met.
According to Dmitri Kislov of The Right to Arms, Makarov's gun can be purchased for $100 to $300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from the long-term storage facilities by the management of these mid-level warehouses.
According to official statistics, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7 per cent from January to October 2011, to 22.9 thousand, and the number of reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Fast food and supermarket workers are on strike in the United States.
Working at McDonald's, it runs to a quarter of all U.S. teenagers.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests across America against low salaries in Walmart Corporation department stores and restaurants of popular fast food networks such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendis and Kentukki Fride Chien.
As long as no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth shaft or be expected to exhale at an early stage.
The activities are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries paid to Walmart and fast-food workers, the protestors aim to establish trade union organizations.
This sector of the economy has so far been largely excluded from the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The stock started last week, after Thanksgiving, on what's called Black Friday, when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sales that took millions of residents and sometimes involved a fight.
On that day, some of Walmart’s employees, who employ 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and picketed the company’s stores, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, whose goods were counted on people of modest and medium means.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in his stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of Walmart’s low-paid workers only cook at their jobs.
The availability and range of products made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell cheap goods partly because he pays little to his employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of vehicle loaders or manual scanners.
Shareholders on Black Friday demanded an increase in their salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart employee who gets $9.5 per hour, they say, it's out of pocket.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost a corporation $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she's spending on her salary now.
If Walmart puts the whole salary increase on the buyer's shoulders, every visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
They're going to spend $12.39 more in a year than they are now.
Walmart’s supporters quite say that the protests occurred in only nine states and did not cause any damage to the corporation.
Black Friday continued at her stores from 8 p.m. Thursday to midnight the next day, during which time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cashiers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
In an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post, corporate spokesman Dan Vogelman claimed that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was just a “other pyaristic stunt” of the union that organized her.
"Free cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by Walmart department stores (they are not complained of in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), but by McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
MacDonalds says he sells billions, and after that, he doesn't even give you sick and pay you for an honest job!
Jumaine Williams, member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Restaurants increase their diet over time, but not much, and on average their employees receive $8.90 per hour in New York City.
No one earns less in this dear city.
How can you exist in New York with that kind of money? It's impossible for me.
Back in the day, the McDonalds went through almost a quarter of American teenagers who were working for their counters after school, living with their parents.
Few have seen this as their main source of food or have planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I'm constantly running into an interview with McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed on it.
On the other hand, there's a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum that says it's irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're gonna feed them.
The protesters, who started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, more than doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the area of fast food.
American law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing trade unionists with scorn and dismissal.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their lives.
But it's hard to get fast food to the union for objective reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
Dissenting
A number of other low-cost restaurants in Manhattan also had noisy protests on that day.
The event culminated in a mid-day rally at McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democrat politicians, in particular City Councilman Jumaine Williams, spoke, saying, "McDonalds says he sells billions of drinks, and then he doesn't even give you sick and pay you for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as the candidate for mayor of the city, Bill De Blacio, who stated that “we must join hands in support of fast food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.”
As the New York Times described, it was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated, and not all of them were fast-food workers, who employed tens of thousands of people in New York City.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will generate the flames of mass movement.
"As long as you lie to the brain, it's average."
A popular theme among the fans of modern technology has been the recent addition of reality, mainly through the prism of special points.
Initially, at its annual conference in the summer, Google showed the current model, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, talking to the team leader of the interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge Microsoft Laboratory, Sharam Isadi, shows that for the scientists of the company, the glasses are the past stage.
They are attracted to the prospect of virtual objects being manipulated in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Can you give me an outline of what your research team is doing?
- We do human interaction with machines, but we try to spread the boundaries of that interaction.
As long as mankind is stuck in the mass at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes with a finger in them.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and anticipate fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect, because everyone is interested in sign control.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Even though Kinect has moved the interaction to the physical level, much still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has improved (the system receives more data) and the output is not yet very good.
We're trying to change that, we're working on really three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
To do so, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, screw those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It's popular, but isn't it overrated?
- It's definitely not a panacea - it's a question of privacy, because you don't always want to let people know what you're doing and what you're doing.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone's in their niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about wavelengths, but about such cheap, short ones.
The gestures were not taken by a camera, but by a hand bracelet that captured the movement of the bones and muscles.
So far, it's big, but in theory, it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is a mixed type of control, like a gesture plus a voice.
- How's that?
- Like, how do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You'll say it and you'll show it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that's gonna be really hard to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what a machine can or can't do at the moment?
- It's not necessary, but it's a rapprochement.
I think in the near future we're going to have to basically work on developing new types of sensors that will make it possible to measure human reactions more accurately.
It could be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it's very important.
- Speaking of your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what's your problem with modern cameras?
Lack of permission, depth, or anything?
- In principle, the current generation is something to build on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at 1,000 k/s.
But it's not about the megapixels themselves, it's about the matrix and the depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, which adds work to the algorithm designers.
So you have to remember not only the X and Y authorization, but also Z.
Also very important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and today's 30 k/s is not quite enough, especially for signs.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond lab made a touch sensor with controlled processing delays ranging from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I could really use the equivalent of this device in my job, but it doesn't require touching, so there's more footage per second.
- Don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
There are now three cameras in Kinect, one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the other is a reflector receiver.
Now, the third camera is actually the normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of an object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the amount of calculations required.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the curve of the cameras, and see how this helps in the three-dimensional position determination.
As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present her glasses to the public.
Don't you think that in terms of the day-to-day use of the technology of the augmented reality of glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, keeping a smartphone in your hands is not very convenient all the time, but I think the coolest option would be a transmutable, augmented reality, where, on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display, and go on everywhere.
The glasses are a very personal device, in which their power (private things only you see) and at the same time weakness - the added reality of the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Let's imagine for a minute that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to a simple mortal.
There is one problem that is often pointed out by critics of such an idea: no tactful recitation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers are your team preparing for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be an addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is using the second hand as an image substrate.
She's a great recorder of the presses!
But there are technologies that are actually designed to give these "cartoons in the air" a sense of touch -- for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is located -- gives a sense, but so far it's very weak -- it's like you've been blown to your pillows.
There are bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in the fingers -- also a promising direction.
- Were you trying to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he's supposed to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
There is yet another challenge that remains to be overcome for a long time -- how to make a person physically in a very limited space believe that he is walking on an open, virtually endless path -- work on the concepts of tread tracks (other than clubs), moving platforms, and huge balls.
As long as it's medium-sized to cheat the brain, it's a long-term job.
That's what makes work on the virtual reality so attractive to the researcher -- many things in an entirely embryonic state.
Flavour instead of culture - Rosbalt.
Rosbalt continues the "Petersburg avant-garde" project dedicated to the forward citizens in the avant-garde of culture and art.
The top list already includes prominent artists from the art scene of Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe without all Russian publicity.
The new character "Rosbalta" is the epic artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red, who meets at the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, and the fashion parties and the returns.
Cyril Miller's paintings always gather crowds of viewers wherever they go.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely Petersburg socio-philosophic storytellers who create new mythology.
Cyril Miller is the brightest man in the Petersburg avant-garde of the late '80s and early '90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city who, by appearing on the streets, smiles at the citizens and lifts the moods of all.
Recently, he took possession of a charm and became a peterburg charmer, as he was ripe for this difficult role by all his bohemian existence, philosophy, and image.
- Kirill, why are you walking around the city in all red, not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a fashion designer.
In this world, red is a trade-off between artist, imagemaker and society.
Although everything in society that's a little bit gray causes aggression and bad behavior.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative acts is an invitation to a discussion.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in DC Nevsky, where my work was displayed.
I knew it was my way.
Then a wave of old, free, unofficial artists passed, and the new, free kind of me was incomprehensible.
I began to be friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gas-inflation that led to Pushkinskaya 10, and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into the theater, clothes, music, all but the word.
It was important for me to be at the center of Petersburg's culture, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I took over territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and there was a music and art club there, a bohemian club, a peterburg Bohemian home.
A lot of people were born there, but we, Tequila Jazz, remember Schnour bringing in the Van Gogh Project.
Schnour and his friends sang light songs under plywood, they were in tight tights, among them was the fashionable current composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band got live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs until the Hali-Ghali era.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went away, and he got basic education and education from us.
The D 137 Gallery, the Gryboed Club, are echoes from the Art Clinic.
That's where our workers and regulars went.
I'm a hero of yesterday's century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was "The People of Our City".
"The Artist of the Year" nominated me, ended my climax.
In new times, it's hard to work under the old rules, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
It's easy to become popular in these years, but culture and popularity are shared, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a recognizable manner.
- A lot of my paintings are hits, they're very relevant and acute.
I'm gonna have a show show, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are an out-of-time category.
I used to be social, now being like this is painful and scary.
But in clowns, everything gets blurred, tragedy is taken off.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through totalitarian dressing in order of order.
They're now meeting with an outside mechanic, not an inside man.
Maybe you can't give him a hand and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by dressing.
And recently, we saw you as a city charmer.
Who I don't want to be?
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful.
- Now, commercial art must be neat, tactful, sweet.
There's been a breakdown of cultures.
People used to get into packs, a goddess loved one thing, just another.
Now everyone's broken into microcommunities, and now it's hard for everyone to like.
I'm not a $100 piece of paper for everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand at Stas Mikhaylov!
- He gets dumped, he's got a sex-social sphere.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't come, and in the end, less management, less money, everything will go away.
I've got fans, and the most important thing is not to fool them, not to ruin what I've learned.
When I was a kid, I wrote these paintings that a collector had them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov hanging.
I started with paintings that usually end.
It's often a misunderstanding now.
They say culture is spiritual, culture of consumption.
There's no culture of consumption, it's from another opera.
I'm a man of yesterday's culture, growing up with examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, gave up money to paint paintings.
I'm for this kind of culture.
- Kirill, what's missing for Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a thing as a cultural official.
But not every one of them can practice culture.
Under the right kings, things were wrong, the kings may not have understood much in culture, but they realized that they needed to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow right now.
We have people in Petersburg who might be experts, but they're advanced, because we need higher-level experts who will appreciate these experts and give them a way.
There's a good taste in it right now.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there's a lot more culture in Moscow, there's soil there.
And on our rocks, the art is hard to grow.
We need cultural soil, and now we have more writers than readers, it's wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We've got this layer of thin air.
We need to fashion art, as we did at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented with funding from St. Petersburg grant
To be born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spaceships with Earthlings on board are going to search for an alternate planet.
In order to preserve mankind, the main question arises as to how to continue their family in a weightless environment or on the same reserve planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Surdin, senior researcher at the P.C. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAISH).
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then the surface of Venus is at 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in Venus's orbit... in space.
To approach reproduction issues in space began with flora.
Half a century ago, we did experiments on plants.
Four generations of in-orbit peas were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then it's the orbiting of insects, tiny fruit flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to check on the development of the embryo under conditions of weightlessness.
We're getting a perfectly normal chick on the way out.
Here comes the problem.
“The problem is that this chick has to find a support, it must stand on its feet and begin to move”, explains the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of RA Vladimir Sychev.
When the chicks did not find the support, they would run around in a random manner.
And 10 hours later, newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
Birds didn't react to light or sound.
And the trouble there was that four days later, they were just dead.
"And twice we hatched the chicks, and then we refused, because it's just impossible to work with them," notes the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space, Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last biological "miniccheg" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only the same-sex species will be on the Bion biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with a fetus.
In principle, nothing supernatural was discovered there.
"It was on biosatellites, but again, it's a single experiment, and it needs to be done," notes Vladimir Sychov.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
But it is not yet possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their natural habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Humans, unlike animals, can, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkova had the biggest risk.
And the most precious thing mankind has is a female organism.
Our Seagull's gone, and no one on Earth could have said if it would survive a space flight.
Will she be able to have a baby after this flight?
"No one answered that question," says Vakhtang Wachnadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the space flight, Valentina Tereshkov's first female cosmonaut gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child, Andriaan Nikolaev, was also an astronaut.
In 1988, Svetlana Savitska, the second cosmonaut, had a son in orbit twice and even worked in outer space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have many cosmonauts who, after long flights, have had enough, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it's dangerous even in orbit flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia Valery Polakov.
Yet, mankind needs to find new ways to biotechnologies, to protect against radiation, to create artificial gravity.
The CDC Hydrolab is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in a situation of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts work out their skills in outer space.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If the water is comfortable for adults, but it's a strange environment, it's natural for babies.
The little ichthyandres seem to confirm that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There's a connection between having a baby in her fertilized fluid for about nine months, which makes it easier for him to get used to the water.
In principle, that makes sense, because it's only two weeks since birth, from that first bathing.
"That's very little to forget," says the breast-navigation instructor Marina Aksenov.
In other words, if the weightlessness of the child is more natural for the child to be born, then gravity, gravity, is necessary for the woman.
Very quickly in weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, the pelvis, and the ability to squeeze the fetus declines.
All right, let's put that down, too, relying on birth stimulants.
Of course, we can go to labor in a special cell, she'll push him out.
"What's next?" asks the nontrivial questions Valery Polakov.
On the other hand, a child also needs artificial gravity.
Without a sense of Earth’s gravity, the body will not form a skeleton or a muscular system.
It's impossible to put a newborn in orbit like an adult in a special load suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment, which you and I are going to do by allowing a child to be born in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled person to Earth, a completely disadapted man," the head of the IMBP Bioethics Committee of Igor Pestov foresees.
As long as the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, in time, it will be a reality when the Earthers on their ships go to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of the General Auditing and Auditing Department: The audit of the Schwarz system failed because of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic had good control bodies and, despite the existence of quality legislation, was lagging behind in its implementation.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for Aktuáln.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack," commented Kala's current situation.
Such findings are provided by a joint inspection of the Czech and German monitoring bodies.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter One Hour’s approach to the so-called Schwartz system is cited.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the PJP (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is this prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the institutions that are required to verify and enforce obligations”, Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the public procurement legislation of both countries was compared.
What exactly were we talking about?
It means a parallel test that we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation affirms how public procurement should take place, national legislation follows and then also applies in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even with the verification still pending, interesting differences have emerged - in simple terms, we may have “precise and unmistakable” legislation, but in practice we are somewhat inferior to Germany in some respects.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but rather to focus on the application of the law itself.
How does this project really help you, what does it mean to you?
It is such joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because it does not produce a positive result.
Economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not a fact that we're going to achieve this by reducing our orders.
Perhaps the system will be filled with “papers” so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not decreased.
You are referring to internal problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the German control system work?
Is there an organization like our CRU or does it work differently?
As far as institutions are concerned, our CRU is Bundesrechnungshof, which is based on our principle, there is also a collegiate body that works in a slightly different way, but both institutions basically operate in a similar way.
Moreover, the powers are to some extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the level of the federal Länder - their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are monitored at the level of the Federal Accounts Chambers.
As far as local legislation is concerned, is it easier than we are?
In fact, I don't want to compare without specific data, but in some ways, Germany is a model, but it's not certain that it's better at everything.
Is that because they're better at control?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it must be said that even model countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't benefit from working with our office, would they?
With regard to domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affect your establishment, do the consequences appear in some way?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet been demonstrated in our monitoring work.
As we monitor the facts, some delay must be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future audits -- we started using our new tool of "discovering the risk of non-economy," through which we ran almost 14,000 government contracts, and we analyzed them, and of course, these changes will manifest themselves because the restrictions are changing, the terms of some types of tenders, and so on.
Do you believe that the approval of this law will bring benefits or additional burdens to the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that might arise was that the rules would be “stretched” and could not be respected.
In previous regulations, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g., regional operational programmes to the regional council) in that any failure to comply with the public procurement law constitutes a violation of budgetary discipline.
In that case, should the law be tightened in that way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal error that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only put even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the FOC would not bother entrepreneurs by checking the so-called Schwartz system.
Is the Schwartz system prohibited or permitted?
The law should be established in some way and, if it prohibited anything, the Prime Minister could not oppose the work of the bodies that were required to verify and enforce obligations.
You can say, "We're gonna change this law and let it go," but you can't say we're gonna pretend like nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains rather strict rules, as and what should be formally implemented, and this is correct, which will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it's tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal flaws.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
They're mostly passing through, but somewhere with greater caution.
Carlovarsk region
This morning, in the Carlovar region, roads were crossing, but somewhere frozen and snowed.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but it should warm up a little bit during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, with only a small layer in the lowlands.
However, there are about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Ferrous Mountains.
According to information received from regional road workers, the places were less visible due to fog.
The R6 expressway and first-class roads in the region are currently not restricted.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be frozen and slippery.
Also, all the roads in the second and third classes, including the mountain tracks, are covered.
But some of them still have leftovers of frozen snow and snow.
You should be especially attentive to the roads on the high places.
Pardubitsky and Kralovegradsk region
The Czech Highway and Highway Authority reports on its Internet pages that some eastern Czech roads are threatened by holodecks, and mountain roads and roads on highlands may have a flooded layer of snow.
District road workers warn drivers of a holodeck, which can be formed especially on the highlands of Pardubic.
The holodeck may be near Lanschkron, Usti nad Orlitzi, Policki, Sweetavi or Visoke Mito, especially on Class II and Class III roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located in Sweetawi, are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkonoše and the Orlicki Mountains.
The snow is found on roads on highlands in the areas of Richnova nad Knegnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia today, there is a variable cloud without precipitation.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Plesen edge
The roads in the Plzena province are passing this morning, but the places have to be careful and adapt to the weather.
It's freezing in the morning, temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, it may be slippery in some places.
Local drivers may encounter fog, but the visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
Road D5 now runs almost without restrictions, but road managers recommend that care be taken between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a dry and extinct surface.
In southern Plzny and Takhova, there may be cold spots.
Class II and class III roads are wet, and there is also a warning against the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the low-use roads in the Shumava area.
Olomoutsky edge
Drivers heading to the highlands of Olomouz should now consider the snow mush on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Cervenogorian saddle and on the road to Videl Krsij.
During the night, snow caused traffic workers to enter the street, according to traffic records, about three centimeters of snow fell in Schumperka.
In other parts of the province, roads are generally not restricted.
"On the highlands of Schumper lies the remnants of snow.
Drivers heading towards Jesenik must bear in mind the presence of snow porridge in the Czerwenogorian saddle,” CHAN (Czech News Agency) today told the traffic controller of the Sumperk Road Administration.
During the night, their colleagues from Jesenica went to clear the roads, and they assured them that the roads on the highlands had remained naked and wet after being treated with chemicals.
In Olomouz, roads are not restricted, but in Sternberg, drivers must be alert to forest areas where humidity is still present.
Ustecki Krai, Liberecsky Krai
This morning, traffic workers from northern Bohemia report that there are some difficult passages left.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snow, a mountain road from Telnica to the Clinic in the Ostec region has been closed.
The temperature also remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads, and in the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Middle Mountain, on the contrary, there is no problem, the roads are mostly dry.
No traffic complications have yet been reported.
Road traffic workers report the occurrence of a holodeck in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, the conditions for its formation at night were perfect - all day raining and melting snow, night sky clearing and freezing.
Disadvantages were reported on the main highway and on I/13 on the border between Ustecki and Liberetsk province.
The branches of trees around the road, which were bent under the snow, forced them to close the road to Tellice on Knitz.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts, we want to accumulate positive energy.
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we humans are so easily caught up in.
Together with The Tap Tap, we're constantly making jokes on this subject and saying that we're the only group in the world that can generate enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In fact, in December, you're going to give three completely unique concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell the readers more about this?
This is a national fund-raising exercise that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, which was announced to end on 21 December at 11:10.
The day before this event, December 20th, at 9 p.m., three parallel concerts will begin in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, to put it bluntly, as the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, whose time zone is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was my idea, and then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to generate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to reflect with the public on the state in which this world will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought at www.e-tap.cz and thus support us.
The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world called "The end of the world is cancelled".
Will an anthem already loved by YouTube listeners sound at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if it all works out and the world doesn't end.
He'll be singing at all the concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also be broadcast live on Czech television at the same time.
The lyrics to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the video "Tomashank", also participating in the performance of Xindl X...
How did you start cooperating with them?
We also cooperate with other individuals in Czech cultural life, as we have many charitable events and concerts.
We are trying to actively involve them in these projects.
Turns out a lot of people like working with us, they're interested.
What's the profit from the concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for a barrier-free education centre, STUDEO, we've been doing this for the sixth year with a civil association called Tap at the Edlichka Institute.
Teachers regularly visit students of the Edlichki Institute and have fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we are trying in this way to give them this opportunity.
As part of the Supplementary Construction Project of the Edlichki Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with the project.
Each concert will feature several music groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to design a programme that will interest all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, there will be Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustrosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiri Suhi.
Details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any similar “Gradia events” in the future?
We'll be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival in May, and we'll certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would love to have a performance at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we're in the United States, would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
You've got big plans for overseas, you've already been to Madrid, Brussels, London, and Moscow.
The Tap Tap group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks.
We've got five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs have to travel in the luggage room, plus a lot of cargo and toolboxes.
However, for the time being, the Czech airlines ČSA and British airlines British Airways have always been perfectly prepared for us, which has surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, where we came from recently, everything went smoothly.
By travelling abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards persons with disabilities, and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do, we have seen in Russia that the east is still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are many barriers, and there is still a wild movement of a person in an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
It's also not like there's such banal things as giving way to a handicapped person in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already social organizations that try to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, should we always catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's normal for people with severe disabilities to travel on their own on the streets, to go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
It's not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in public life, which is where the Tap Tap and I are slightly ahead of them!
Respect for the public or non-barrierism is one thing, but the moment we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything will really change.
So far, these are isolated cases - people with strong will.
The Tap Tap band is now very popular, but back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Edlichki Institute as an educator, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself and I play a saxophone, I've organized an interesting music club with a colleague.
Well, over time, as our host Ladja Angelovich says, it's gotten a little out of hand.
Popularity has only come in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It's true, we were helped by the fact that we started joining famous singers and actively working on the promotion of the band.
We have come to the conclusion that work that no one can appreciate is, in fact, as if there were no such thing.
With European Union funds, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was the goal for you to develop the Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
Show business is full of things imitating one another.
It's logical, all new things are taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us is, of course, pity, it's natural...
But this pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned individuals we have to pity.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's a shift not just for them, but for society as a whole.
Was it successful that you were a strict leader, as many people think you are?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising and disciplined in many things.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us romantically and fly in the clouds, and when they find out they have to practice twice a week, attend preparatory classes, and spend a lot of time on the road, they quickly lose enthusiasm.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
He is currently a member of the Tap Tap group.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place one day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Icheba Stadium, in Brno at the Fléda and Ostrava Club at the centre of Plynojem, with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by telecast at the time of the song "The Tap Tap's End of the World is Over".
The aim of the project is to raise funding of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Edlichka Institute in Prague.
The concert ticket is 400 kroner, the entrance is free for children under 12 years of age, and you can buy tickets in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has participated actively in a number of Agency projects over the following years.
But the way to space Poland started a long time ago.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts had been involved in space flights, but that was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the lecture given by A. Sternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which presented ideas from his pioneering work "Introduction into Space".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, and after several years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and André Luis Hirsch Prize in France for "Introduction into Space".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and space science.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned space promoter, and his contribution was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the opposite side of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a rocket - driven railway drone was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as did the details of the draft.
It's not even clear that a missile should have been used to disperse or to brake the trolley.
The only news about this nonsense is from the press of that era.
In 1933, Polish artillery began to think about rocket arrows.
The study was carried out by the Weapons Technology Section in cooperation with Professors Mázyslav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzytski.
The existing material shows that the studies have reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photovoltaic fighter rocket proposed by the engineer Rogozinsky appeared in a specialized press, and the following year the work of the author Lelivi-Kjiblocsky's “Aerial torpedo and aerial bomb” came out.
Both projects were designed for the military use of missile engines.
Before the war itself, all military missile projects were handled by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all activities.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended because of the outbreak of war.
The next space science paper appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first reference to society is in the November 1954 issue of the magazine “Problems”, which publishes four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich offered to organize a society that would be involved in space activities.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PAA) has tried to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and has been a member of the International Astronautical Federation since the fall.
The following year, the first President of PAA, Kazimez Zarankevich (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the RPA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful RM meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologyzna), which was the first Polish missile to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first was launched on October 10, 1958.
The missile, which could pass 1,800 metres, was about 80 cm long and weighing less than 5 kg.
An improved version of the RM-1A was subsequently built, and a two-stage RM-2 missile was tested on the Bledova Desert in the summer of 1959.
The missile was about 1.4 metres long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could have crossed 14.5 km and its mission was to observe the high wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The first RM-type missiles were inherited by the Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed to be two-stage, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which varied in size for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A missile had a volume of 0.4 litres, the Meteor-1V had a volume of 0.34 litres and the Meteor-1C had a volume of 0.62L.
All three types had a maximum range of 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 missile was developed at the Aviation Institute and its first flight test began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missile, with a launch weight of 380 kg, was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The versions of Meteor 2N and Meteor 3 were then built.
Mention should also be made of Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR national committee two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the law on community service is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Community Works Act.
The ruling sparked a lively debate in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is linked to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted private capital flows, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The large difference in the value of the labour force (wages) results in price stress.
This term should be understood as the state in which a producer, through the delivery of a cheap product, tries to compete economically by “cut” the value of a competitor in order to take a large part of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a massive scale, this means that most entrepreneurs either move production abroad, buy cheap purchases abroad, or disappear, leading to higher unemployment in countries where labour costs are higher than others.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for unemployment, the inevitable social spending of the State is on the rise.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of business masters to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social, economic and social damage they cause in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that there is no need for specific statistics.
Ceremony of private capital creates situations at the level of individual economies where national Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their populations in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, Governments have given their own populations to private capital, despite social declines.
This is reflected, first and foremost, in the changes to existing legislation.
The aim is to make their people economically comply with the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a means of reducing workers ' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty increases, but also the difference between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, for several years there has been a public distribution of food to the poor who are unable to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constant cases in which employed persons are paid such wages that the State must pay them more to ensure that they receive the minimum subsistence level.
A similar scandal has become known to the public in the case of additional Bundestag workers.
Economic measures in almost all of the EU’s southern states undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status are forced either to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live in poverty on the margins of society, hoping that private investment capital will one day enter the country.
I wonder, though, where will it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still work for a share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim to be nauseous that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the State should not interfere with the economy by its managers.
The next question to be answered is whether private capital, now practically in charge of politics and the whole state, is not acting for its own selfish ends?
The answer is definitely yes.
Evidence is the existence of virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobbyes in all States.
As a result, we have a desperate situation of corruption, mutual benefit, in legislation where almost everyone deserves punishment but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is that government ministries, due to lack of funding, entrust the drafting of legislation to private law firms that are closely linked to industry.
These bills are then approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western constitution says, but from financial-power groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal and oriented democracy is now rapidly finding itself in a situation such as that described by Appian in the work "Crisis of the Roman Empire in Caesar's and Pompeii's Days": "The State has long been disintegrating and agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribery, illegal receiving of favors with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any ban, and the people went to the election with a pre-sold vote” ... decent people did not run for the office of ruler at all, eventually one day the state was left without a consul for eight months.” "The only salvation in this terrible situation was self-control and the need to choose a strong man."
As in ancient times, today’s society is dominated by its own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is no longer intended to be used for public purposes.
The present result is no different from the past: the unimaginable decline of the elite without any attempt to introduce deeper reforms.
So we must look for the cause of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalization of economies for 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be seen as a pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the law on community service is not a solution, or at least not a permanent solution.
Under pressure of competition at both the international and the national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen State participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the State and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: Laboratory of chaos.
Sting, the song "Fast," where the main verse of the refreen is "don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't be" - the dying Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Meer Amchel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, elicited many reactions.
Some argue for Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence and that the Palestinians are terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing for the racism of the Israeli State, genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on who in these recurring waves of killings is a criminal and who the victim, after all, is today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation and did not witness the outbreak of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to see who is primarily served by the 95-year-old tension (due to the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is, above all, the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their own steps, or whether there has been someone behind their throne who has guided their actions towards predetermined goals.
It must be assumed that we live in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have taken place in one generation.
Among astronomically rich families, there is one that could be seen as the head of a sprout (I don't know if anyone is standing above them, but that's not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
They don't say much about them.
Of course.
They bought the first news agency (Reuters) back in the 1990s to stop rumours linking their name to the criminal activities in the higher spheres in which they lived, which have always led to the strengthening of their power, the increasing of wealth, or both.
They have large shares in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have shares, they are waging or preparing war (there were only seven before the invasion of Afghanistan, five after the invasion of Iraq, only four after the overthrow of Gaddafi, but at the same time the Russian Government took the central bank of its country into its own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of a central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, and during the civil war he began to release his own (understanding government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy started making his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed, was killed in 1963, and Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to a plan for three world wars created by the great Mason of 33, Albert Pike.
The purpose of the first war was to destroy the monarchy States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially in Britain, and the third was to reduce the world ' s population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (so many slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume many resources), create a single universal religion (ecumenism could be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and finally seize absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, works is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (order ab hao - order out of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the Fed, which should have prevented the recurrence of the crisis that they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unleash the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia by starting a Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended with the military and economic surrender of Germany (there was no need for war to destroy the royal Russia) and, as a result, the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary, was fragmented.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge military reparations on Germany, which created a pre-condition for radicalizing the impoverished masses, and then left only to throw at the Germans a strong enough to denounce the guilty and to propose simple solutions to the Chief, to further create a multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed to play the role of a fifth column, in fueling the fire of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historical Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created a prelude to the massive immigration of Jews into Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was initially held by bankers, or what he did was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for the Second World War, the State of Israel was declared to create a third war.
If international bankers succeed in opening it, the Jewish people, as they did in the Second World War, will be the victims of hostilities on the front line, now with the Arab or, in short, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless cycle of violence if it all began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here, it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are pushing people to vote in elections exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu Hawk, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker who does everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, ...), will threaten to escalate into a world conflict, and given Iran’s control over the Strait of Hormuz, which contains 20 per cent of the world’s oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also destroy the world economy.
In the light of what David Rockefeller said in 1994, “All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order”.
The new world order in its representation is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born organism is implanted at birth with a chip with which it becomes a being under total control.
"And makes all the small and the big, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves, to have a brand on their right hand or forehead, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
That is wisdom: everyone with a mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Operation Argo": When it's worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist demonstrators seized the United States Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, who had fled the US revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, a positive outcome was not expected - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, it was not in a position to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to release hostages by force.
The prisoners were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations facilitated by the Government of Algeria.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which culminated in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo", describes one episode of the story that brought small victories to America.
Shortly before the Embassy's occupation, six employees managed to escape.
After a difficult period, they finished their journey to the Canadian Embassy residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to remove them from Iran, while aided by an extravagant cover legend according to which they travelled through Canadian passports as members of a film crew seeking space in the country to film a science-fiction epic.
Combination of genres
The plan that Tony Mendez's evacuation expert invented required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend credible, specialized magazines have written about the film's project, press conferences have been held, a fictional production company has a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called movie-kinopus, the story of a successful idea, the scams, is an example of a series of films about Ocean's friends.
The film is constantly changing the moods - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the credits show symbolic historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there is no great difference).
On the other hand, lightened Hollywood passages intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from CIA headquarters and other agencies-- the men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, on the agency ladders, on the phone...
Ben Affleck was very good at getting his career back on track.
From a mocking actor, he became a respected director, and his game was no longer the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third full-length film, after the dark detective "Goodbye, baby, good-bye" (2007) and the city thriller (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film by Affleck that is not filmed in Boston's hometown.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place is one of the qualities that raised earlier filmmakers above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is showing it at Argo, where Tehran is playing Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, when real events are reconstructed - the entrance scenes of the embassy's fall are impressed by its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unforeseeability that arise when history suddenly changes somewhere.
The same effect is achieved by Affleck and his colleagues in the scenes of fiction (the fake headquarters in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many trials in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that narratives do not imply many exciting scenes of film significance.
He's pretty successful with this few, sometimes he thinks something out -- it's not so elegant (a scene where a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at Tehran airport, and a run on the runway looks pretty elaborate).
The drawback of Argo is the dispersal of the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman, as Hollywood colleagues, are indeed very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they're not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a little drama, a film that can be seen with moderate interest, evaluating the production and retro-style that recreates the 1970s thrillers.
But it's hard to get it.
However, this is enough to remind us of one thing, still in a certain sense a living history, and also to show how exaggerated the perception of almighty and all-knowing intelligence agencies is.
Inflating balloons, bananas and circus rules
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop".
“We were inspired by this latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies”, said the Prava questionnaire organizer Patrick Nager.
Among the absurdities already put forward is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of premiums for men and women.
So far, women have enjoyed life insurance benefits because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by people for the competition before the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place before the end of February 2013, said Nager.
The controversial EU regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of bio-components to fuel, resulting in damage to nature, and the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small quantities of hazardous substances, or the directive on the size of the chicken cage, which has resulted in a substantial increase in the cost of eggs this year.
The actual prohibition of the use of the term “butter oil” or the removal of classic bulbs from the market was also criticized.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European machinery often makes a decision under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or group of States (in this way the Czech Republic now even threatens to defend the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the EU were to reach a length of 14 centimetres and did not dare to display "agnostic curvature".
In doing so, the European Commission was justified by the fact that it only harmonizes existing fragmented national rules, which complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has nevertheless relaxed the standards for fruit and vegetables, arguing that existing directives will lead to waste of products.
Last year’s EU regulation that selling balloons must be accompanied by a warning that children under the age of eight cannot inflate them without the supervision of adults may also be a candidate for a poll.
The EU has turned to American studies according to which balloons in the game are a potential cause of death of children by strangulation.
This restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age, who are not allowed to blow into carnage.
Funny ideas are born at home, too.
The rule of European officials themselves is absurd: anyone who holds an official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name Macedonia, but should instead say “BURM” (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com portal, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, has proposed for voting, in addition to some of the absurd rules mentioned above, such as the EU regulation on the amount of food stocks on the territory of a member State.
The EU has established a maximum amount of food that may be available in the Czech Republic on the date of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the prescribed amounts of canned mushrooms, for which it was liable to a heavy fine.
The questionnaire organizers were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of providing subsidies for applications for subsidies.
But these ideas came from Prague, not Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We ask for compensation from the European Union,” said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palace (CSDP) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that there was a high yield of grain in the country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the State had full stores of stocks that had to be removed.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to Palas, should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for grain from landlocked countries.
Grant grants were offered to villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Pavel Nemz (US-DEU), in particular, such grants were to be drawn up for grants from Brussels.
EU: Curious orders are the exception
While regulations in member States are easily criticized, the EU’s efforts to regulate as well as to improve the functioning and development of the EU are, in the view of many experts, more worthy of recognition.
A serious problem, in the view of the experts, is the drawing of EU grants for projects that do not have even a hint of anything in common with deepening European integration, but that have been achieved by member States in the budget discussions.
It is emotional among Czechs that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic should fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting the Germans and the Austrians, retained the name "Olomowsky cheeses", the "Tuzem rum", whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, was to be renamed "Tuzemak".
The only products that can be called rum are cane distillate, not sugar beet.
The official list of EU-registered products, along with the world-famous “feta” and “gorgondzola” cheeses, the Marzipan of German Lubek or Parm ham, have already included, for example, Carlovar swarms, the Gorgeous and Trashbon Karp and the Champ.
The EU’s trademark can also be proud of the Pardubic carrot and the Montagnard straws.
People want me to protect the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man want to run for president?
I don't think about becoming a senator or president myself.
If everything was working in the country without a problem, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can't stand to see the country embezzling over the last 20 years, there being thieves, raising people's taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and I'm an independent person who's not a member of any party, I have no other way of influencing things than running for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I always said I'd fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
Later, I made it clear that if I were to be elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool that I can use to give effect to my views.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the greatest authority.
But the problem is not only that as a nation, we murmur in our own bar or TV, but we are ready to trample on anyone who tries to make a difference.
To this is added the media, which defame a person, and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For example, I was told that I was giving bribes to journalists, or that I was Girgi Paroubek's advisor.
Let's move on to your views.
You began the fight for the presidential castle by talking about the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and about the return of property declarations worth more than 20 million.
To do so, the law must be changed.
You don't have that power as president, and only an entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to do that?
When I lobbied as a citizen for the guided tour to become a free enterprise, it was moved forward.
The problem is politics – when someone comes with a good offer on the left or right, they are deliberately obstructed, and it deters citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan individual, I have a much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it without a look at dogmats.
Do you think you're more of a right or left person?
From a Czech point of view, I think I'm more of a leftist person.
It doesn't matter to me a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we go forward.
It's not about someone being right, it's about someone being left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for society whether it is proposed by the HRCM or the HPD, and I will also be against the bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some perfect goals and visions.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already functioning in the world, or they're being spoken of by eminent experts.
But without parliamentary support, you'll only have slogans.
And with that, you won't last long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you'll be able to enforce criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another chance.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to win them over so that we can get what we need.
Had I been elected President, there would have been no problem with a live television broadcast calling on the presidents of parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, government officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they'll have to tell you why they don't want to.
If there is a strong person who speaks of abuse, then there can be pressure on the political scene.
Take a direct presidential election - it was a public pressure.
I'm telling you directly that I'm an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and beliefs.
I'm just starting politics, and for my program, I'm gonna try to get the majority's support.
I'm trying to move things forward on my own; if that doesn't work out, I'll be done in six years, and I'll be back in the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura's supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm the only one who's gonna do nothing, so I've bypassed a number of famous people with an offer to run for Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchure, he refused because of the heavy workload.
I also at least supported the ongoing investigation of journalist Jan Lorenzov, who discovered fraud with light fuel oil products.
I've put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel like I'm on the scales.
Sixty per cent of the people did not go to the election, and most of those who went to the establishment did not.
There are only two of us independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate in such a way that the changes will be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about the basis of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to test the integrity of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have the money to do it.
There's no money for the presidential campaign, only 20,000 kroner in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and what's your own business with that?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million, and a Schcode Superb worth a million, and a few million more.
By the way, I had Aston-Martin because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove, was gallant with women, and at the same time fought against scorn and lawlessness.
You drive Aston Martin, you own $60 million worth of property, and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Am I supposed to be in debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that my program isn't that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my pocket.
The campaign costs are basically going to cover my Senator's salary.
But with that money, I wouldn't live, for example, to pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
So you're going to be doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut down on that?
But it doesn't depend on the salary.
As I promised, I have reduced my activities in part.
For example, my deputy will be the manager of the travel agency in the spring.
People would have wanted me to be a moneyless man who would keep the republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting monthly?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I keep getting.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You'll find a full interview in the Saturday issue of Law.
The MVRDV architects prove that real adventures aren't just in the imagination - in the case of Speykenisse and his recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, passing on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a nearby large enterprise, says, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has Internet, iPad, and e-books.
No one's voluntarily going to these old-fashioned libraries now, right?
Speykenisse, a small bedroom under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this unfortunate situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro notes, in the form of painted miniatures made of concrete concrete.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And that's when the city's fathers realized that they had the only chance to beat the statistics: build a library here!
Vene Maas of the Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, a master of bold column charts and author of witty, sometimes cynical, structures, took up the task with his usual unchallengedness and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and a smirk on his face.
And while the members of the jury were puzzled to look around and shrug their shoulders, the daring Maas laid down a pyramid in size from his original gift and concluded his speech in defence of his project with the words, "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal: "The Book Mountain" in Speikenisse, the so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, supermarket, postage and several adjacent housing units and townships with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second award of the 2012 Best Library of the Netherlands.
The project also participates in the 2012 Dutch National Wood Competition.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which had previously been able to offer nothing but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall whose white facades suggested a milk factory, became richer for one contemporary piece of architecture.
But most importantly, the first cultural public building in the town's history has appeared in Speykenisse.
A Long Way to the Book
First impression: Eldorado's book room under a cheese cap.
There's only one elevator in the middle of a mountain range, because real fans of architecture and reading would prefer to explore the area on foot.
Exposed from all sides - light and easy to see, brick floors and elegant street lights unmistakably create a sense of public urban square.
The urban environment has been re-established perfectly.
Looking at benches, dogs, and soccer boys and girls.
And there are books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally bookshelves stand along facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless," says Vini Maas.
We put the classic head-to-head configuration and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The inner area of the bookmount has been ably used: the centre houses offices, Internet libraries, a chess club, an environmental centre and technical facilities.
The black bookshelves, which serve as walls, parapets, and stairwells, are particularly encouraging.
Their appearance, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and builders are lost in their guesses as to what this unknown material is.
“We sought to work with secondary materials,” explains Yop Trauborst, the project manager representing the Spikeniss community, as required by the standard.
And one day, at a farm in France, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years now, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, artificial fibrous material of millimetre thickness has been used as a root lining.
It's cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons and can then be discarded.
For the library, this painting, for the first time in such volumes, was compressed in a panel of four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplasty (KLP) turns into dark, homogeneous, durable material, which smells a little like a new car and a little sneaker.
They're taking 105 steps to the top.
Those who travel nearly 500 metres in length will be rewarded in a literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and wood chips in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Cost of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model environmental project," says Trouborst.
The heat of the ground shall be used for heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun enters only briefly.
Large flatwood farms, perpendicular to the glass facades, provide shade and absorb most of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The remaining protection is provided by fully automatic roll curtains.
Stefan Spermon, the IT skeptic mentioned earlier, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhaig was here as well.
And also a Chinese traditional medicine teacher, Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of the Speykenisse that was long missed."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate a book from his own congregation.
These books were supposed to fill empty spaces on the shelves of a library that was not yet fully staffed; at that time, there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are locked up.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Vini Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has some connection to this new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it only serves as an ornament.
The MVRDV has thus been able to accomplish the royal task, which in the professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Speykenisse wrote his literary history.
And may they be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for building an identity.
Sabo: "The Germans must play a more important role."
Germany abstained in the vote on recognition of Palestine.
Stephen Sabo, an expert in US-Europe relations, believes that Berlin, by doing so, is balancing on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first indicated that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 uprising in Libya, Germany also abstained in the voting on the no-fly zone.
NATO eventually implemented the proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The point is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, from a policy that the US has so-called ruled to a German foreign policy itself.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are back between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just feeling their part, but they're on the road to "more normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy as it is pursued by France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from the German perspective?
It is a willingness to take a position in the national interest that is not dependent on the position of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. on exports and links to certain regions, such as Russia, China, or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests were largely different from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be careful not to offend the public and elites in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't put too much emphasis on it, it's not entirely one-sided.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German calculations.
Did Germany harm its relations with the US by abstaining from making important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I am sure that in Europe, and even in the United States, understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be taken into account.
There are different views about the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the US has clearly supported the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European states?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that Obama’s government, deep down, has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But, of course, due to the local political situation, the Government cannot openly adopt such a position.
I believe that the substantive differences of opinion are not as significant as they always seem.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, notice that Obama is not at all thrilled with Netanyahu’s politics.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of a crucial partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for Germans to have a single, consistent European policy, but it is not now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and have to act instead on their own vision.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
Understandably, this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it really take over?
Or is the lead still hard on Germany?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to this, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is always difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis — every time Germany takes on an important role, a variety of anti-German feelings manifest themselves.
Germans don't just deal with it.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much worse position than the US.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and opinions, which is not easy.
So, the US influence in European politics is constantly waning, but at the moment the EU is not filling this vacuum, who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if you don't like it, it's unpleasant, or it increases your dislike, it's life.

Trademark Security in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is an entirely officially registered name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from whose names it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names bring a claim.
But it is still unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloh, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing, who specializes in trademark violations in the Far East.
My desk shows up every week on a new case of this kind.
Simulators need only add a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci it's Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German enterprises, such as the Puma manufacturer of sports goods, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with the records of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions of copying and intellectual property infringement is well known.
In large cities, there are multi-storey stores selling almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, the Pattloch cases were not the same; on instructions from his trustees, he was opposed to Chinese enterprises being formally authorized by the trademark registry to use a name that was already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it the Ban Minpei, the Marka Passenger.
It's a word associated with "ban Dakuan."
That's what they call women who hunt rich men.
Chinese authorities do not plead guilty
"It's detrimental to business, it needs to be fought," Pattloch is convinced.
"The brand is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image is badly damaged."
The financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of high-value copying products.
According to CLSA, China, with a sales volume of Euro15 billion per year, is the third largest and fastest growing luxury market.
However, the removal of questionable records from the trademark register is difficult and costly.
The trial can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch describes the cases in which the court dismissed the claims, as after a long period of time the disputed name became a “market reality”.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarizer because he damaged his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous graphics cases.
In 2009, Daimler lost a litigation with the Sany manufacturer, a company that had recently acquired the Putzmeister concrete pump company.
So the Chinese still have the right to use the Mercedes-like emblem.
The company that bought Volvo was originally using a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
In China, Lacoste, a fashion producer, lost to simulators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had a famous crocodile looking the other way.
The Chinese authorities don't think they're guilty.
The Trademark Registration Office of CMMO in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to lack of staff and facilities.
But last year, there was a "return from business emergency to normal."
Thus, the number of pending appeals cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending in the office.
It's expensive to fight.
As is so often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTC received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has led the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive time, reporting by the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
Simplisticly, this means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth many times more to challenge, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarizer.
The Germans succeeded in eliminating their illegal production of fake auto parts.
However, the simulator reserved Chinese trademark rights to Freudenberg.
This was a failure of its own, as the surnames in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Ventzler, chairman of the Board of Directors of Freedenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the trademark authority of CTMO rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg won in both of the following instances, but the opposing side is still fighting.
We need to be alert.
The matter was currently before the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the matter to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes up a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs are hardly accounted for, and the firm's records have even had to be reviewed from 100 years ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a “greater six-digit amount in euros” for a settlement.
"It's clear from here how much it costs us," Ventzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to move even to Europe.
That is, if the simulators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The concert had long ceased production in those areas, but had nevertheless been able to prevent registration.
"You need to be on your guard," says Ventzler.
Both he and Pattloch counsel recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions on trademark protection, but rather on foreigners to “register anything worth protecting in China,” says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it may cost a lot more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the wrong party licence fees for his own name, explains Ventzler.
Otherwise, we'll be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: trampling, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbong chorus rehearses — and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of a relationship that spanned more than 8,733 kilometres.
First, there's drowning: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats, and men's slippers pick up the tact on the floor and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
It is only then that the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly grow - they approach, charm, and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost pops out of his cloth shoes when he guides them with flexible and striking gestures.
Monday night, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbong chorus rehearses a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor, attended the rehearsal.
"Om "Obani" is a difficult thing, every voice of the choir has its own text, and it is in a totally foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help
Unaids estimates that the United Nations AIDS programmes are home to some 34 million people worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitzheni, Voices for Africa found chiefs in Germany.
Seventy of them attend a school that prepares for further education.
You can take over 15 or 20 euros a month.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot meal in Gogo Centre.
Imbong in Zulu means a storyteller or a praiser.
This room doesn't speak fluently to the Banta, but they can sing.
For almost a decade, the choir has learned songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally even brings them back to where they first appeared: southern Africa.
After all, 8733 kilometers of summer from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the kingdom of Swaziland, lies the village of Esitzheni, which depends on the votes of the German choir.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, and many children.
More than 300 of them have been left without parents who have died of the IP virus.
In Esitzheni, a miniature depicts the disease of Swaziland as a whole: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of men’s foreskin, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted in the population.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland ' s population was suffering from an immunodeficiency virus, and death in the middle of the fourth dozen was not uncommon.
The Glee Club opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, but previously Imbogni saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but also everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment by individual participants - a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa", which has since been almost professional in caring for AIDS orphans in Esitzheni.
Evidence of sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (honoree).
HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are common viruses.
The pubic lice and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the main target groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that in at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual intercourse between men.
Heterosexual adults often suffer from sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candosis (grybok), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
HIV prevalence among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infection is significantly higher than among other population groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
We also have a high incidence of human papilloma virus among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can give rise to ulcers in the genital area, complaints of urination, excretion, pain at the bottom of the abdomen, and bubbles or seals.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and go unnoticed.
How can you defend yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide 100 per cent protection.
In part, sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through contact infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular testing, especially when sexual partners change frequently.
An early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid remote effects.
Charms, donations, and not least choir fees all over Germany, it's possible to gather something.
"We've sent it all to Esitgeni for about 200,000 euros," says Annethe Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, the money from Germany is administered by Zdwa Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also makes sure that orphans are well - arranged, for example, by one of her grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call Zulu old women, is the backbone of the village.
Some have taken in up to 14 orphans, sheltered them, and ensured that children in uniform attend classes on time every day.
Those who have no family go to the Haniysil shelter, a single woman who is paid by the association, as do two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two henhouses and, together with the United States health organization PSI, organized HIV testing for many villagers.
It's hard to imagine, but the disease that's so obvious across the country prefers to be very silent.
The King With 14 Wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
It's quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, this State-sanctioned lifestyle is also blamed for the rapid spread of the HDI virus in past years.
But it's also on vagrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are on every corner, says Annet Lennartz, "but they're hardly used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh."
To support cultural exchanges a little bit, Ibmonny's choir travels to southern Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sadness, morale, confidence and black identity, which many on the southern side of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in black - such recognition not only brings good cheer and joy, but has even caused tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip also always brings children to Esitzheni, where the singers visit underhand.
Although it is difficult to find a small village on a map, it is more than known in the Etzulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitgeni, there's light," said the people here.
And after an 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the stomping singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is on fire here as well.
NASA is opening ice on Mercury.
The Messanger probe found evidence that there is ice on Mercury's planet.
Ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick.
NASA's space agency has proven the existence of ice on Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger probe found evidence that the region of the planet, which is constantly in the shadows, is covered with ice.
It should be at least 30 centimeters thick, and possibly even 20 meters thick.
Presumably, water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid that bumps into Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific leader of the probe Sean Solomon.
Mercury's temperature can be as high as 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building elements of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
Invisible to the Earth's inhabitants are probes, telescopes, and small robots, such as Phoenix, exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small windows to endless givers.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who is approaching the Sun for Neptune, Ceres, by a new definition of an international astronomical union in 2006, is not a planet.

Depending on the color transmission, images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
Published by the European South Observatory, the images show the trifid nebula in the constellation of the Arrow, which is thousands of light-years away.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (three-dole, three-separated), as the dark dust bands are divided into three parts of the heated heart of the cradle of stars.
In the constellation of the Viper, astronomers photographed the harbinger of a space collision: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the cores of the two converging galaxies are heading toward each other and will inevitably meet.

Researchers assume that it occurred shortly before the Big Bang, when most of the universe was hydrogen.
Our View of the Universe: Critical Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey, even before Galileo Galileo later began monitoring the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become ever more numerous, and the space available to their eyes has become ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror shown here was five meters in diameter.
In Arizona, U.S.A., there's a Big Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescope Canarias has a giant inner device, with a mirror only 10.4 metres in diameter.
The Great South African Telescope Mirror in South Africa is segmented to lower costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches about 11 meters in diameter.
Lack of low-cost design performance: The telescope is rigidly attached at a vertical angle, limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
It's a feature: high light-collection capacity.
It reaches, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With a radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope is 305 metres in diameter.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Mind (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing his computing power.
A view of the Observatory of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) in the Andes of Chile.
There's a "Very Large Telescope" here, which is completely consistent with its name.
Its four mirrors allow the visual tube to light even the medium infrared spectrum.
The European “Very Large Telescope” is also planned to be installed at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror should be spread as far as 42 meters, and it will be made of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photographs should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Kek telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano, Mauna Kea, were considered to be the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors 10 metres in diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into the sky with the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a 30-metre-diameter mirror, should appear on Mauna Kea.
Here, you can see it in illustrations.
However, the most important species from space are supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been producing paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, primarily those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 planets had been identified since the start of the mission.
The photo shows the latest preparations for the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space until 2018 on board the Ariane 5 missile.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the Messenger revolves closer to the northern pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have shown that Mercury has ice on it.
Thanks to the 2004 Messenger probe, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now believe it.

Finding a clue in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
Traveling through the Trash Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
A loud minibus runs down a swirly road past dense forested hills, stormy rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything is so green and bright, you'd think you were in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometres away.
The Talysh, one of the peoples of the Caucasus, who is not well - known, lives here, except that they speak fine Farsi and Azeri and are long - lived.
The end point is Leric.
A small town boasts too much of the Soviet architecture, which is not at all in harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
It takes eight hours to reach a distance of 323 kilometres, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the Caspian oil is here in the province before it gets here.
However, Pilate Fatulayev (48) is convinced that there is much to interest tourists in Lerik.
"In May Baku was famous for the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulaeva says.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
There's a biography of about eight dozen of these places that are over 100 years old, Fatulaeva pointing to a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child
But the museum's controversial star is the Chaban Shirali Muslumov, who reportedly turned 168 years old.
No birth certificate, however.
And given that the oldest person whose age is documented is 122 years old, Myuslumov's age is extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulayev.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and he reportedly had a daughter at the age of 136.
So did the Chuban of Muslum add a few decades to its age?
Even Rembrandt Scholtz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of long-term residents in Central Asia.
“A remarkable number of older people can also be found in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholtz says, “Sardinia also has a very large number of very old people.”
However, due to the lack of documentation, scientific proof of age is not possible, as there were no civil registers.
Every day, a glass of hot oil.
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the Leric area are surprisingly likely to reach Bible age.
It is now home to 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many long-term residents here in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzade explains this with the special genes of the Talish.
The director of the Fatulayev Museum, on the contrary, believes it's about nutrition.
Talyshs love meat, bread, and dairy products the most, and many drink a glass of fueled oil every day, but it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be nutritionally healthy.
Or is it a primal way of life that keeps people young?
At 97, it is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of butter that she never tires of driving back and forth.
There are eight people living under the same roof, including one of Mirzaeva’s sons and daughter, who have long had their grandchildren.
There's also two babies in the neighborhood.
In the kitchen, guests are served tea, which is served in typical belly glasses of Armud.
Mirzaeva has perfectly smooth and strong white teeth under her headscarf, and she hides the long dark-red braids her son proudly reveals to us.
I'm always my hair with milk, so it never fell out and kept color.
"And I never used shampoo," says Mirzaeva.
A monthly pension is sufficient for a living.
She always only ate what she grew up in her own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought groceries in my entire life.
Then she tells of her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was after World War II.
But it got better when the "loved father" Geidar Aliyev took over.
Propaganda doesn't often sound in an old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows almost no boundaries.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son, Ilham, took over.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azeri elderly.
Mirzaeva receives 230 manats (approximately the same amount as the euro) monthly as a pension, for local conditions it is an amount that can be lived well.
And perhaps Mirzaeva's long-grown son is also right: "The old women in our culture have a great deal of respect."
They live in a large family, loved, cared for and happy.
There's no reason to stay alive for as long as possible.
The word “human rights” does not exist in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo attest to the deep division of the country.
A future Constitution based on sharia has met with a fierce opposition.
The Egyptian president didn't give up on the pathos.
We have to create a transition.
"And his success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all to the Christian Cops, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said that he had temporarily reduced the competence of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competence “to save the revolution”.
But what really wants to save is a 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate from the U.S. University of Southern California, it's not clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of its power?
In fact, 234 articles were dragged through a 15-hour night jump with obstacles at an Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly alarming.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the judicial process is based on “the principles of Islamic law”.
But what do you mean, "principles"?
This has been and continues to be a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use vague language and the resulting legal play to better interpret the sharia.
At least one new article insinuates this: Al-Achar University, the country ' s most important Islamist institution, with great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be involved in all matters relating to sharia.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy supervise the law, which would have the de facto effect of restricting the judiciary.
There is much to be interpreted in the draft constitution.
Another problem is that civilian jurisdiction must remain with the military court.
These courts, during Mubarak's period of power, served to suppress the opposition.
Since the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians have been held in military detention.
Similarly, as stated in the draft, the State must protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “support its morality and values”.
Legally, this is so vague that public institutions will be able to control even the content of film and literature through this article.
Open text means nothing more than censorship.
No article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
However, the other prohibits insulting and denigrating the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also questionable whether “insulting” is prohibited.
Would a cartoon of the president or a joke about a lawyer be enough?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this draft which Morsi proposes for signature and which he says will be put to the Egyptians in a referendum “very soon”.
"Revolution's back."
For weeks now, opposition to the superiority of Islamists has been emerging.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity on Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the international Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution had a place “in the dump of history”.
Through Twitter, he accused Morsi's followers of wanting to lead a road trip against democracy.
“If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw it away,” oppositionist Yasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, our brothers' blood has not yet been avenged," quoted the Egyptian media of opposition policy, Khaled Ali.
Many judges also indicated that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would render it null and void.
"The Koran is our Constitution."
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
A large number of women under the blankets and Salafites were present, shouting, “People demand the application of God's law”.
They asked Morsi to clean up the country, and they said, "This is our Constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic square on which it all began provoked a state of almost civil war.
Morsi's followers obviously didn't want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide by the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
Most for the Islamist project, it's a done deal.
"The notion of human rights is never mentioned."
Hafiz Abu Sa'eda is furious at this forceful constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February with the participation of all public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the Chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (ECHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or tried under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their world view, but because human rights were indivisible for him.
For this, he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never appear in the new constitution, he regrets talking to "Welt am Sonntag."
Morsi’s expansion of influence over all three branches of government in the State disappoints the lawyer.
These measures represent clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening a civilian State, the President de facto cancelled it”, Saeda regrets.
Without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which is looking at the ideological struggle of directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There could be a payback for that.
A demonstration in Tahrir Square warns, "You're creating a monster you can't control."
Norwegian Racfisk: The worst-smelling fish in the world?
Norway's five million people have one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe, but throughout the world.
Perhaps the mystery of this country's success has something to do with the local addiction to one extremely reeking fish dish?
Take some over-ripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're going to get a bad smell of russian, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's beautiful, but there's an unbreakable distinctive smell in the air.
Raffisque is a trout sprinkled with salt and wandered in the water for a year, depending on what kind of love to get.
As twilight gathers and cold, Norwegian crowds gather for a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this, let's say, exciting meal.
"She eats raw and drinks a glass of aquavit, a local tomato vodka," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local fireman in the profession and co-leader of the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat fish cut in small cubes and drink a lot of alcohol.
"Someone likes the aquavit more than the rusfisk," says Howard.
This drink can kill the smell.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not that bad, it's not much different from the sushi you've been carrying around on the bus for a long time.
Raffisque is a Norwegian product from a very different time, a time of poverty, when, before refrigerators appeared, fish were soaked in hermetically closed salt water barrels in the fall.
Then in the middle of the winter, when the fish were already well and thoroughly fermented, it was removed, and when the perception of alcohol was muted, it was used in food.
Back in the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly to the US.
The population is now growing rapidly, with more than 13 per cent of immigrants benefiting from jobs, high wages and a well-developed social security system.
The people of Sweden (a longtime rival, not so long ago, and a much richer neighbour) come to work here on a massive scale.
Raffisque is perceived as an important symbol, an essential, though somewhat odious, element of Norway’s past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, it's all expensive, a small glass of beer or a sandwich that'll cost you £9 (14 US dollars).
Norway rarely appears on the world news, and most people in the country seem to be comfortable with that.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the terrorist attack is called "the 22 July incident."
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens was capable of committing such atrocities and killing.
Norway's current well-being is based on the growth (from the early 1970s) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"However, oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, who delivers trays with rakfi, a woman with long blond hair and amazingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are a people who understand, as you call it.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks great English.
We don't like to show up, we're not bragging.
Norway has been very careful with its oil, most of the oil and gas revenues being invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was wasting money they didn't have, Norway was careful in calculating all the costs.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and go camping in the summer, that's enough to be happy," Anna says.
"And there's a cancer," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food. I've had enough of the shellfish.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat-- it's definitely exotic, it's delicious juicy meat.
But there's still more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell waiting for us tonight.
There's a special dinner at my hotel about racfiscus, during which the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish is identified by the voters.
There's a live TV set showing a lead in a bow tie surrounded by plates with a racfi.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Yurgen, what's your score for the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everybody laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off a chair, probably oversizing the aquavita.
Or maybe just by snorting the smell of that fish.
The President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is facing a difficult career start.
As Mexico's newly elected President, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
The traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly poor state.
The city is overburdened with transport and at its best, and steel barriers have been erected since Monday, cutting several key highways to the capital and causing road chaos.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from reaching the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will wear a presidential tie and take over the country.
He has a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico had achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, which was now relinquishing its powers, but the country had become mired in the war on drugs, which had claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My Government declares its readiness to fight violence to the people of Mexico”, Mr. Peña Nieto told President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House earlier this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto ' s political career with the President of the United States developed as Governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital, views were divided on the new leader.
A Direct Man
In the Idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, he is remembered warmly.
Residents have paid tribute to the revitalization of tourism, the development of resorts and the construction of infrastructure.
One of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which is quite different from those with pits and pits that were previously built at the site, can reach the city.
His name tags are on the modern sports centre building and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We place his hopes in real and serious change,” his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state congressman from Peña Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, particularly in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous rule, the PRI party was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the president's palace, Los Pinos, the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he refutes the allegations of lack of substance made by the opposition to the new President.
He is very direct and very committed to his vision of the future of the country.
He's an excellent statesman, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of a former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualkoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nessa, is the most striking contrast with the powerful streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under motorway relays, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe.
Earlier this year, troops had been mobilized to curb drug gangs in those areas; violence against women was particularly acute.
Several dozen bodies of murdered women have been found in the desert near an extensive dump in the last two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during the governorship of Mr. Peña Nieto, a figure significantly higher than in the notorious violent city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name became negative when it came to the murder of innocent women.
According to Mr. Peña Nieto ' s opponents, he could at best be said to have been unable to cope with the issue of the killing of women during his tenure as Governor.
At worst, his administration was accused of completely ignoring the problem.
Inhabitant of a concrete house similar to most of the houses in this dilapidated area, Irinaya Buendia struggles to contain tears by showing me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
Mariana officially committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner killed her.
"When I got to her house, it looked like her body was washed before," recalls Ms. Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten and her body was already hardened.
Mariana's mother recounts the story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where she hangs next to the crucifix, where only one word is written: justice.
That, they said, was the case with the family.
"State officials treated me like an old gossip who was dissatisfied with the troublemaker.
They want people to just take faith in everything they say and keep quiet.
But it's wrong, you can't, especially when there's so many irregularities and flaws around here," she says.
When President Peña Nieto wears a presidential tie on Saturday, he will take on a heavy responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico had been affected by violent crimes, and the new President had promised to make the solution of that problem a priority during his reign.
"I hope he'll be the same president as the governor," says Olver, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
But that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nes fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain of ill-treatment, pleads charges.
The prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations about poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning ' s stay at the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense demands that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's conditions of detention were harsh.
The U.S. Army is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, had not taken many opportunities to file a complaint for ill-treatment, which he claimed he had suffered while in military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Mede, Maryland, the Military Prosecutor, Major Ashden Fein, stated that records of weekly visits to Manning by prison authorities during the nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, contained no complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination of the defence motion to dismiss Manning on the grounds that his conditions of detention were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment was conducted the day after Manning stated that he had intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During the hearing on Friday, Prosecutor Fain, together with Manning, reviewed the reports that had been completed after the administration ' s visits to Manning during his stay at Quantico Prison, where he was held in strict confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Fain asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he considered the treatment of himself by the prison administration to be “excellent” and the general conditions of detention to be “very professionally organized”.
The reports examined do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manning's being specifically asked about the conditions of his detention, Fane claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concern about the problems and that the authorities who visited him had discussed the problems with him and stated that they would be dealt with but not recorded in writing.
"They recorded "no problem" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't bring it up in the conversation," Manning says.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lindh, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his ill-treatment in January 2011 at a meeting of the commission considering the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted him to be removed from the “injury warning” regime and to ease the conditions of detention.
The military authorities explained that the limited detention regime, which was lower than the surveillance regime for suicide prevention, had been introduced for the protection of the prisoner as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm all right so they can cancel the injury prevention regime... so my life would improve, from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to a naval prison in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thought of suicide in Kuwait, and that he had lost consciousness one day because of the heat.
He explained that it's psychologically hard not to know how your fate is handled and what's going on in the outside world.
"My world has come down to Camp Arifjan base, up to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I was gonna die in that cage."
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only his mattress, blanket, flippers, some clothes and glasses.
He says he tried to move, because sleeping or even sleeping in the daytime prohibited the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly struck in the eyes by light entering the outside of the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around in bed at night, he said that he was woken up and forced to turn on his back.
Manning ' s lawyer formally objected to Manning ' s ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
Furthermore, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about a statement he had made during his testimony on Thursday that, after one night he had been forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he had been forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at the morning inspection.
Manning stated that he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
In response to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he should throw a blanket to cover his back, but admitted that no one had directly ordered him to throw it.
On Thursday, Manning stated that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a pair of panties or flippers to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, flippers and glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had been through during his detention and significantly reduce his sentence if Manning was found guilty by a military court, which was to start his case early next year.
The defence stated that it planned to ask Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes and to challenge other charges as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was detained in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of detainees under the strictest possible regime.
The charges brought against Manning include aiding and abetting the enemy, unlawful assistance in the disclosure of data on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national defence and the theft of State property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is a Mexican American story.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are torn between two cultures.
During my recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the arrival corridor, approached the border control area and froze on the spot.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexiconos (Mexicans), the other for Extraanjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called a Mexican my whole life.
It's just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think they're Italian.
Later, I discussed the complex design of "American of Mexican origin".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's home country, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and became a line for Extranjeros.
I recalled that story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The issues on the agenda of the Presidents of those countries were immigration, drugs and trafficking.
President Peña Nieto was eager to speak of the recovery of the Mexican economy, which would make it possible for Mexicans to remain in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to enter into a partnership agreement with the US and Canada and create a North American trading bloc like the EU.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and long-standing matter.
Most Americans never thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory at gunpoint.
But Mexicans have been thinking for centuries, not minutes, and seeing reminders of those events in everything.
So when only a US statesman utters a word of criticism toward Mexico, the press and the elites of Mexican society immediately complain that Americans are encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And Montesuma's descendants are filled with militancy.
Mexico’s most difficult relationship with over 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States is, however, the most difficult.
Do you want to talk about resentment?
That's enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities in this country, and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican origin for one reason only: at some point in their family history, someone, father or grandfather, was unable to realize himself in Mexico and had to go north.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a certain type - brown, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
That's not how Mexico sees it.
Today, our lives are the embodiment of America's dream, and we've been in good schools and we've got good jobs, but we can remember that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider as its own.
United States of America.
We also know that most members of the Mexican elite and ruling class don't like us.
We tell them the same thing.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as fake Mexicans.
We do not speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind a silk curtain right now, finding a full life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States when she was a child, which reminds me that there are certain tensions between real Mexicans and Mexican-Americans - Mexicans are more aware of their national identity, and Mexican-Americans are offended.
She's a U.S. citizen and thinks she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances of Mexican American origin do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican band Los Tigers del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of the two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we're Americans.
And in the United States, they call us Mexicans.
Now, as I learned during my trip, as if our relationship was not yet complicated enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to re-establish relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent their interests in the US.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too much resentment in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us don't think this country is so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still angry about how they treated their relatives in Mexico recently.
Yeah.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East possible?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
The usual senseless debate over who started it; many buildings were turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; for the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip fell in the vicinity of the Israeli capital, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, while Israelis and Palestinians have become hopelessly entangled in their eternal conflict, changes have taken place in the Middle East.
This may be viewed in different ways, but the events of the Arab Spring have encircled many established realities in the rebel storm, and the Palestinians and the Israelis have not been able to stay away from the whirlwind that shocked the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons for hope that this deadly impasse will be overcome.
War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on 21 November, were to be implemented, the clashes this week only strengthened the positions of the forcemen on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will claim that they forced Israel to retreat despite its losses.
Despite the fact that some faction leaders have been destroyed and 1.7 million people blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled parts of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new powerful and rich friends.
The reborn regional leader of Turkey, once Israel’s closest ally among Muslim countries, has supported Hamas; its example has been followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic States in the Persian Gulf.
Hamas’s solemn supporters have announced the establishment of an Islamist crescent around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where Hezbollah’s militia is ruling, to Syria, where increasingly Islamic rebels are about to overthrow the power of Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the King’s power is threatened by Hamas’s allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement was strengthened under President Mohammed Morsi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator with little emphasis on support for Hamas.
On the contrary, Muslim brothers are an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more likely to be populist.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas can become a meaningful player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the hardline line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli Iron Dome missile system has borne the cost of its development and successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas.
Israeli citizens can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the US has remained committed; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last round of violence.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, particularly under the Binyamin Netanyahu Government, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although approximately 30 Israelis had been killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip since 2004, Israel had managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly through the wall, which entered the West Bank, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and protected Jewish settlements, which continued to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the 22 January elections - has joined forces with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is very comfortable.
What is the point of condoning the Palestinians and giving them their own State?
If they hand over all the power in the West Bank, would they not start firing rockets from there towards Israel, as their brothers in the Gaza Strip do?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and severely suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
The supporters of the hardline may win; however, their calculations may be refuted by the Arab spring.
While the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priorities will be internal problems.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than all its Arab neighbours combined.
The outbreak of war with a regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments to strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egyptian President Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, no less, take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic change takes place in Arab countries, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is a time bomb that will eventually explode in Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Reprisals were already undermining the foundations of a democratic order in a Jewish State, and the demographic dimension — the growth of the Arab population — only exacerbated those problems.
The bloody operations that are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to be paid for by the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need external momentum
The only solution remains that has been relentlessly called for by sound representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two States and Israeli concessions of territories in exchange for security.
There remains hope, not too overwhelming in the short term, that a ceasefire will enable other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, long overdue in its decision to cut off arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, are more than ever in a position to persuade Hamas to accept the borders of the Jewish State that have been adopted since 1967, given the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries must also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
That would do more to create a Palestinian State than the forthcoming United Nations vote, which could result in recognition of Palestinian virtual statehood.
President Obama has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
When he returned to the White House, he continued to show reluctance to engage in the problem.
This is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the Uniform Carcase Act has entered into force.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and images of diseased body parts are contrasted with sad green boxes that are the same for all cigarette stamps.
The first worldwide Australian law on the same-type packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products has entered into force, replacing logos and coloured brands with a similar box of sad olives with creepy images of diseased parts of the body and images of children whose health has been compromised by smoking by their parents.
In addition to the various images and inscriptions that warn of the harm of smoking, the only difference between the packs that are mandatory from this Saturday is the names of stamps that are printed in the same small print.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to discourage young people from smoking by depriving them of this harmful fashionable habit.
This decision was based on studies that showed that people who had not started smoking before the age of 26 had never become smokers in 99 cases out of 100.
“It is clear that even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to communicate through packaging,” explains Health Minister Tanya Plybersec, citing studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess in children.
Australia was one of the countries with the lowest smoking rates in the world, so that changes would not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries were already considering doing so.
The tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of the law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will have serious consequences other than those intended by its initiators," says Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
The producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply many more of these items for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the other hand, new laws encourage business growth.
Sandra Ha of a small family company, Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for cigarette and silicone cases covering unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (practically from zero) since companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their case in a high court in Australia, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about 6,000 items to wholesalers and is expecting a new shipment.
It's a good business for us.
In the view of experts, the popularity of social networks among the target population is a potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures.
Following the adoption of a number of laws in Australia that have made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support for sporting events and that prohibit vendors from displaying cigarettes, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government has banned local companies and websites from placing advertisements online, but it cannot restrict overseas websites.
"If you're selling tobacco and you've only got this little loophole left, "the idea of promoting your product on the Internet would seem very tempting to you," says Becky Freeman, researching public health issues at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increasing number of brand reviews written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users on social media such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the work of a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he spared no effort and time and made a video, or is there an advertising company behind it?
British American Tobacco, Australia, claims that the industry is now more involved in adapting to the new rules than in advertising.
The tobacco industry had even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: those States were making claims in the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade had been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that all those countries had very little trade relations with Australia.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plybersec, the Government was discussing with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory smoking-risk photographs.
More than 40 countries now have this rule, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering tightening their laws.
Many smokers in Australia are showing a lack of innovation.
These pictures don't bother me.
I just don't pay attention.
"Just taking a cigarette and hiding a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a photograph of a mouth tumor on a pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can get me to leave is my little daughter.
James Yew, head of the tobacco store King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, claims that the same packaging made it more difficult to place goods in shelves.
"It took me an hour to unload the new shipment and now four hours," he complains.
"The government should have taken and banned cigarettes altogether, and we would have said, 'What do we do, okay, it's over, we close the store,' he says, throwing his hands up.
Boring in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad.
On Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had a mechanical malfunction and was replaced by another plane, which we waited for.
So I had plenty of time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and neither books, magazines, iPhones, nor even duty-free shops will help much.
However, more and more scholars and child development specialists have recently expressed their support for boredom.
They say that in certain situations it's not so bad for us and our children to miss.
This causes the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may be conducive to creativity.
And because in today's world we're all constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Perhaps we should seek boredom.
Yeah.
At the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, like many people, that boredom was an invention of recent times, when people had more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Canada, author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient story," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin signs of boredom dating back to the first century.
The question remains as to how we understand boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor, University of York, Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying the research on the subject and asking a 100-person target group, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people “want but cannot do what would please them”.
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn't do anything that he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything with apathy.
The main thing in the boredom, he says, is "the disruption of attention and the resulting deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is running slowly."
The description of boredom may seem quite like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these states, bored people see the causes of the problems in the world and the circumstances around them, while depressed people see the problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's just hard to focus on something.
In his study “The Unemployed Mind: A Definition of Boring from a Attention Point”, published in September's issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues refer to an earlier experiment where participants listened to a recording of the magazine's voice.
Some participants also heard loud sounds of an unrelated television program in the next room, others heard the same sounds in low volume, so that they could barely be broken down, and a third group listened only to the recording of the voice without a foreign sound track.
Those who heard TV with low volume said that they were bored, more often than not - they found it hard to concentrate, but they didn't know the reason and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or fascinating task, interruption can be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Gvelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, by looking at the flow of products on the conveyor in search of marriage, diversionary music can help avoid boredom."
It's believed that when people start swinging on a chair or drawing doodles on a piece of paper, they do so out of boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions simply help not to relax physically.
“The study has shown that children who are not prohibited from twirling and twirling learn better and remember more information than children who are asked to sit still,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we're all bored with the delayed flight (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting movie.
However, different people show different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, in order to measure such individual characteristics, researchers developed a special “breeding scale”.
Questions and assertions such as “Many of what I have to do is uniform and monotonous” or “I'm too interested in too much, so I'm running out of time” are used to measure this scale.
Using such questionnaires, researchers have found that boys miss more girls than girls, says Stephen Vodanovic, professor of psychology at the University of Western Florida, especially when there are a variety of external irritants.
In general, however, adolescents often miss each other.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment during which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with the help of a pager.
The results were as follows: 32 per cent of adolescents stated that they were bored at school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said that they were bored outside of school.
However, only 3% of parents indicated that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no record of what this kind of data would be about boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “adolescents are at the height of boredom”, mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: is boredom helpful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme ways, research shows that it can push people into absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling, or the abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovic, who has devoted more than two decades to the study of the problem.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; that's boredom," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But this brain doesn't always know what's best.
If you're bored and you channel that energy into guitar or cooking, you're gonna make yourself feel better.
However, if you watch TV, you'll only get better for a while, and soon it'll pass.
So if your child misses and you give him an iPad, he'll stop missing, but he won't learn to fight boredom on his own or in any other way manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenske.
“And such self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations,” he claims.
Your child not only learns to do things on his own, he also learns self-control at all.
I don't think boredom should be magnified in any way.
But you don't think it's bad either.
Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even without a continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it so that we need to be bored more often, and boredom is an extremely unpleasant, indescribable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get away from constant anxiety and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to the constant over-stimulation of sense organs," he says, "and when there's silence, we get lost and we don't know what to do."
It is unclear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado will be applied.
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football player and a student at a public college in the south-eastern state of Colorado, is charged with a criminal offence, which will soon be perfectly legal throughout the state: possession of a small amount of marijuana and a pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco said that one day in September, he and his friends had been in Lamar and had been driving a prairie near the Kansas border when they had been stopped by police.
After the police officer discovered marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco was subpoenaed for possession of drugs and possession of a drug device, minor offences for which a fine of $100 was due each, and a trial date was set.
“We are treated like criminals,” says Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues for weeks after the state of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, hundreds of minor court cases depend not so much on the law as on the venue.
Charges of petty marijuana-related offences are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has taken the same measure.
Police stations had already stopped charging people aged 21 and over for possession of small doses, which would be legal as soon as the law came into force within a few weeks.
However, in the more conservative Colorado districts, prosecutors have decided to deal with existing marijuana cases and continue to be prosecuted for possession of the drug.
At the same time, some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West, have voted to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops from appearing in their places.
"All this is developing so fast that I don't even know what to expect," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
Control officials in Washington State are also puzzled to scratch their heads.
They will have to establish regulations for licensing the production, processing, distribution and sale of cannabis herb, all of which must be done by 1 December 2013.
They say Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in dealing with marijuana, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
“In Colorado, a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example,” explains Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Board for the Regulation of Alcohol Products in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than make some suggestions and hope that it will work.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we might be looking at,” he says.
The Washington State Bill, named I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will leave the state in a state of uncertainty for an entire year when State licensing systems are not yet in place and the ownership of marijuana has already been legitimized.
There are still difficult technical aspects to address during this period, such as how to strike a balance between a state order for “adequate access” to licensed marijuana, with a ban on trading 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana traders in cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs”, explains Ben Livingstone, a representative of the newly established research group, the “Centre for Legalization of marijuana”.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police of Oates from Aurora sent an e-mail to his subordinates stating that the city's prosecutor's office would no longer hold persons who had reached the age of 21 accountable for possession of a small amount of marijuana and that the police would cease to accuse people of such violations “from now on”.
The Chief of Police of Oates reported that the police would monitor compliance in the city with the regulations governing the activities of marijuana growers for medical purposes and would prosecute traffickers and drug distributors.
The Well District Attorney in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, is a more rigorous approach to this issue.
Following the vote on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to prosecute the possession of marijuana, primarily to encourage users to undergo treatment.
To date, 119 individuals have been charged with possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many have been accused of other violations.
“The duty of our institution is to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission”, Mr. Bak said in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer prosecute adults for possession of a small quantity of drugs.
The District Attorney, Pete Houtzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss the charges in the already open cases of marijuana possession.
“I believe it is our direct duty to enforce the law until it is changed,” he says.
Although 55 per cent of the Colorado residents who voted supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the public and legal systems will not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of people across the state revealed the mixed attitude of local authorities to the state's marijuana experiment.
“There is a cultural barrier to this issue among district prosecutors”, explains Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing defendants for marijuana possession, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of the Law on marijuana.
"They've been chasing people for so long, they can't really accept that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana in the same way as alcohol, are destined to become a country-wide experimental field to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Legalizers and state officials are planning to expand the legalized trade, but they are also looking forward to instructions from the federal authorities, who are still planning to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offences.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give in to this issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of traffickers and patients using marijuana for medical reasons, the federal Government has in most cases authorized the sale of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Drug Bureau agents are unlikely to break into houses to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to state-controlled recreational marijuana stores that are permitted under the new law, according to Kevin A. Sabeth, former anti-drug adviser to the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the presidential elections, some local administrations had approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana shops, which could not have opened before a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the sale of marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in the position that we're giving someone a license, and then it's going to cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, city councilman.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I survived Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother went to Oxford and described it as the world's best educational institution, a modern analogue of an antiquity symposium that lays down two foundations for civilization: freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of study at the History School of the Wooster College of Oxford University in the late '80s, I packed my bags and left, which turned into the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from a shrub cup.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically harassed and intimidated.
It's not because of my rather unusual name or that I went to private school.
I was poisoned for one reason, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment, it seemed like a real barbarity and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyatt, was Margaret Thatcher's famous advisor, and I was a conservative supporter myself.
You're gonna ask me why you want to think about it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students with center-right views are subjected to the same kind of harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that accorded to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at the College College College College of Corpus Christi in Cambridge claim that they are “often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made to feel unwanted guests” because of their political views.
They wish to add an additional representative to the college ' s equal rights committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was exacerbated by a recent BBC 2 documentary on politics in the student environment, Wonderland: Young, Smart, and Right, in which conservatives were portrayed as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservatives Association of Oxford University, who rides in a Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and cane with a silver fanny.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are being made “leavers because of higher tuition fees”.
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Conservatives Association of Nottingham University, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that "in the university environment, there is a growing bias towards leftist views.
People who don't even know us think we're arrogant and with impunity the children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a 21-year-old student at the College of Corpus Christie, in which an application for enhanced protection was filed, calls such an atmosphere “uncomfortable”, and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Conservatives Association of Oxford University, says that the student club’s attitude towards right center viewers has deteriorated considerably.
“This is a threat to both the intellectual debate and the normal life of the members of the club,” she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just a minority, I was alone.
I got there in September 1986, a shy and shy 18 - year - old girl.
Oxford was feverish from hating the conservative party.
One year earlier, the university had by vote deprived former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to a reduction in the budget allocation for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the freshman's week, when the students met each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time what was ahead of me.
I didn't know that the teachers not only looked through their fingers at the harassment of conservative students, but also enjoyed participating in it.
Political issues - a strike by miners, privatization, and the Government’s opposition to sanctioning the apartheid government in South Africa - have infiltrated wooden panels of audiences.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the eighteenth-century French text into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
I had a hard time texting, I slammed myself in.
Harry Pitt was a very gallous man with a face like a cake.
"Thatterers don't teach French, or do they just lack brains?" he asked.
The other students were giggling.
There were tears in front of my eyes.
"I suggest you take some initial French lessons in your spare time, if you're not too busy turning around in society," Pitt ran.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I sat at lunch alone; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the English Department, who introduced himself as a member of the Conservatives Association of the University.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
Unfortunately, this is as follows:
Anyone suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives will be abused.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most freshman conservatives pretend they're Labour."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardlyly to be hypocritical.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work.
A freshman at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
- They're punching each other, aren't they?"
I felt like the homosexuals must have felt before the criminal prosecution was abolished in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I only have to meet like-minded people in the middle of the night?
Will I be forced to become a Labourer and hide my true beliefs?
The three years that I would have looked like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn't hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for being a foreign policy advisor to Thatcher and one of her speechwriters.
He hardly showed up in college.
He despised him for his provincialism, pettyness and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents’ home in London, seeking refuge among relatives and impartial friends in the capital.
I told my dad I hated Oxford and I explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s, all political views were adopted.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said.
- They can't do that, not in the city of sleeping spires...
Even my Communist friends have always behaved with distinction."
His wet eyes are blurred.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you quit university."
I was exhausted on a constant trip to London and my emotional defense was weak.
My friend, also a conservator, failed to withstand pressure and renounced his beliefs.
The following week, during a seminar, when another history teacher called me “enemy of the people, ” I decided to do the same.
In the shower of shame, I admitted that "my parents brainwashed me" and called them "old fools."
It wasn't long.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was meant to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Merdock.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a crybaby and a rag.
But at the age of 18, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation at an educational institution.
It is sadder that it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen Tori prime ministers, but still hides behind the undeserved reputation of the university, which values equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to glory."
"Valentino: Master of Sew", which opened this week in London, ABC is talking to Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other prominent Italian designer clients.
Somerset House, former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting the Valentino Garavani exhibit.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of "Valentino: Master of Sew", a triumphal retrospective exhibition that combines more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says, with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "Il Signora" Garavani, but it could not be written without his high-profile clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobles.
The first Hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, is full of personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima-Han to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise, from a humble tailor from the town of Voger in northern Italy to the idol of the international elita.
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with that.
"At least they don't blow their cigarette butts off your gorgeous carpet, like some beautiful pop stars do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a great host and hosts guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved coming to his chalet in Gstaad," explains Tissen's ex-wife, a close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Anyelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And despite that, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valery Mazza recalls the charismatic modeler.
One day we went to his house for dinner, it was after a fashion show in Spain Square in Rome, years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style was manifest in everything, in every detail of his apartment, in her decoration, in her food, in her music.
"For each of Valentino's guests, he made himself feel important and loved," recalls the "top model" that began working with the fashion designer in 1995 during the High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He never goes out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art," she ends.
The Paradestination of the Fountains
Haravani's life is not a story of obsession, it's a love story with full reciprocity.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been turned into a glamorous 60-metre-long podium that offers a change of roles: the visitor takes up the role of models and should defile the runway by looking at the viewers from the dreams that shine the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the suit that Monica Vitti used in Night, or the coat of wool and skin that belonged to the Empress Far Dib.
In this audience, models are glittering with names such as Sybil of Luxembourg, Gloria von Tourn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria, or Sofia Gabsburg.
Nati Abascal and Modeler, 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentino's the first love, "can't forget."
I remember him beautifully.
It was pants, a shirt, a jilt, and a jacket from the Autumn-Winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Nati Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him to the others for his womanhood, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they fit his face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and fashion lawmaker Patricia della Jovampaol d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she was dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have the age and the reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
That time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress to wear at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with a lining, a corsage in a fold and a cut without a strap.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is out of time," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her festive dresses from a modeler with "maximum caution... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a collection of memories accompanying him."
"King of Fashion"
The grand finale of the show at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the fashioner calls her sewing) to make this ivory-colored silk outfit with pearl ingrained, 12 different laces and a four and a half-metre plume.
According to journalist Suzy Menquez, the greatest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of high fashion at the end of the 20th century, "the return of clients from the highest world."
Inspired by the elite's "style of life" for many years, Valentino is now her best representative.
The Grand Cross Cavalier (mark of the highest rank in Italy), the Cavalier of Labour, the Commander of the Order of Arts and Verbals, awarded by the Order of Honor of the Legion, Garavani collected as many honors as any of his clients' spouses.
"Always my attention was drawn to his sophistication, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance," recalls Dr.
Last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Ors Museum.
He sat at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"He was perfect, time doesn't exist for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The hardest job in the world: the Kawah-Igen miners
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano along steep rocky trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living from sulphur mining in the Kawah Ijen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfur gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes in contact with the air.
Large pieces of sulfur, which can weigh as much as 70 kg, are placed in two bamboo baskets, put baskets on their shoulders, and carry them up on a broken rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, which is 2,386 metres high, only 250 metres are needed, but it takes more than 40 minutes for worn-out movers to rise up with a turtle’s foot, struggling to maintain balance and carefully push the road so that they do not fall off or fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong move could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell off the rocks of Cawah-Igen a few years ago.
The Kawah-Igen mine earns 5 Euro cents per kilogram of sulfur produced
Once they're up there, they lay a road between tourists who take pictures of them as if they were circus monkeys and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometres to the scales that the mining company placed just above, at an altitude of 1.850 metres.
This is PT Kandi Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has operated this volcano since 1960 and, better or less, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 Euro cents) to petrochemicals, since this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even sugar bleaching.
“As the norm is to carry 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per walk”, Anto explains, who usually carries three daily hauls.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate Rs. 138.000 (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a miser for such a inhuman effort, it's three times what he'd make in the field.
“The daily wages paid to miners are very high by local standards, with a coffee charge of Rs. 15,000 (Euro1.2) per day and an average monthly wage of Rs. 2 million (Euro167),” explains a loader who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
His salary there was Rs. 75,000 (Euro6.2) per day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a valid reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as sulphur: “I married a girl from Bali, where only Hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam”.
Anto's asthma, he's barely breathing, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are tearing because of the toxic gases.
At his 27th birthday, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah Igen, which had already begun to be sulfurized despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He's got asthma, he's barely breathing, he's coughing all the time, and he's got eyes weeping because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
It's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punctuated by life, this nice and smart young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter, or a hotel clerk, but instead, he's doing mule work.
A dirty wooden cabin with other porters gets up every day at 2:00 a.m. because sulphur does not stop flowing at night when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glitters in the darkness.
By challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, lighting his way with a small flashlight connected to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
About 400 porters are hauling baskets of gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano.
Despite the high profits, the mining company did not mechanize sulphur production to save costs, nor does it provide any equipment to porters who work on their own account and with such deprivation.
In fact, they do not receive even part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) charge for photography, which, together with the entry ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), guards of the reserve charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mule people.
"This work is for cattle, not for people," says Badrusin, a native porter 42 years ago, who spent three decades in Kawah-Igen since leaving college.
Capable of raising to 110 kilos, he assures that he will tolerate work “as long as he can” because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns its throat and burns its eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so resilient that no one complains about their serious illnesses... more serious, obviously than their usual breathing problems, arthrose, knee pains and shoulder ulcer, which have been deformed under the weight of the basket.
By balancing the basket on the back, Unanik can only raise 50 kilos in his 53s.
Each day, he and his companions carry 15 tons of sulphur out of the volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamansari, crossing a narrow trail of 18 kilometres across the bushes.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unanik, wide-opening a mouth that lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30 years old, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest jobs in the world: what human mules from Kawah Igen do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy.
Singaporeans blame the career, stress and prices of housing and education for the absence of children.
"The Singaporean population needs to grow."
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my wife's patriot, we'll do our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem improbable that these lines are part of the promotion of mints, but despite this – or perhaps because of this – this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local proverbs like "Let's put the bao in the oven" to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, cherishes the hope that through advertising, they will be able to draw attention to the issue in an entertaining way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do their "national duty."
This thing is just for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
That's the main problem in the country.
We're the world's worst reproducing people like ourselves, so we felt that this was the subject that we had to address.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, for example, to launch perfumes with pheromones or to organize fast dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing that we can do to solve this problem, which is to make a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take this lightly are the Government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on politics to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax relief.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city state in South-East Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and its strict social control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Authority, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what's known as the substitution rate - in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Policy on Couples and Families of the National Population Authority, said that the reason for this was “improved education” and “a broader range of career opportunities”.
“This allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities beyond marriage and family formation,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and the postponement of marriage and childbirth, which have reduced the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policies that aim to dramatically increase immigration in order to counter population declines are a source of outrage among the local population.
Singapore has websites where barely hidden xenophobia is rife against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who have been criticized for maintaining low wages and refusing to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that last year the ruling party of Singapore won the worst election since independence.
After the elections, an attempt was made to resolve the problem through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in fertility has a known impact on the nation ' s economic growth, tax revenues, medical expenditure and immigration policies, Singapore ' s example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making efforts not to build so many small dwellings.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Manual has shifted to controlling the number of small apartments known as a “shoe box” that can be built in certain parts of the city.
These 46-square-metre apartments are sold very well.
However, it is believed that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yoo Sun, CEO of EL Developers, says that their shoe boxes are sold much faster than their larger copies.
They're more popular, in the sense that these apartments buy out for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger ones.
As a result, our cash flow is increasing.
However, he acknowledges that the new regulations provide clearer guidance to developers who had previously been obstructed if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
It's too heavy.
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to the Singaporeans who work in the center’s financial quarter, they do not seem to have much effect.
“People are overstretched, housing is expensive, as is education, and many people are putting it off,” says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it is important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man of 20 years.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and prices of housing and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to encourage its citizens to give birth to their children, as far as childbearing is concerned, the last word is left to the Singaporeans.
Personal on-line - personal on-line
Confidentiality.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, this is the characteristic of private or “the sphere of private life which is entitled to protect against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers involved in discussing situations on the Internet that would certainly not be shared outside the Internet?
ElPeríódico interviewed five children between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine" in a personal way, and "sail and user name" when they applied it to social media.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't put on the post," says the ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain personal meaning on websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had records for two years.
"It's very secretive, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he says.
On the FB, I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I'm also having fun with people I know.
"I wouldn't share a photograph that's not mine or someone who's being stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish obscene photographs of naked people, crimes, or to make offensive or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
Mother knows she has a password to one of the records.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just uploading them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends fast," he says.
Without thinking, he says he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't count on someone to recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter admits that he does not know the 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one trusted him or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I get pressured or demanded, I'll just delete them from my account," he admits.
José became an Ask follower after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what today is known as cybermobbling.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and extorted money.
"He never found out who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not delete the account.
"Only included confidentiality."
It then explains the sequence of steps for setting the account in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would download photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I would if I didn't like a man or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cybermobbling," he says.
Key issues
Marjelos Porras, an English teacher and education and training specialist, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a search engine, but with the advent of these sites the rules of the game have changed,” she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prensky, a teacher at Yale University and author of the work, Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are they, children and young people born in the age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning," she says.
It explains that the topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken at an age when maturity is insufficient to do so”.
"Also to be selective, while it is more important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what confidentiality is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do so is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are some things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you like it if they published a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you sign pictures from parties, do you ask permission from other people to celebrate them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to behave online the way they do offline.
The rules are the same.
“Besides the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, as well as social media,” she claims.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a professor of primary education and an education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social media policies in good faith.
By understanding each point, they have good reason to talk to children about the prerequisites for opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he says.
According to Gourdia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR summit ends without the Lima Declaration
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, which was announced earlier and theoretically signed by seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access a document signed at the VIth ordinary assembly of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office of the President and the Office of the President indicated on the front page that it would be handed over after closure, but confirmed that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
Questions about the text, they pointed out that the contents had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Umala, during brief press statements.
Journalists ' access to information on the Summit has always been limited.
During the day, it was only broadcast, in the press room, a video of the President's Assembly without a sound, with the message “closed meeting, no sound”.
Some of the information that has been distributed to reporters has been conveyed by UNASUR government spokespersons who were present at the meeting, but not from Peru.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused dissatisfaction among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian President's administration sent an e-mail to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but this is the Umala statement, not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and that time, despite the insistence of the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was also not disseminated.
The ASPA official website can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had made efforts to ensure that all journalists were provided with transmission systems, but that information was as limited as possible.
The Summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt a verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, gathered at a regional meeting and ratified that they will abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will begin hearing the statements of both parties on Monday in The Hague, in the context of the accusation that Lima has made against Santiago.
“We will respect and implement a decision that will explain the differences that we are now presenting to this international court”, Umala said, next to his Chilean colleague.
“Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and international tribunals”, added Piñera, and welcomed the shaking of Umala's hand against the flags of those two countries.
The two Presidents' confirmation that they would be subject to the International Court of Justice came immediately after Colombia protested this week the Pact of Bogotá, according to which it recognized submission to the verdicts of the International Court of Justice following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua, which it considered to be erroneous.
The Summit took place in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roussef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR had been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The incoming President, Ollanta Umala, was responsible for opening discussions in the morning and closing the summit, just after noon in Lima time.
The Head of State read the outcome document, in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects had been approved among South American countries, with an estimated investment of $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries would take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding residence agreements”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “co-operation in the fight against citizen insecurity and organized transnational crime, actions to increase access to medicines, low-cost Internet access in all parts of South America and to take into account the combined and effective risks of natural disasters”.
Since Europe is in crisis, “the economic union (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to broaden our production base and anticipate a better future for our cities”, Umala added.
“We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South America, especially in the village and border zones... unifying our countries and forming new economic schemes,” said the Peruvian President in a read-out.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five related to Peru and were limited to cross-axis on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two aimed at a greater link with Ecuador, but he did not provide any more details.
The outcome document also addressed the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations, from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united and to have good relations among neighbours, was another theme emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before attending the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful manner the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the international court challenged by Bogotá.
"The day after tomorrow (Saturday), perhaps I'll meet President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
“Let us reconsider all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua”, he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we can handle this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico City on Saturday, where they will have a new President, Enrique Peña Nieto, present at the inauguration.
Also within the framework of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc met in advance for the adoption of the 2013 Action Plan, which is aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay constitute UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America should learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship”: Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which “South America, in this case, should learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, stated to Peruvian State television that Europeans “killed each other during the Second World War” and in other clashes, “but now they are almost one homeland”.
He defended, in this context, the South American citizenship project, which the UNASUR participating countries endorse.
“It is necessary to ensure the free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactional sectors that want to bring us back to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian President has also shown his support for the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the assumption that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States will be reduced and that those who have signed the San José Pact on Human Rights will be taken into account.
Those who lecture never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is unexplained that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington, D.C., and is funded by the United States”, he said, referring to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assanjo.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles with him, but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that “there were some suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed”.
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding to come to his territory for interrogation concerning an alleged sexual offence, while “the Swedish law itself considers it possible to implement it by videoconference, which could be made from the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Correa confirmed that there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
“I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a slight pulmonary problem, nothing serious,” said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
What's real is the risk of his physical and mental health being impaired by being confined in a small space without being able to exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any human being," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution to the problem of asylum granted to Assanjo since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London by providing a security guarantee that would allow him to travel to Ecuador was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate on human rights; we do not use that word here, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assanj's lawyer, Baltasar Garzón, is conducting a number of trials in various European jurisdictions”, he mentioned.
And he said, "If Britain gives a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it's over."
If Sweden, as well as its legislation, and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks him for Skype, the problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to act as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not tolerate “mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression”.
“The main enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupt politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this regard, he was pleased that no one in the country, “no bankers, no bourgeois hegemonic countries, dominates Ecuador” and added that, having been re-elected, “will deepen the revolution in order to continue development in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to retain Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the guise of legality”, because in fact “it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy”.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President considered that his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos wished to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
This decision is not being respected at this time.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
We need to work them together to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed the hope that the maritime boundary dispute before the same court between Peru and Chile would be resolved well and stated that “it is right for Latin America to have recourse to international bodies if the two countries undertake to take a decision, however heavy it may be”.
Regarding the opportunity to stand as a candidate for the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to run for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he was considering this possibility “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult”.
Correa has assured that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unjust situations such as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be redressed by political power.
"My political movement felt that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I had to accept that responsibility," he said.
If we were to win, it would be my last term as president, and then we'd be out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"It's a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also referred to the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment that had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean that President Chávez's state of health is deteriorating," he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima in the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS mortality today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS test had been positive.
"I've been stunned," he recalls, despite all the doctor's tact, the moment.
The boy hid it from his family.
Having decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were justified - he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the “oldest” patients of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) HIV hospital, where he entered in 1994, and has overcome many obstacles.
He's been diagnosed with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, and in the early 1990s it would be hard to believe that there were too few treatment options, too little knowledge of the disease, too much prejudice towards the sick.
So even the director of the clinic at the Mexican Social Security Institute didn't want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, it was a sentence to have AIDS in those days.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so without compromising the quality of life.
Yet, unaware of their illness, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, “destroyed” their immune system and suffer from opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the greatest achievement to date is that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same”, pointed out the head of HCHG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectionist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva, explained that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a sentence, but that life expectancy and quality of life depended on the degree of immune system failure that patients had at the beginning of their diagnosis, with better life expectancy for those who did not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 was reported.
Simply put, the above means that a person who is diagnosed with HIV positive at 25 years of age, according to these terms, “maintaining control will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age”, he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be recalled that Mexicans now have an average life expectancy of 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has declined from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been recorded by May this year; however, it is claimed that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why is there still a death toll?
Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I picture it, that's how things are at our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we haven't had a shortage of medication, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He cited devastating data: “Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some sort of opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to perform diagnostics at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide mass detection samples for all people who request it.”
The proposal agreed with the experts and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a private laboratory for inspection, motivated only by the fact that his friend had done it and, despite his young age, he had already been in the AIDS phase and even suffered from Kaposha sarcoma, a cancer that was a common complication.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know.
"If I die anyway, I'd rather get drunk three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercise, take medication.
To date, his parents only know that he's had cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I work, I do a lot of work, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I care about myself and another person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage his statement to those who now fear in the context of World AIDS Day.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, that's better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
His presentation summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, believes that there is a great gap between health programmes and a common citizen who has taken up the issue of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, “the distribution of condoms has actually increased, we've been given one or two before, and now we're given 100 bags, and that's very good, but it turns out that there are those who still don't have access to the condom”, he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want them?" is a popular question, with escapism and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health workers who don't want teenagers to hear, assured the promoter.
I suggest that we change this inefficient distribution; that condoms be not just behind counters and that hundreds of them be in machine guns in public toilets in places frequented by young people.
It's not about encouraging promiscuity.
It was not a question of paying for beer and a motel, and Governor Emilio Gonzalez responded when asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
A total of 13.435 cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV cases) have been registered.
The state ranks fourth in the national ranking for new and total AIDS cases and thirteenth in HIV cases.
92% of the infections are in the course of sex, 6% through blood, and 2% through the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV because there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know about it in one reported case.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that would annul the restructuring of the Vitro Group ' s debt through competition in Mexico, the scenario sets a fateful precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in a neighbouring country that has problems with capacity to pay.
It seems that procedures to support the survival of firms, which are permitted by Mexican law, are not valid in the country, in contradiction with international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of the ruling handed down on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale in the bankruptcy court of the northern Texas County leaves Mexican firms vulnerable to the possibility of seizing their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
The ruling, however, opens the doors to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico for recourse to the United States Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies as evidence.
As an introduction, while the judge notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings relate to the competition proceedings before Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, for that purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law had been created, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict states that without an inter-firm vote, the critical mass of the competitive debt that Vitro subsidiaries had with the parent company would not have reached the majority necessary to approve restructuring.
Nevertheless, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whose inter-firm debt was guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Proceedings.
It is also true that by subtracting the votes of subsidiaries, Vitro creditors who fought against him in United States courts, namely vulture funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Eliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
A vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
This data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation she has faced since 2008, which has been affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States has faced by attacking the country.
For the time being, Gonzalez Sad's family firm will be filing an appeal to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote can reach its plenary, that is, five judges, because only three judges voted.
In the event of failure, a motion for certification would be submitted, which would require a review by the highest court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Government of Mexico as amicus curiae (“another court”) describing the process that Vitro follows under the Competition Act, indicating that it exempts itself from the agreements signed by both countries to link it to article 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, i.e., the rules established for cases of intergovernmental insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Karambol from two sides: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Total balance
In view of the several-month-delayed complaints placed on the table by Mexicana de Aviación against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of being a fraud, the Union Association of Air Pilots has already discovered a bottled throat.
Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic concerning an operation carried out by an entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund F/589 of Bank IXE 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexican Airlines.
Resources would be used to purchase shares of the Hotel Professional Manager Company.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
Round the Dragon Mart
A group of local and foreign ecologists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society, gathered at the Caribbean University for the weekend, approved the creation of a broad front to counter the discovery of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We're talking, as you know, about a giant mall for the sale and distribution to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for 150 companies.
Canacintra had previously succeeded in bringing together the governors of the south-eastern zone to confront the monumental forces, which had razed parts of the protected areas and posed serious threats against the industry.
Death of ACTA
Regarding the Government ' s rejection of the Senate ' s request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Trade Agreement on Counterfeiting, known as the acronym in English ACCTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already been filed.
As you know, the action has been carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself has disqualified it from being seen as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term housing developers, Homex places 500 million pesos worth of market certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical ones, with a proposal to pay interest every 28 days.
Competival appears
Founded by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, information technology leaders, a consortium with the trade name Competival has just come to life, its goal will be the market for software clusters in Central and South America.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
Hector "Hetin" Reyes, a long-time basketball explorer, has been involved in this sport for more than 60 years and, as a result, has travelled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And before the brain hemorrhaging confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was put into sports for more than 60 years, as a small player, a player in the Supreme Basketball League, an official and head of the BSN with the Bahiamon Cowboys and the President of the Basketball Federation.
"I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as when I was president of BSN, director general of the National Team and president of the Federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during Primera Hora's visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate by making that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things collected over his long journey, bear witness to this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotion, he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old as a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, "which I enjoyed most, "because I've had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy championships since 1967, "as an agent, co-agent, or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minsey's BSN debut.
From that moment on, Kuco Ortiz, who was the great administrator, continued to lead, as Reyes pointed out.
I remember that Gene Bartov, who was on his way here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong 6'7 player for you."
"Do you want to?"
And that was the beginning of Minsey, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who acquired citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsie had brought Bayamon's championship, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy Championship with Gauss, but I was already at a distance, because by 1988 I was the chief of the Federation.
By then, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and those of Minsey in the national team.
I remember the first time we won from the U.S. during an Olympic qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we won fourth place, and it was supposed to be bronze, if it weren't for the Canadian judge who forced us to replay the final game, Reyes said.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She's among the best, just like the one who won Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one with the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and defeated the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won our bronze at the World Cup.
Not only did Mincy, Gauss, Ramón Rivas, Fico López and 'Piculina' (Ortisa) play that team again, but also young (Havier) 'Tonito' Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who was unable to compete in 1990 due to knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but which brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualification Tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like Canito Nieves, Pablo Alicea, and young Rolando Hurruitner to replace the players temporarily suspended for disorder in the Pan American Mar del Plata Championship, we won gold against all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performance at the international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as Piculin did.
And that doesn't take into account his career in the various leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Young, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your biggest achievement in the Federation?
In the early 1990s, there were 17 teams in the BSN season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to do, like regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, the Ponce boys play only in their own field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and it's unnecessary.
At the very least, I see the fruits of mandatory certification and a course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
I listen most to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who's always been with me.
The actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his leading role as John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the Dallas television series, in which he represented a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as an oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallasa season, died on Friday night of cancer-related complications, according to a family statement for The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas studio.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing once again the landmark role he liked most," his family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him at the Thanksgiving fair in Dallas.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and sequel, was next to Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, said her representative Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, gentle and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original and lived a full life," confirmed Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and was transplanted.
Long before "Dallasa", Hagman became famous on television because of his role in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive gin girl played by Barbara Eden, and starts living under the same roof with her.
He was also the main character of two comedys that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included roles well-recognized by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his workshop interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of fame.
CBS's drama series on the Ewing clan and other characters in his entourage aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan, "Who shot J.R.?", designed to make noise around an episode full of emotions in which the character Hagman was almost killed, generated international debate and millions of dollars at risk in bookstores.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the show that time.
When the November 1980 episode answered, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned "Dallas" into the second-largest entertainment program in history, following the 1983 "MASH" final, which attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (in the performance of Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. interrupted her and then threatened her that he would accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: an dishonest businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be treated.
"I know what's supposed to be on J.R." Hagman said in 1988.
It's supposed to say, "There's an honest citizen here, J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Prinsipal, also the hero of the original show, remembered on Friday Hagman as someone "large on and off the screen."
He is unforgettable and indispensable to millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of a new issue of "Dallas" were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
Five episodes of the second season had already been completed and the sixth was in production, and the channel reported.
Warner or TNT have yet to announce what will happen to the show after Hagman's departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who blistered in classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried to be happy in the theaters of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist, May Axelsson, and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities lived.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tal (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything in there that I thought was capable of hurting anyone or influencing them in any way," he said, "Prenza Asociada at the time.
After the liver transplant, he promoted organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients with fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they're in surgery, and after," he pointed out in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "don't be afraid, it'll be a little awkward for a little while, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course that explores "The end of the world" begins.
Every week students study apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when Professor Stewart Sharma decided to read the course about the end of the world, he knew that he had the irresistible bait: the end of the Mayan “long reverse” calendar, on 21 December, which many people had grasped as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what he would expect in the next couple of months: the catastrophic storm Sandy, the financial crisis that some call the longaarmageddon, and the growing conflict that Israel is entangled in, a place where Christian late-time theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharma this week to students at Rutgers Camden University, New Jersey.
If you look at what's going on in the world today, as if we only had 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember what's bad for those with apocalyptic thinking.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the end of the world this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Associate Professor Barry Walker is giving a course on media, culture and the end of the world.
Every week students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're analyzing why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way that hypothetical scenarios are offered that give rise to certain human actions.
If nuclear material were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell the students what was probably plausible and impossible," Walker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Matthew Restall, Professor of Latin American History, and his colleague Amara Solari, Associate Professor of Art and Anthropology, joined together to read a course called “The End of the World”.
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again in case the world doesn't end," he said.
Despite “necessary destruction”, students must study, prepare projects and take final examinations.
At Penn State, the final exam will be accepted on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work "until the night when the world is expected to end", says Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"The place ended in two hours," he said about his high-middle-scoring course for 35 students.
We received e-mails for weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked if there were more places.
Students, in turn, assure us that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Vekes, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he was watching all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that would teach it," he said.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone the professor, said that they believed in the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project touched upon the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the University of Temple from West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, says Restall.
But he pointed out that there is an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which spans centuries, where people react to changes around themselves by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other places, people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in an English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course on the end of the world there.
“The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world”, he wrote, implying a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the last trial had been spoken of for a long time, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, “people would immediately start thinking about the next date” or that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are careless about this date.
Some say they're going to end of the world parties.
"Maybe I'll call one of my friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
