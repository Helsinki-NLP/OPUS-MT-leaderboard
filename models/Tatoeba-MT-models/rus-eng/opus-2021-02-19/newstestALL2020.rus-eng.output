But first of all, I think we should add to the one-man component.
I think we have a problem with that.

The violation is subject to administrative liability.
The Kremlin is positive about any decisions that help save human lives.
"We know how many fires there are, many of them have very tragic consequences and social resonance.
Therefore, any life saved justifies such decisions.” Peskov reported.
First of all, the press secretary views it as a fire measure, not a way to protect the neighbors from tobacco smoke.
Peskov also noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not welcome smoking and is a supporter of a healthy lifestyle.

China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the Taipei Bill.
China strongly opposes the adoption by the US of the so-called Taipei Bill, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of the three China-United States joint communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by Ma Xiaoguang, official representative of the Office of the Chinese Council of State for Taiwan Affairs.
The approval of the bill by the United States Senate Committee on International Relations is also a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations and gross interference in China's internal affairs, as noted by Ma Xiaoguang.
Taiwan, he said, was part of China and related matters related to China ' s internal affairs.
“We call on the American side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the relevant negative legislation, and immediately stop interfering with the Taiwan question in order to avoid further damage to Chinese-American relations as well as to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait”, he noted.
China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone and no forces, as Ma Xiaoguang stressed.
TikTok hides inappropriate videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under 18 years of age
Imagine China / Reuters
China’s TikTok social network censors videos that refer to Tiananmen Square, Tibet’s independence, or the banned Falun Gong religious group, tells The Guardian.
The documents at the disposal of the publication show that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) promotes China's foreign policy objectives abroad through the application.
Most of the violations related to China's policy fall under the category of “hate incitement”.
In each case, TikTok places unfavorable publications in a context appropriate to the general rules, so that the actions of the social network do not appear to be censorship.
For example, the prohibition of criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general prohibition of “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “distortion of the history of China or other countries”.
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of twenty “foreign leaders or statesmen”, including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politics Mahatmu Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Kyung-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Premier Narendra Modi, as listed in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by social media administrators and may result in user blocking.
Not too severe is the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are out of date and no longer applied: "We now use a localized approach to modernize, as well as independent local professionals."
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on their publications, as reported by the co-founder of the Production Centre, Rustum Bogdanov.
"Producer's Center" is one Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the bloggers' promotional material "Producer Center" is coordinated with the social media, but the user's material can be posted without agreement, and it's passed on to the Bogdans.
When asked whether TikTok could speak of politics or Putin, Bogdanov answered in the affirmative and said that he had seen such publications.
The founder of Our Digital Roman Zaripov agrees with Bogdanov: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you cannot post shocking content that discriminates against words and so on."
But under these rules, any content that the moderators don't like is celebrated by Zaripov.
The Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under 18 years of age.
According to the user agreement, only persons over the age of 13 can use TikTok.
Social network administrators test their age with artificial intelligence: neurosete analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, tells the Bogdans.
If neurosed decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to the BCF, byteDance opened an office in Moscow in September 2019 in the WeWork Quarking Territory.
Istanbul residents spoke about the earthquake in the city
A severe earthquake caused panic in Turkey's largest city
Last Thursday, 26 September, an earthquake of 5.9 magnitude struck Istanbul.
Thirty-four people were injured, 10 of whom are still in hospitals.
A resident of Istanbul, Melique, admitted to having a panic attack for the first time in her life.
"I cried so much.
She was crying right at work.
Then it got easier, so I went back to business.
"But I'm so ashamed now!" said the girl to Channel 360.
"In Istanbul, there was a really powerful earthquake.
I can't come back yet!
But generally, I'm fine." I shared my impressions with political scientist Jaylan Ozgül.
Project manager Celine noted that the mayor kept all the residents informed, but according to her, citizens still feel small shocks of about 3.2 or 3.5.
She also drew attention to the problem of communications in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake.
The girl said she couldn't reach her mother, but the Internet was working great and she was able to send a message through WhatsApp.
As kp.ru wrote, after the earthquake, all kindergartens and schools were closed, from which all students were evacuated.
Four hundred and seventy-three buildings were damaged.
The epicenter of powerful underground shocks was recorded 68 kilometres west of Istanbul, in the Marmara Sea.

The audit found that there were irregularities in the timeliness and correctness of the diagnosis, as well as in the standard and level of assistance provided.
Verification materials have been transferred to the UKSC by region.
Previously, URA.RU reported the arrest of the head of the Southralsk Hill Hospital.
The Russians have warned of false calls from banks.
In Russia, there has been an increase in calls from fraudsters who replace the bank's phone number.
This is reported by Commersant with reference to the Central Bank's data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator handed over to the telecommunications operators more than 2,500 numbers from which the clients of various financial organizations had called.
In 189 cases, the operators found a replacement number.
A further 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases there was a restriction on the use of financial services.
Artem Sychev, the deputy head of the information security department of the Central Bank, said that a wide range of Russian banks had been involved in changing the number.
He explained that operators did not always respond to Central Bank warnings of fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such a duty in the Communications Act.
The Open Bank, Rosbanke and Alpha Bank confirmed an increase in fraudulent calls to switch numbers.
According to the Bilaina Press Service, some of the information on fraudulent calls that the Central Bank provided was incorrect: the lists contained numbers that were actually used by banks to communicate with clients.
Their blocking would cause disruptions to the organization.
Artem Sychev told me that the Central Bank is planning to create a fraud database to which the communications operator will call on every call to check the number.
He explained that such a framework would require legislative amendments.

In September, Roscomnadzor discovered political advertising in Google, Facebook and YouTube.
According to the agency, this occurred during the Russian elections of 8 September.
The facts of the violations were referred to the State Committee.

Stoltenberg discussed with the green entry of Ukraine into NATO
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenski discussed Ukraine's membership in the alliance on the margins of the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly.
That's what Gensek told me when he spoke at Columbia University in New York.
In response to a question as to whether the topic had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they had indeed discussed the issue and stressed that Ukraine had not indicated in its reply a date for its accession to NATO.
He said that any country that wished to join the North Atlantic Alliance had to meet certain conditions in order to meet specific standards, wrote RT.
In Crimea, the Green alternative to the NATO course was proposed.
The President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelensky, should instead pursue a policy of joining NATO to establish good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
On Friday, 27 September, the Co-President of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Cegrinets, reported on this.
"The President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but should heed the advice of Donald Trump, who listened to his sour face, and establish a relationship with the President of Russia," said the Čegrinz to the journalists of RIA Novosti.
The Čegrinz noted that Zelensky was a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian President would be able to remain in power only if relations with the Russian Federation were established.
Earlier on September 27, NATO General Section Jens Stoltenberg reported that he had had a conversation with Zelensky on the country's entry into the alliance.
In order to do so, he said, Ukraine had to meet certain conditions.
On 5 June, the deputy welcomed Evgeny Balikki, who said that the possible integration of Ukraine into the alliance would not guarantee a better life in the country.
Money is more important than football.
Barcelona is blackmailing Naymar.
The Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer, Neimar, are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the attacker's transfer to French Paris St. Germain.
It almost got to trial, but the Catalans asked the player to settle the dispute without the intervention of Femida.
Otherwise, they refuse to return to him.
Naymar and his clever father, who is also a Brazilian agent, have made an interesting trick: under an agreement with Barsa, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward ended up in the "FGW" for a record 222 million euros.
Nevertheless, he received $22 million from the Catalan and now wants the remaining 18.
In addition, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payment.
When Neumar's claims became known in the capital city of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
Blue Granate insists that the bonus was paid for the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was entitled to only a quarter of the 40 million euros and is required to pay back the proportionate part of the first payment.
But the interesting thing is that in the summer, Naimar and Barsa almost agreed to bring back a bad player in Catalonia.
True, the deal failed, but there's still hope for a forward shift.
Now, according to Sports.Ru, referring to insiders, the club’s lawyers told the player’s representatives that if the issue of financial claims was not resolved in a pre-trial manner, it would prevent the Brazilian from returning.
Naymar himself is so eager to return that he asked for assurances that the Catalan would buy him back.
March Laar: Members of EKRE will not join the Board of the Bank of Estonia
EKRE members have not been and will not be invited to the council.
The Board of the Bank of Estonia draws conclusions about the confidence of the Estonian State.
As long as the EKRE members maintain behavior that they say at first and then think none of them will be invited to the bank board.
“The chairman of the Board of the Bank of Estonia cannot apologize for the statements made by the Board members,” Laar said in an interview with Delfi, transmitting the ERR broadcast portal.
However, Laar noted that EKRE was represented at the Eesti Pank Board.
The current seventh board of the Bank of Estonia comprises, in addition to Laar, Liina Tjnisson, Kaye Kerem, Urmas Varblane, Kalev Kallo, Janus Tamkivi (Reform Party), Ann Lystra and Rein Minka.
At the suggestion of Laar, two councillors, Kallo and Tjunisson, are to be replaced by the latter, with Anne Esmaa (Centralist Party) and Ivari Padara (Social Democratic Party).
At the same time, the Reform Party wanted to replace Janus Tamkivi with Andrés Sutty.
But Laar replied that the goal of the Reform Party was to get two seats on the board of the Bank of Estonia - that the board should include Andrés Sutt, in addition to Janus Tamkivi.
On Tuesday, 24 September, the Riigikogu rejected Laar's proposal to appoint new members of the Board of the Bank of Estonia.
In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Federation commented on a scandal in Kyrgyzstan from the Malakhov show.
In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian Federation commented on the outrage caused in Kyrgyzstan by the next issue of Andrei Malakhov's programme, "Prime air", transmitting RIA News.

In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic, the moderator had made incorrect remarks about the situation of Kyrgyz citizen Islambek Akbarov, who had been involved in an accident in which Russian Alexander Marugov had died.
Malakhov said that a citizen of Kyrgyzstan could have engineered an accident.
The accident occurred on 8 July in Moscow.
Marugov ran into a motorcycle in a taxi run by the Akbars.
According to preliminary data, the taxi driver was responsible for the accident.
Malakhov himself, who was asked to apologize to the citizens of Kyrgyzstan, said that those words were simply a personal opinion.
As explained in the Russian Department, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kyrgyzstan did not call Russian diplomats - there was a scheduled working visit during which, among other things, the speaker ' s remarks were discussed.
“Andrei Malakhov’s point of view is the journalist’s opinion, his personal view of the situation,” said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that the incident would not affect the relations between the Russian Federation and Kyrgyzstan.

How to increase future pension and not recycle
It is able to pay not only the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, but also non-State pension funds.
NPF is a private company, reports Volgograd Truth.
They work as a contribution: you make contributions, the foundation invests them, and over time returns money to you with interest.

Public service employees, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked a certain number of years in the regions of the Far North receive increased pension payments.
In order not to refuse at retirement age, take care of this in advance.
Buy real estate, currency, securities, deposit money.
The most important thing is to constantly improve your financial literacy.

According to Telegram Channel RT, journalists were there in special protective suits for less than five minutes, as the ruins of the destroyed power plant still drained 40,000 times the norm.
The accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant took place on the night of 26 April 1986.
Twelve regions in Ukraine and 23 per cent of the area of Belarus have been exposed to radiation contamination.
Nineteen regions were affected in Russia.
Let us recall that in July this year, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree according to which a green corridor open to tourists has emerged in the Chernobyl zone.
A ban on filming has also been lifted in the exclusion zone.
It was previously reported that the Chernobyl exclusion zone on the Belarusian side had been opened to tourists.
Tour organizers stressed that less radiation could be obtained in the zone in a day than it was during flight by plane.
Tarasov repeated Ibrahimovich's trick.
A former midfielder of the Moscow Locomotive took part in a shuttle that launched the Swedish forward of the Los Angeles Galaxy, Zlatan Ibrahimovich.
Tarasov's trick was featured in his Instagram.
Afterwards, Tarasov called Havbeks of the "railcars" Alexey and Anton Miranchuk, rap artist T-Killah, as well as bloggers from YouTube channel 2DROTS.
The Swedish has published a video with a hashtag #matrixchallenge, which holds the ball on its chest, leaning back, and moves its arms like the main character of the film "Matrix" Neo, who in one scene has similarly avoided bullets flying into it.
Ibrahimovich suggested that the havbek "Manchester United" Paul Pogba, tennis player Novak Jokovic, Russian UFC champion Habib Nurmagomedov and his agent Mino Rayola should repeat the trick, noting them on tape.
It was previously reported that the wife of a Ukrainian footballer had participated in Ibrahimovich's chalandzh.

Last year, it was 13 per cent, reaching $5.5 billion.
In the first half of 2019, states reached $3 billion in trade, and Ziga told them.
According to the head of the Ministry of Promtorg, Denis Mantourov, in order to consolidate this positive trend, it is necessary to increase cooperation in the industrial sector.
It had previously been reported that Russian and Slovak parliamentarians were planning to carry out joint activities to promote tourism between countries, as well as cooperation in the areas of health and education.

Which club will take the paroled Pavel Mamayev
The football player Pavel Mamayev, released from parole last week, is not going back to Reddar Football Club.
The club's former quarterback may shortly sign a contract with the Rostov FC, reporting on the Championate portal.
According to the publication, negotiations between Rostov and Mamayev are now in their final stages.
The contract with a 31-year-old footballer is expected to be signed for two years, with the possibility of an extension for another season.
Sport-Express writes that Pavel Mamayev was due to undergo a medical examination in Moscow's Dynamo the day before, but that the examination was not due to the "uncertain situation at the club".
Krasnodar terminated his contract with Mamayev last week on the agreement of the parties.
The quarterback has been playing for the Red-Dar club since 2014.
With the team, he won twice the bronze of the Russian championship.
Previously, Mamaev had been a supporter of the Moscow "Torpedo" and CSKA.
From 2009 to 2016, Mamaev played for Russia with 15 matches.
Aleksandr Kokorin Mamayev, along with Zenita player, served his sentence for fighting in the centre of Moscow last October.
In mid-September, they were released from parole.
Zenith signed a new contract with Kokorin.
A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a cart found in a garbage pile.
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after samurai swording his opponent in a dispute over a cart found in the trash.
The 54-year-old Curtis Miller dug through a pile of garbage near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers, who went out for an evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the trash.
Miller saw Beaver's find and was upset.
He thought he could claim a cart because he was the first one to dig through the trash.
The men started arguing.
All of a sudden, Beavers grabbed a cart and ran with it towards his house.
Then Miller took the sword he found in the same pile of samurai and pursued the opponent.
He caught up with Beavers at his house.
Miller took the sword out of the knife and started waving it in the direction of the cart thief.
Beavers told Miller what was going on was on video.
After seeing the video camera, Miller escaped, but threatened to return.
Beavers left a cart in the yard and went inside.
Shortly thereafter, he saw a strange woman enter his yard and take the cart, shouting insults.
The police have already been looking for Miller for driving without a license.
The man was arrested, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked an unknown woman and stabbed her with a sword.
He thus reacted that the guests at the wedding, which was celebrated in the same hotel where he stayed, did not allow him to light a cigarette.
Three-way rioting
The Moscow case against the summer protestors the further away, the more visible it falls into fragments and loses political content.
The evidence of “mass disorder” itself fails to be verified, but in the absence of a political decision to slow down the case, a weak evidentiary basis would not necessarily have led to the withdrawal of the charges.
The collapse of the case should inspire society, but it will certainly leave in extreme irritation the silos, whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disorder), Alexei Miniylo, was unexpectedly released from detention without any obligation, and a few hours later he was rehabilitated: the SCR dropped the charges against him.
Minyilo was arrested for almost two months, and he was defended by several professional associations: historians, priests, literary writers.
Since then, there have been only two accused of involvement in the riots (the original number of accused was 13): Sergei Fomin, transferred to house arrest on 3 September, and Samariddin Rajabov, who had been arrested by the court the previous day until the end of December (he was also accused of violence against an official of the authority, art. 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court sentenced the author of the mock petition for Latvia's accession to the United States.
The court of the Vidzem region of Riga sentenced the author of a ridiculous petition for Latvia's accession to the United States of America, Denis Bartetskom.
It is reported that the man was assigned 80 hours of corrective labour and one year of probation.
"The common sense is not the strongest part of our system," commented the Bartets Court's decision.
He added that punishment was usually less than requested.
The collection of signatures of Latvia's accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, at the same time as the petition, the website collected signatures on Latvia's accession to the Galactic Empire and on the country's withdrawal from the Solar System and the Milky Way.
It is noted that Bartecki has been prosecuted under the first paragraph of the 82nd article of the Criminal Law of the country, “Purpose call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia”.
Prior to that, in 2016, the author of the online petition for Latvia's accession to Russia received six months of prison.
A Japanese airliner landed in Khabarovsk on an emergency basis
Boeing, who flew from Austria to Japan, made an emergency landing at Khabarovska airport, reports TASS.
The aircraft belonging to the Japanese company ANA had 206 passengers on board, including 12 crew members.
It is noted that there are no casualties.
After the people from Tokyo, another flight took off.
According to a spokesman for the Habarov airport, the cause of the incident was a drop in the oil pressure of one of the aircraft’s engines.
It was previously reported that an aircraft flying from the Moscow airport of Zhukovski to Kyrgyzstan had landed at Samara airport on an emergency basis because of a sick child on board.
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes that police officers be punished for insults on the Internet.
The Russian Ministry of the Interior has prepared amendments to the Police Act to protect police officers from the dissemination of defamatory and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, an application for public discussion of the bill appeared on the Federal Regulatory Portal, and the draft document has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document states that it is being developed in response to the need to protect the honour and dignity of a police officer from “dissemination on information and communication networks, including on the Internet, of defamatory information, including discrediting information”.
The exact manner in which police officers are to be protected from defamation online is not specified.
However, the explanatory note to the document states that the provisions of the amendments will be applied “by individualizing the mechanism”, already pre-arranged by the law on the freezing of offices insulting the authorities and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws entered into force in March this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public debate and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the Explanatory Note, amendments to the Police Act are due to enter into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law to punish “public contempt” on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource of a violation and gives it 24 hours to eliminate it.
The first offence is punishable by a fine of between 30,000 and 300,000 roubles, and the second offence is punishable by administrative detention for up to 15 days.
On 12 April, Roscomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Japanese edition 76.ru.
Shortly thereafter, the Ugly District Court of Novgorod Oblast fined a local resident 30,000 roubles for posting “two records of improper information that offends human dignity and public morals and expresses manifest disrespect for society, the State and the authorities exercising State authority in the Russian Federation”.
Target date for the reduction of mortgage rates
Housing loans in Russia will decline until the end of 2019.
This was announced by Alexander Plutnik, the general director of the credit organization Dom.ph, and transmitted to Interfax.
As Plutnik pointed out at the Ministry's College of Russia, most banks will conduct another cycle of mortgage reduction in the remaining months of the year, and the market average will reach 8.9 per cent, the level envisaged by the national project “Housing and the Urban Environment”.
According to the project's passport, in 2019 the average mortgage rate should be 8.9 per cent, in 2021 8.5 per cent and in 2024 7.9 per cent.
The programme provides for “affordable housing for middle-income families, including the provision of acquisition opportunities (their housing with a mortgage rate of less than 8 per cent)”.
Earlier in September, it was reported that one of the largest players in the Russian mortgage market, Sberbank, was planning another reduction in housing credit rates before the end of 2019.
Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The subject of phytoandrogens has been poorly studied.
Of the most famous, pine pollen.
Phytoestrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (circulatory, some cancers).
Known sources of phytoestrogens are all beans (the most popular - soya), humbles, and linen seeds.
Many experts believe, however, that such bads cannot be a complete substitute for natural hormones.
Nor can the possible harm from such additives be excluded.
For example, when they are received, the production of hormones of their own may be reduced by the fact that there are too many external analogues in the body.
The Vertennikovs called for the revival of the Kazakh “Genice”.
Former attacker Rotor and Russian team Oleg Veretennikov joined in the revival of Kazakhstan's “Genisa”.
The club from Astana, which at various times was called "Dinamo", "Celinnik", "Astana" and "Genice", was dissolved in 2014.
The Vertensians defended its colours in 2004 and 2008.
"I found out about the Renaissance of the Genice Football Club organized by his fans.
I couldn't stay out of it!
I spent a season and a half at this club.
These were not the best times in terms of results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal fans, who have always been with the team!
I'll always remember the Munitepasov stadium where I scored my 200th ball in my career!
The Genice must be reborn!
He's got a huge story and great fans.
I wish them all the best, and I believe the city will give them back their home club!" wrote the Vertennikovs to Instagram.
The Bastion complex launched an Onyx missile on Chukotka.
The DOD launched its first cruise missile from the Bastion complex on Chukotka.
Onex was launched 350 kilometres away from the target, and 200 of them flew over land, which is a record for this type of missile.
Some 10 naval and naval vessels, as well as naval aircraft, provided security for the shooting, and reported to the Information and Mass Communications Department of the Ministry of the Russian Federation.
Previously, Bastion complexes were never used on Chukotka.
Hydrometret Center called the right people's signs.
In Russia, there's a lot of folk that people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometret Center checked all the signs that were supposed to work.
Meteorologists have come to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, but in the short term.
As the scientific director of the Hydrometre Centre of Russia, Roman Wilfand, said, if the sun is red during the sunset, then the next day will indeed be good, as our ancestors have noticed.
And if the sky shines white, the next day it'll rain.
The second workout is based on bird observation.
They say more about swallows, if they fly low, it's usually raining.
The simple explanation is that when the humidity of the air is great, the flies get wet and the feathers are forced to fall to hunt insects, writes TASS.
There are people's signs on different continents.
Groundhog Day is a traditional popular holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on 2 February.
It is believed that on this day you must observe the storm coming out of your hole to determine when spring will come.
Unidentified oil slicks were found on the beaches of north-east Brazil
Oil stains of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches in north-east Brazil.
Contamination was scattered over 2,000 kilometres of shoreline.
Early oil slicks were reported as early as 2 September.
However, their number has continued to increase every day up to Thursday, as has territorial coverage.
The Brazilian Environment Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the identified samples.
It turns out they're all identical, and it's about crude oil.
At Petrobras State Oil Corporation, which was given samples for analysis, they stated that they were not of the same composition as oil extracted from Brazilian oil fields.
"It's thick oil.
It could be dropped from one of the ships after the tanks have been cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it hit the ocean current," told the Brazilian news portal G1, the coordinator of the oil union of Pernambuco and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country, environmentalists discovered nine sea turtles covered entirely with oil film.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin to clean up contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the institute recommends that tourists and locals avoid oil spills and report any contamination found.
Medvedev commissioned a review of the standards of the catering industry
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has instructed Rospornadzor, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Promtorg, together with the business ombudsman and the business community, to review the health and epidemiological rules and standards for community-based organizations.
They will also have to study the transition to the application of the requirements of the Eurasian Economic Union regulations in food management.
The agency's proposals are due to be submitted to the Government no later than 15 October, as indicated in the list of Mr. Medvedev's instructions following the 11 September “Dialogue” programme on Russia 24.
By the same date, Mr. Medvedev had instructed all the above-mentioned agencies, in addition to the Ministry of Justice, to submit proposals for the conduct of an experiment, starting on 1 January 2020, to limit the control activities for community-based organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad oblast.
The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been instructed until 11 November to submit to the Government a bill amending the CAP to apply an administrative suspension for violation of the dietary requirements that caused the injury to health.
In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Rospornadzor and the Ministry of Finance need to consider the gradual transition from 2021 to a basket of consumers based on a basic set of products that will lead to a healthy diet.
Let's remind you that the business community spoke of outdated standards after one of the Cafés of the Anderson network was closed.
The business community demanded the abolition of the existing San Pina, and Rospetnadzor announced a joint development of new ones.
Thirty-three agencies have been listed.
In the meantime, Rospetnadzor intends to reduce the number of sanitary standards and regulations by 40 times by 2021.
The operatives now have knowledge of three thefts involving the detainee.
He was employed by a man in the Skuratov neighbourhood of Tula.
He was stealing batteries and automagnets from cars.
Of the two vehicles, VAZ-2106 and VAZ-2107, the kidnapper took the batteries, presumably for further sale.
"And from another VAZ-2107 car, the perpetrator took the vehicle magnet and the subvopher for the same purpose," reported to the Internal Affairs Department in the Tula region.
The stolen intruder probably intended to resell.
Currently, a 26-year-old unemployed person is detained.
The Russians don't have anything to save for their retirement, V. Matvienko.
The Speaker of the Federation Council, Valentin Matvienko, believes that Russians do not have sufficient savings to make the guaranteed pension product bill fully operational in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings is quite common worldwide.
It's another matter of how timely it is to introduce it.
“It seems to me that a large part of the population now has incomes, of which they have nothing to allocate to increasing pensions in the future,” said V. Matvienko.
In the speaker's view, Russians are unable to understand the mechanisms for the formation and calculation of pensions, since “the constant changes in this area have left them completely confused”.
That does not mean that I am opposed to the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we have to do everything we can to make sure that pensions, the social security of citizens, are improved.
But steps in this direction must be deliberate, responsible, responsive to domestic realities,” said V. Matvienko, "RIA News".
The head of the FP stressed that if this initiative (the guaranteed pension product bill) were to develop, several basic principles should necessarily be included, including voluntaryness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and State responsibility for safeguarding pension savings.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced that a draft law on the guaranteed pension product (SGP) would be forwarded for negotiation.
Its main elements include the exclusively voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, the guarantee of long-term pension savings by the State, the registration of citizens ' savings accounts by the central administrator, tax incentives for businesses and tax deductions for citizens.

This was revealed in Sony's press release, which states that the third part of Spider-Man with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
It was previously reported that Disney and Sony Pictures were unable to reach a consensus on income-sharing, which would cause Spider-Man to leave Kinsilized Marvel.
Sony owns the rights to a movie hero.
She rented them for the Marvel films, which belong to Disney.
As a result, Sony earned revenue from filmcassettes and Disney from souvenirs and toys.
At some point, it was reported that Disney had stopped doing so, and the company wanted to renegotiate the agreement.
The president of Marvel Studios, Kevin Faigi, said he was thrilled.
It's amazing that Spady's journey will continue in Queensian Marvel.
"All of us at Marvel Studios are very happy to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-man is a landmark figure.
It's a hero whose history affects all generations and audiences around the world," says his press release.
But Faigi reminded me that Sony is also creating his own kinosil, built around Spider-Man.
"It just so happens that he's the only superpowered hero who's found himself in different movie universes.
So as long as Sony continues to develop his own Spady Universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he noted.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, obviously commenting on the news, posted on his Instagram account a passage from "The Wolf of Wall Street," in which the hero Leonardo de Caprio shouts "I'm not leaving!"
Information on conflicts between companies appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted half the cash flow from Spider-Man movies, provided that both companies paid half the cost of producing the paintings.
But it didn't suit Sony.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved superhero from Kinsele Marvel has aroused anger among many loyal worshipers.
Details of the new conditions are not yet disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but stated: “We have cooperated well over the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many fans [of the Spider-Man].
We're glad we can move forward together."
The film "Avengers: The Final", which brought together Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the most cashier film in the history of the world, replacing the Avatar.

The blogger ran for the Verkhovna Rada for European Solidarity.
Now he's running TV on the channel Pramoi, where he's strongly critical of Russian propaganda.
In 2017, according to ICTV, Karpov was recognized as Ukraine's best blogger.

Most of the participants in the flashmob publicly support the Kremlin's aggressive policy.
Winnick became the only Ukrainian participant in the project.
The singer's press service had previously explained that the artist had participated in a project in support of the International Day of Peace, which was celebrated on 21 September, and had not changed his patriotic position.
Let's remind you, there's been a wave of outrage in the network.
The video itself is called mocking.
How can artists who have visited the occupied Crimea, who support Putin’s policy, who started the war on Donbas, where people die almost every day, talk about peace?
Four people were convicted of a series of house robberies in Khabarovsk
In Khabarovsk, the court sentenced four residents of the village of Friendship, who for two years had robbed the premises of the Cosmos and Rainbow associations in the Black River region.
On September 27, the IA reported "Habarovsk City Today."
The criminal group included previously unconvicted men of 31 and 37 years of age and two brothers of 21 and 24.
It has been established that the perpetrator of the crime is the older brother who served in juvenile colonies during his youth.
He ransacked nine houses alone, and the rest later joined.
The damage to each of the thefts ranged from 3,000 to 21,000 roubles.
The perpetrators carried ovens, refrigerators, curtains, buckets, gas cylinders, chairs, tumblers, and many other items.
They were detained thanks to a security alarm that went off in the last house.
The defendants were found guilty of thefts involving unlawful entry into the home, causing significant damage by a group of persons by prior conspiracy.
“The brothers have been sentenced to 3 years and 6 months' imprisonment in the general-regime colony, and the other two defendants to 2 years and 10 months and 1 year and 6 months' suspended imprisonment”, quotes the senior assistant prosecutor of the Khabarovsk district, Yuli Vasilieva Agency.

MMA's first rule fights, which Alexander Yemelyanenko devised, will take place in Moscow on 29 November, in an Anderkard boxing match between Yemelyanenko and Strongman Mikhail Kökläev.
The battles were lost in a display, as Yemelianko said in an interview with SE.
There's no one to look at.
So I came up with a new kind of mixed martial arts, Universal World Fight.
Rules are three different rounds.
MMA is a sport where all martial arts are gathered.
A mixed-style fighter should be able to do everything - and work in the counter, and fight, and work in the desk.
The first round is just an impact machine in the counter.
The second round is only a struggle, with a 30-second time limit for the reception.
The third round is allowed.
When's the first tournament on the rules that you came up with?
November 29th.
In the undercarriage of our fight with the Koklyaev.
But we don't know exactly how many battles we're going to have.

Trade between Russia and India can double as a result of the geopolitical situation.
The Deputy Director of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Manish Kumar, reported on this at the Fifth Commemorative Forum of Small and Medium-sized Businesses of the SCO and BRICS regions.
It is important for us to learn from the SCO and BRICS countries, including Russia, a guest from Delhi.

This is a small and medium-sized business that cooperates with the countries of the Shanghai Organization.
We are not standing on the ground, but developing, and all of these sanctions against Russia and the geopolitical situation are only helping us all to grow.
Our bilateral trade now exceeds $10 billion, but these figures can be doubled.
First and foremost, new technologies in health care, artificial intelligence and robotics.
Our trade is not just tanks and heavy industries.
According to Manish Kumar, India has already established initial contacts with Russia’s modern centres.
For example, a delegation from Delhi and other cities had recently visited Skolkovo and Innocent.
We have signed a memorandum of understanding on the development of systems in which we can build our modern business.
After all, entrepreneurship is not a whim, but a necessity.
The step we need is towards economic well-being.
We need to expand, attract small and medium-sized businesses, and together with Russia, China, and other countries, we will definitely do so,” the Indian industrialist stressed.

In Congress, Trump's conversation with Zelensky saw a Russian trail.
In the lower house of the United States Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of involvement in a scandal caused by a telephone conversation between the head of the White House, Donald Trump, and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky.
The suggestion that the story might somehow be "Russians" was made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, transmitting MSNBC News.
“The Russians, I believe, put their hand to it,” the Democrat said, but did not comment further.
The Pelosi-led Democrats, who hold the majority in the House, had previously announced the launch of impeachment proceedings against the President.
This happened after Trump was complained to by an intelligence informant.
The informant suspected that Trump, in a conversation with Zelensky in July, had put pressure on his interviewee to file a case against the son of former Vice-President Joseph Biden, the latter of whom could become Trump's electoral competitor in a year's time.
The White House had to provide congressmen and the public with a transcript of a scandalous conversation.

The expert told me why we should give up the tea in the bags.
A group of Canadian scientists from McGill University found that when a cup of tea is made, more than ten billion microplastic particles are collected in five minutes.
Food safety expert Elizabeth Tikhonov said National News may also add sawdust particles to the packaged drink.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be listed on the package.
The sawdust don't throw away at the end of the season, so they could end up in tea.
"More than that, it's not always tea plants that are included in the packets," Tikhonova said.
She said that it would be better not to use such a drink in favour of a hanger, which was sold in specialized shops.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of bagged tea was not only in composition but also in the method of producing it - microparticles were heated to high temperatures, so that they could start to release harmful substances.
"The best thing to do is to get clean green or black tea, which will be the least added to this drink," the expert pointed out.

Regions have been asked to share business support secrets
On 27 September, the Chairman of the Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy, Andrei Kutepov, was informed by the Parliamentary Gazette, sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development, Maxim Oreshkin, and the Minister of Finance, Anton Siluanov, inviting him to express his position on the initiatives of the constituent entities of the Federation to improve legislation in the area of support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It's time to build interregional ties.
The Economic Policy Committee of the Federation Council compiled information from the regions on their programmes for the development of businesses and the legalization of self-employed, as well as on the outcomes of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions presented to the senators the problems of SME development and made proposals for improving existing legislation.
“To date, communication between regions has not been sufficiently developed, as a result of which visits by senators to all regions by the business community have highlighted the lack of information on regional entrepreneurship development programmes in the country as a whole”, Andrei Kutepov noted.
In an annex to the letter to the Government, he presented a compilation of regional positive developments in the legalization of self-employment and a summary of regional data with proposals and issues (available for revision).
In addition to the relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions were also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on good practices in the regions could stimulate entrepreneurship in general.
The first step towards such an exchange would be to convey the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy, said the Senator to the Parliamentary Gazette.
Useful experience
Today, support programmes for small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and are operating successfully in many regions of the country.
For example, in Vologodsk oblast, there is an Enterprise Support Centre which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in certification of finished products.
In Ivanov province, a business support system has been developed to implement the single-window principle through multifunctional centres.
In Krasnodar province, grants are provided to start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives from the provincial budget.
There is a cluster development centre in Orlov oblast.
The Amur region, within the framework of the federal project “Acceleration of Small and Medium-sized Entrepreneurs”, provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators established on the basis of existing non-State co-working centres with federal funds.
In a number of other regions, special support measures are being implemented for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to be brought out of the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of legislative changes are needed to better support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Arkhangel region proposed to replace the term “self-employment” with “business activities”, as this “is most appropriate to the content of the public service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In Ivanovsk province, amendments are considered necessary to expand the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including those related to the finishing and repair of accommodations, home constructions and physical training.
The Bryansk region believes that it is important to strengthen the control of unscrupulous dairy producers through the Mercure veterinary system.
In Kostrom and Magadan oblasts, the concept of social entrepreneurship and support for social entrepreneurship are advocated in the legal framework.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills”, Andrei Kutepov said.
The airline helped the passengers avoid the neighborhood with crying children.
Japan Airlines (JAL) has launched a new feature: when booking seats on the plane, you can now find out where the small children will sit.
Now, if you want to stay close to them, you can avoid them.
The Japanese airline Japan Airlines (JAL) was able to use the new option and avoid unwanted neighborhoods with small children.
The air carrier has launched a function that allows us to track where the children are going to sit.
When you select seats in the cabin, passengers will be able to see the child ' s head in the area, which is occupied by children between 8 days and 2 years of age.
Thus, those who do not want to fly with the babies because of possible inconveniences associated with their crying can be accommodated as far away from them as possible.
The Internet users who use airline services were thrilled by the innovation.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the users complained that he flew from New York to Doha a few weeks ago, and there were three crying kids sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested the introduction of a “juvenile flight only” expressing his willingness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists have noted that they will now always try to choose Japan Airlines for their movements, as they see nothing pleasant about flying next to a crying child in a closed space.
Previously, a woman traveling with a baby tried to graze her travelers on the Seoul-San Francisco flight.
She prepared a bag of sweets for each of the 200 passengers, each of which contained a note of apology.
Did the Oleg Tabakova train show up on the subway in the capital city?
If you are always using the Kalujsko-Rijsko Line (as most of the inhabitants of Konkov do), you will be surprised.
A new theme train, "The Great Russian Artist Oleg Tabakov", was launched on the subway.
Every day, 10,000 people are transported by this train.
He's on the orange line and he's talking about the director, actor and founder of the Tabakerk Theatre.
By the way, it is convenient for Konkov to go to performances that play on the new stage of the theatre (it is located in Sukharevski Square, near the Sukharevskaya subway).
As we were told by the Moscow Metro Press Service, “in the external design of the Thematic Train, images of stained stained stained scenes of the new scene are used and the portraits of Oleg Tabakov are placed in the symbols he created in theatre, cinema and cartoons”.
The train tells of his family, the play "Matrosca Silence", from which the great life of the theatre began, the Tabakerk itself, and the director's work.
Rare archived images and film images can be seen on the walls of wagons.
Russian gays with adopted children sought asylum in the United States
A same-sex couple of Russians with two adopted children applied for asylum in the U.S., handing over RIA News.
The men reportedly left the Russian Federation for Ukraine, after which they went to the States where they applied for asylum.
According to Stimul, the basis for such actions by the family was “the continuing interest of the law enforcement agencies”.
It is reported that men are not planning to return to Russia.
Children have been attending American school since the beginning of the school year and are adapting to new conditions.
As will be recalled, it has previously been reported that a case has been brought against members of the social welfare department of the Marjino district because of the adoption of two young boys by a same-sex family.
The HRC stated, however, that raising children with a same-sex couple should not in itself become a cause of action.

Pavel Ustinov joined the pickets in support of the Moscow case.
Acter Pavel Ustinov joined a series of single pickets entitled “Freedom for all”, which are held on Friday at the office of the President of the Russian Federation in the Old Square in Moscow, broadcast by the Interfax correspondent.
The picket series began on 18 September in support of Ustinov himself and has continued every day since then.
At present, the participants are standing in succession, holding a poster with the inscription “Freedom for all” and the names of the convicted and arrested after uncoordinated meetings in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, the name on the poster is Yegor Zhukov, Cyril Zhukov, Danil Begletz, Yevgeny Kovalenko, Konstantin Kotov, Ivan Podkopaev, Aydar Gubaydulin, Alexeya Miniylo, Sergei Fomina, Samariddin Rajabova, Nikita Chirtsov, Eduard Babylevsky, Vladislav Sinitsa.
On 16 September, the Tver Moscow Court sentenced 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years in a general regime colony on charges of violence against an OMON Rosgvardiya fighter in an uncoordinated action on 3 August in the centre of Moscow (article 318, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code).
Subsequently, on 20 September, at the request of the Office of the Prosecutor-General, the court changed Ustinov ' s preventive measure from detention to a non-departure subscription.
Thus, a petition for the liberation of Ustinov received more than 112,000 signatures in 24 hours.
Theatre and film artists started a flash mob in support of a colleague.
To participate in a single picket in solidarity with the actor on 18 September, a line was lined up in the Old Square.
Human rights defenders, journalists, academics, teachers, doctors and Orthodox priests demanded a review of the case.
According to Interfax's sister Ustinov Yulia, at a rally in the capital on 29 September in support of the Moscow case, her brother is not planning to speak.
The "sanction" supplies to Russia fell 100 times.
The Russian government estimated that the supply of agricultural and food products to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo had declined more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries in the first half of 2019, compared with 3 million 442.2 thousand tons in the same period in 2013, reports Interfax.
However, the value of imported products fell to $226.5 million from $4 billion,975.5 million respectively.
These are shipments of goods that have not been embargoed.
As indicated in the report, the volume of prohibited imports was offset by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia.
It will be recalled that at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the regulations on the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from entering Russia under counter-sanctions.
The document posted on the official legal information portal noted that the rules had been extended by one more year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Originally, products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway, and Canada were covered by the Destruction Order.
Subsequently, from 13 August 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Ukraine joined the list as of 1 January 2016.
Putin's decree on the destruction of a “sanction” (food embargo products that Moscow imposed in response to Western anti-Russian sanctions) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has allowed the destruction of “sanctionary” food in any legal way.
As Western sanctions continued, the Russian Federation had also extended its response.
Products imported by citizens for personal use are not subject to this measure.
The prohibition does not apply to the importation of goods for personal consumption of up to 5 kilograms.
However, the President of the Russian Federation's Council for Civil Society Development and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, had previously called the “just immoral” destruction of food, which, he said, had a negative impact on the upbringing of people.

Chile started building a 1 billion euro telescope
This is reported by TASS with reference to the Press Service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, the construction of the building's dome, where the E-ELT telescope (European Extreme Large Telescope) will be located, was officially launched this week, so long as the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project.
Its total value is estimated by ESO to exceed a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on equipment and the building of the observatory.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, with a diameter of about 39 meters.
It will be collected from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 metres.
This huge mirror, as well as two supporting reflecting surfaces of 4.2 and 3.75 meters in diameter, will help to obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and search for Earth's doppelgangers.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Although construction of the dome has just begun, mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory have been developed by scientists, engineers and other specialists for three years, since the announcement of the first plans for E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, with a total value of about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German firm SCHOTT and to the French company Safran Reosc.
