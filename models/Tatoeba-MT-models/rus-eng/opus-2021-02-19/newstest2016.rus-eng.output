The social card of a resident of Ivanov province is recognized as an electronic payment tool.
The changes provide for the continuation of the travel benefit in public passenger transport.
Since 24 September, the arrangements for the preferential travel of citizens have been changed using the social map of the resident of Ivanova province.
According to the press service of the Russian Government in the Ivanov province, the changes provide for the maintenance of travel privileges in public passenger transport and bring the social card settlement scheme into line with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 on the national payment system.
The social card of a resident of Ivanov province is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application have changed.
Thus, the replenishment limit is no longer fixed on travel as before, but on the amount of money, with winter and summer periods not exceeding 400 roubles in winter, and not more than 800 roubles in summer for the current month.
From now on, the social card holders on the receipts issued in the transport operations will need to track the balance rather than the number of trips left.
The cost of a concessionary journey for citizens would be 1/2 of the carrier's fare.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule for the replenishment of the social map remains the same, from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new mode of travel on the social map will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to keep a detailed record of cash expenditure on a social map to the extent of a penny.
In addition, it is possible to recover credits but unspent funds.
Let us also add that the settlement scheme with the carriers becomes transparent, as the national now pays half of the cost of travel and the same amount reimburses the carrier for the budget.
No commission will be charged when the money is placed on the map.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Road and Transport Department of Ivanov province, reported that more than 33 million trips using a social map had taken place in the region in 2014 and nearly 25 million trips in 2015.
More than 470 million roubles are provided for in the regional budget for the provision of preferential travel for citizens using a social map.
As at 1 September, more than 312 million roubles had been reimbursed for this purpose.
At the time of the 911 call, the teacher will confess to the murder of a friend.
During the 911 call, the teacher at Shannon Lamb University told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that he needed staff to come to their home.
Lamb stressed that there was a dog in the house who was alive, but probably upset, and said that the contact of the family members of the deceased could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a note that was hand-wrapped on a white sheet of linen paper: "I'm sorry if I wanted it back, I loved Amy, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to authorities signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who had conducted two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then travelled 300 miles to the university campus, where the police believed he had shot and killed a respected history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, on the doorstep of his office.
The chief of police at Delta State University, Lynn Baford, reported that the university had learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that true 911 call shortly after.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the educational institution forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, the authorities were still trying to paint a single picture of the motives behind Lamb.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to draw a picture of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his class.
The police in Gauthier, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he expressed appreciation to the “pretty people” with whom he had crossed paths in his teaching life.
They both taught at the Faculty of Social Science and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
A student who spoke well of Lamb, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb had told him at the end of the 2014–15 school year how he was coping with stress.
Previously, Lamb asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
He only taught two online courses this year.
Recent changes in university recruitment rules meant that the doctorate that Lamb had worked so hard to obtain would not guarantee him an automatic teaching position.
University president William Laforge said he didn't know anything about the Lamb-Schmidt conflict, but "apparently, Mr Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb can't answer anymore.
The police attacked Lamb after he escaped campus on his way back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-gauge gun in the backyard of the house, one mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, and reported to the coroner of Washington Metel Johnson County.
His car with the engine still stood on the driveway.
It was not clear to him why Lamb had come to the house, although, according to Johnson, she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received a doctorate in pedagogy in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as a smart, charismatic and fun man.
Carla Hayrston told me she was 15 years old, and Lamb was 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends went to high school, and he was a great older guy who spent years trying to teach her how to play guitar.
It was a success for women in those years.
All the girls were melting when he was around," says Hayrston, now 40, who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss, at the time of the events, have apparently been together for some time.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gauthier in a brick house, the opposite of which comes to the canal.
According to the police, there's nothing wrong with the dog.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Stin, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they had a daughter who was 19 years old.
"She's completely depressed," told O'Stin about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't see Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played the concerts together from time to time.
O'Stin told me his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schaffer, the bartender and co-facilitator of entertainment programs in the dimly lit bar The Juliet Room in Gauthier's suburb, said that he had last seen Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica for a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were having fun and making fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, held seminars for freshmen and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America, told Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of student brotherhood and student self-government.
At Delta State University campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university professors, staff, students and community members, participated in a candlelight memorial ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The class will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforge.
The crisis's over.
It's recovery day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare the Associated Press by Emily Wagster Pettius in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police's statement that Lamb's 911 call came into service after Schmidt's murder, and that although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season.
Toys R Us reports that he will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as he did last year, and the toy and toy director for children assures that he will allow regular and temporary staff to work more hours.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and wholesale bases throughout the country, which is less than the 45,000 hired during the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company has indicated that it will begin interviews with the applicants this month and will increase staff from October to December.
Although a few months before the holidays, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to have enough staff in the shops and to sell, ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about dating Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" turned out to be a huge event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat at the cinema and waited for the royal family to arrive, "I noticed that the place next to me was free, and it struck me that Princess Diana would be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer by the soon-to-be-screen documentary "Back in Time".
The movie starts, and it comes to my mind that I'm literally at a distance of my arm and in one fake yawn from dating the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary on "Back to the Future" includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as directed by Robert Zemekis and executive producer Stephen Spielberg.
The film "Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"For me," Spielberg says, "this is no doubt the greatest movie about time travel that has ever been filmed."
Back in time will be available on VOD, DVD and some cinemas in October.
The head of the United Nations states that there is no military solution in Syria.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in response to Russia's military support for Syria, states that for almost five years of conflict, there is no “military solution”, and an increase in armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN Head once again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon announced at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning a meeting with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five permanent members of the Council — the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France — during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that disagreements within the council, as well as among the Syrians and the local authorities, had “made the situation impossible”.
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in addressing the issue of Iran ' s nuclear programme and the Syrian crisis.
Eight poll results that show Donald Trump is not joking.
Some tried to label him as a provocateurs.
Others turned their backs on him, taking it as a joke.
And some people want a scandal.
But as some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump’s high position in the polls, they have failed (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have shown Donald Trump's advantage in double digits, and some are beginning to ask seriously what this means for a real estate tycoon in terms of the chances of getting a nomination.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at that time in 2011, Rick Perry was outdone by the popular Herman Kane, none of whom won one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in the general election.
But external groups such as Jeb Bush’s SuperCommittee of Political Activity, and the growth club’s economic conservative group, recognize Trump’s unflagging power and begin to pull out their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some of the poll numbers that say that a real estate magnate is not just an intermediate phase:
The sympathy ratings for Trump have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive attitude towards this real estate tycoon.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 per cent.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive attitude towards Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these numbers are going to get the best of the early stages.
Quinnipiac in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of the Republicans there were positive for Trump.
Two thirds of the votes for the GOP would have set up Trump as a candidate.
In a survey conducted by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they were either enthusiastic or satisfied if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of ten say they'd be upset if he were a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they'd be “happily” compared to 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
Next in line?
Marco Rubio, who's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they'll be "dissatisfied" or "disappointed" if Jeb Bush's establishment prefers to be a candidate.
Most Republicans don't think Trump's temperament is a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters across the country think that the magnate has the right temper to be president, as shown by the ABC News/Washington Post poll held on Monday.
The same figure appears at the country's first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same man who could be chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent think that he is not an effective person at the post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temper is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to that idea.
When they wear their expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
Asked who was the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was a favorite, according to a survey by CNN/ORC last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of 10 were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters had never had the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the last cycle, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it shows that many GOP voters find Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to rally around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some scholars point out that this dispersion is likely to have an advantage for Trump, while not supporting Trump is evenly distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always enjoys majority support.
He's 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points, Jeb Bush 19 points, and finally, Randa Paul, John Kasich, and Chris Christie 33 points.
He's got a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson beat a businessman to 19 points in a one-on-one hypothetical competition.
A little over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll, conducted on Tuesday, shows that only more than half of the voters supporting Trump say they're sure of their votes.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
Forty-six per cent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition at the moment is with an outsider colleague, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapids” two months ago in his campaign opening speech, immigration has become the most relevant topic in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's posturing will deter key Latin American voters from the Republican Party and hinder rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration attracts attention, Donald Trump seems to remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of approximately half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
Six out of ten Republicans on Monday's new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than a man with government experience.
And they're also offended at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with Republican activity in Congress, with 54 per cent “unsatisfied” and 21 per cent in anger.
The government will decide the fate of pension indexing in October.
Vice-Premier Olga Holodez stated that the Government was now looking for options to implement the Pension Indexing Act in 2016 to meet the real inflation rate, and was referring it to the WG.
She noted that a solution should be found by 8 October, by the time the draft budget was submitted to the Government for the following year.
In addition, the cabmine is discussing the option of extending the decision to freeze Russia's contributory pension.
The hunger striker noted that the amount of pension savings was 350 billion roubles.
About the same amount is worth indexing pensions in full for the following year.
According to the Vice-Premier, there is not yet a final decision on who should pay the contributions for non-working citizens.
If a person does not work on his or her own initiative and does not belong to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for it.
In the past, the media reported that there are two options for balancing the State’s budget in Kabul.
Why are eyelids often irritated and blushing?
An ophthalmologist, Tatiana Levashova, answers:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
By forgetting the regular cleansing of the century, we often contribute to the development of bluffing ourselves.
The exit is simple:
Do not triple your eyes with your dirty hands, carry with you a special wet napkin for the eyelids.
At least one or two times a day, cleanse the ends of the century of the harmful substances accumulated in them during the day.
Cleaning procedures should also be supplemented by warm compresses with herbs (sage, chamomile) that soften the thick secret of the salivary glands, followed by massages in the edge of the century, which should be carried out by circular movement of the finger cushions;
When washing your makeup, do not use alcohol - containing devices.
They dry and dehydrate the skin, and contribute to the further thickening of the secret of sleep glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclears have created a nuclear warhead.
North Korean authorities have reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the Yongbyon nuclear complex, is operating “at full capacity”.
This was reported on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to “the US aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “in both quantity and quality”.
The last test of nuclear weapons was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, no plans have been reported since then to resume the full operation of the reactor.
Pyongyang claims that he was able to create a nuclear warhead.
The Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea has also conducted tests of medium- and short-range missiles on several occasions, writing polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the reference to brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the reference to the alliance of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said so during the State Duma meeting, reporting Russian News.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand it," said Zhirinovsky.
The Deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the quadruples that contain this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky stated that the current anthem should be changed to "God save the king," and the Russian tricolour replaces the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad called on all forces to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Assad believes that if Europe is to deal with the refugee problem, it must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem must be addressed.
If Europeans care about refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That is our opinion on the issue.
"That's the essence of the refugee question," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to achieve consensus.
However, if we want real success, it will not be possible until people are killed, until the bloodshed continues, and until people feel completely safe.
“We can therefore reach consensus, but we cannot achieve anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria”, Assad stressed.
Let us recall that about 500,000 migrants, including Syrian migrants, arrived in the EU during this year.
The European Commission has stated that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that thousands of fighters from the extremist group “Islamic State” may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to create their own cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The people of the German city had a holiday for refugees.
In the past month, Germany has become a refugee reception leader, although it recently strengthened border controls to contain the influx.
The authorities estimate that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts cite significantly large numbers.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited Darmstadt city, where migrants are very welcome.
Jeremy Corbin debuts at the Prime Minister's questions session.
After Mr. Corbin's election, his debut at the question session is very much awaited by the Prime Minister.
The new Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbin will be speaking for the first time at the Prime Minister's questions session, with David Cameron in his hands for the first time.
Mr. Corbin will deliver the first of the six questions in the afternoon; his presentation is likely to be followed closely by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for “less theater and more facts” in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could skip some meetings by leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as leader, following his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech at the Tread-Union Annual Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to remain silent while performing the national anthem on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has been criticized by a number of conservative members of Parliament and has been the subject of several headlines in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
Mr. Corbin's spokesman stated that he “standed in respectful silence” and recognized the “heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain”.
However, a member of Mr. Corbin's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC 2 Newsnight that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “independently” of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbin ' s team, expressing differences on economic, defence and international politics, while less than one sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political disagreements will also pile up in the Labour Party after Mr. Corbin's appointment to the European Union and the Government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Tread-Union conference that the Labour Party had amended the idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Shadow Minister of Labour and Pensions, stated that there was “full clarity” in the party that it was opposed only to the Government's plans to reduce the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth Labour leader to be met by David Cameron at the courier box in the last 10 years since he became the Conservative Party leader.
The Labour leader, who had promised a different approach to politics, states that he “gave in the collective resources” to get ideas for Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Ailington North, a Member of Parliament, said that the Prime Minister's questions caused unnecessary confrontation, and that he would refrain from witty answers and exchange of bells, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems faced by young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Economy in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also expressed the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he had spoken to the Speaker of the House, Commons John Berkow, to discuss the matter.
As leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to move away from the political style of the “Yarmar Balagan” often associated with the Prime Minister's question procedure, but admitted several years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, questions to the Prime Minister have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to govern the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires extensive reforms.
Homeless young people who learned from photographers
The Johannesburg Business Center is a tough place for homeless people.
But a group of former street children found a way to master the trade and earn a living.
"I was filmed in Yoburg" is a non-profit studio that trains homeless young people to take pictures of the neighborhood and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound sterling rises as wages rise in the UK
The pound grew in response to the rise in British wages, with the FTSE 100 index rising as a result of the offer to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, UK earnings increased by 2.9 per cent, less bonuses, compared with the same period last year.
Growth rates have been the highest since 2009 and have been seen as a postponement of projections for possible increases in quotations.
The pound rose by more than 1% from the dollar to $1.5505, and by 0.84% from the euro to the euro to the dollar.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general terms, SABMiller's shares increased by 20 per cent, thanks to an offer from AB InBev's competitor.
The deal would bring together two of the world's largest brewing companies with brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni, and Grolsch.
Burberry's stock grew by 0.9 percent against encouraging news from a rival group of luxury products manufacturers.
The latest data on Richemont sales surpassed expectations and showed that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, had begun to grow again.
Glancore's stock grew by 5% after a mining giant claimed to have been able to raise $2.5 billion through equity, as part of a debt-reduction strategy.
Mondi's paper and packaging group's shares were leading the fall in the index - by 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs reduced the band's rating to "sell".
JD Sports stock grew after the sports clothing company reported an 83 per cent increase in pre-tax profits six months to £46.6 million.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can prevent expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in labour costs, he says.
The cost could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could have meant a decrease in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash is launching a bottom-up campaign to fight Aldi's attack.
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
A bottom-up food wholesaler launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retelelers in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the upcoming Aldi infusion of $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and West Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relations with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream media and social media and at events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA retailers and suppliers, such as Simmo's ice cream manufacturer from Dunsboro, who offers tasting at IGA stores, and shopkeepers selling discounted tickets to regular customers at South Australian Football League matches, join the campaign.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on 29 September, the day that this wholesaler of food, alcohol and household goods will observe its annual investor strategy day.
In South Australia and Western Australia, IGA stores account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and are more profitable than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known to adhere to the usual routes, so the market is more favourable for IGA players than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA, compared with about 14 per cent in Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of its first stores, taking sales from all players present, but mostly from independent retakers.
In a report released this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst for Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA retakers could lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, selling $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
The loss of revenues and sales of food at high fixed costs of Metcash could cost the company about 13 million income before paying interest and taxes, according to Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is because a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglas's leading stock manager, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, observed attending a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash "may be highly likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
But it is believed that a member of the Metcash board contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
IGA ' s market share has declined from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and Metcash ' s food business revenues, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA reteleliers, have fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, owing to operational defiance and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually to equalize retail prices with those of Coles and Wolworths at thousands of points weekly, and helping IGA retelelers to re-engineer trading sites, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider choice of branded foods.
Metcash Director General Ian Morris says that price equalization and remodelling are gaining momentum, and hopes that the company will increase its net profits in 2017, the first time in four years.
Tanashi Kokkinakis is supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves credit, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly injured in a recent scandal about his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more credit than criticism for his behavior, as President Tennis Australia says Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, Jr. in a talented duet and often known as Special Ks, was unwittingly at the centre of attention because of Kirios' shameful fight with Stan Vavrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Soon after, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnatti, the judge at the tower had to split Kokkinakis twice with his opponent Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said, "Vavrinka was supposed to be laid on Kirios' scapulas, and I had to put this guy's scapulas."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racket after the convulsions in his leg saved Richard Gaske from possible defeat on the US Open, Healy loyally protects Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second to Bernard Tomić in solitary confinement in the semi-finals of the Davis Cup v. Britain.
"I'm very worried about one thing, that Tanasi was involved in a conflict," said Healy.
He did break a racket when he had a foot on the US Open, but he wasn't the first player to break a racket when hopes collapsed, and I know Tanashi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good at himself in pretty provocative situations at the US, Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he's trustworthy.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works hard, he's a great team member, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's intensely trained, he's in great shape, he's a very motivated and advanced young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match that began on Friday, believing that "reciprocal consent" was the right way out for everyone, but hoping that a guy from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term player.
"Previously, we want the team to focus entirely on the match, not on the arguments around [Cirios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick gained power very quickly, as people like Federer and Marray prove, he grows up in front of the public, he's made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of the spotlight for a while so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary proclaims an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
Having declared a state of emergency, Hungary had closed the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and detained those who were attempting to enter the country illegally to contain the influx of migrants.
There had been riots along the border, with hundreds of migrants gathering on the border, to which the Serbian authorities had reacted sharply.
Once trapped indefinitely on a section of the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their home country broke up tents and settled in the area.
However, frustration increased.
When they were surrounded by a police helicopter, the migrants shouted, "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian Special Forces.
Some have refused food and water in protest.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared the expulsion of migrants from Hungary “unacceptable” when more and more migrants arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
It is necessary to negotiate with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” said Ivica Dačić in Prague.
The disturbances at the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after a block of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (in the following month or by the end of the year) that EU member States would accept an additional 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis affecting the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect prompt action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close the roads and expedite asylum cases.
Meanwhile, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Sillarto, stated that his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants through the country, now that it had completed the fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were involved in urgent work to complete a barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary has become the main “restraint” and EU border crossing point for settlers, many of whom are refugees who are victims of war in Syria and the Middle East.
Nevertheless, Prime Minister Victor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees, who are victims of war, who are entitled to protection, and this view is sharply different from that of other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws, which entered into force in Hungary at midnight, now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison terms for those accused of human trafficking.
“Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government has declared a state of emergency”, Government spokesman Zoltan Kovac told journalists in the southern town of Seged.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, Parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters, who are at the border, have been monitoring the presence of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Diergy Bacondi, Orban's national security adviser, reported the capture by the authorized authorities of 45 persons who had tried to cross the border at the border itself and 15 others inside the country.
They have crossed the border by breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of having committed administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, with a railway wagon wrapped in barbed wire to block one of the passages.
The disturbances broke out at the main border crossing near the town of Rjoske, Hungary, as Hungarians placed a service space for people inside a metal container, and crowds pushed each other to break inside.
Approximately 20 individuals were able to penetrate, with thousands of people remaining outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road from Serbia to Hungary and announced that food and water would be denied until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has been halved in the national survey
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit advantage in the Democrat race for nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support among the primary democratic voters (down from 58 per cent), and Sanders is second to 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to take part in the presidential race, is supported by 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the contest in the primary elections, most Democrat voters say it is too early to say that they have made up their minds about the candidate they will support.
Clinton’s supporters are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton retains a great advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has been reduced.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind.
Clinton’s preference for democratic voters to the age of 50 has disappeared, and he and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
But Clinton still has a great advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton beat Sanders to two digits among the liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Almost half of the original Democrat voters across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support it only because it was a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
Perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about it.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, views are more controversial – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48 per cent of primary democratic voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked the open question why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), then that she is now a woman president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for the post (10 per cent).
Clinton’s supporters also speak of an association that links it to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It's also called an agreement on the issues and the chances of election.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic voters would like him to join the race, although one third believe he should not.
When they are asked who they would like to see second among party candidates, the primary Democratic voters in most cases call Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say that they would have picked Biden second, which is more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to stand for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the racers to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of Democrat voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
On this score, Biden is in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in answering the question of what is most important about the candidate, Democratic voters choose options other than the chances of being elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the candidates from Democrats or potential candidates is an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results in some key features among their party’s primary voters.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden, of all three, leads by honesty, and Clinton's strong side is in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of primary democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be fair and credible, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a definite opinion on it.
The original Democrat voters also generally consider the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be similar.
By all these standards, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Although questions about Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail and server are still being asked by her Secretary of State, most of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and feel that this has not adversely affected their general view of her.
But that's a different story for the American public as a whole.
Half the Americans today are dissatisfied with her explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided as early as March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the e-mail controversy has not affected their general opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinion has worsened.
Most of them are Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim that their opinion of Clinton has worsened.
Even though Clinton is perceived as a fair and credible voter by her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent consider her to be fair and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than in May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump, however, are both getting good grades in leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson, and Bush show the best results in honesty.
Most people see Sanders as an honest man rather than an honest man, but as Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Based on a national survey, Ben Carson is close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson approached Donald Trump in the last CBS/New York Times survey.
The two candidates won half the vote in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of a foothold.
Republican voters throughout the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, with a 23 per cent increase in support from the recent CBS poll held the previous month's Fox News debate, to 27 per cent from the Tuesday poll.
But Carson took off from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoys support in all demographic groups, replacing Trump in a group of Republican voters with a higher education.
The other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Kasic, rolled back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Hakabi, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio together ranked third with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this recent poll is plus or minus 6 per cent, and the survey was conducted in September.
A recent survey by CNN/ORC, published last week, showed Carson’s growth in the polls – showing 19 percent support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32 percent support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also revealed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
Due to Carson's growing support last week, Trump made some critical remarks against the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of a freshman at Baruch College.
About two years after the death of a college student during the dedication ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder charge was brought against five people.
"P. Delta Psi brothers from Baruch New York College brutally attacked Chan "Mickle" Deng during the initiation ceremony in September 2013 and failed to get him to hospital in time, leading to his death," reported to the police.
Officials say that a student with a blindfold and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times as he tried to reach the target, walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
P. Delta Psi's brothers didn't call 911 when Deng passed out, and they were supposed to wait an hour before getting him to the hospital, and they're talking to the police.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the National Brotherhood President, to ask advice on what the chief of police, Chris Wagner, said at the press conference.
"At this point, members of the brotherhood began to hide their personal belongings, essentially placing the welfare of the brotherhood above the health of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng sustained several blunt head, torso and thigh injuries.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of frat initiation rituals, since at least one student dies every year since 1970,” Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in his statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Monroe County's jury leaned in favour of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with assault and conspiracy.
“We want to hold accountable not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has authorized all of this formally or informally, so too,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood removed the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
There'll be a rise in rates, and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will collapse into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take before the attack, and how long it's going to last.
Specifically for economics, history doesn't explain much about time.
The recession occurred only 11 months after the first rate increase and 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s rigidity in raising rates often, though not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the US Central Bank administration insists that investors should not focus on when they start raising rates, but on how much adaptation will take.
Indeed, there are many variables in the game.
After all, however, market participants may find that all the fuss about rising rates is exaggerated.
“The first upturn in Federal Reserve rates with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of cheap money,” said Julian Jessop, chief international economics specialist at Capital Economics, in his client commentary.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic momentum that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a view of how some areas of the economy could respond according to historical trends:
As the market has seen in the past month or so, waiting for higher rates could lead to volatility for some time.
When the rate rises, however, the consequences are usually less dramatic.
“It doesn’t seem like the equity returns have slowed by 12 to 24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects the delay in monetary policy,” said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the Federal Reserve’s rate rise.
More specifically, the market has tended to change dramatically over the past 35 years or so - about 14 per cent - upwards, remaining fairly stable for 250 days after that (average growth 2.6 per cent), then reverting to normality after 500 days, with an average return of 14.4 per cent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, the chief stock strategyr at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Baron's.
Deutsche says that the outcome for securities has a tendency not to immediately become more pronounced at the rate rise, and equity returns are beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they are often aided by higher rates.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that were not previously in place and that may accelerate the recession.
Most of the gross domestic product will be at its lowest point since the high rate.
Deutsche Bank claims that in 118 cases, only twice the nominal annual GDP has been below 4.5 per cent since 1950.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it will last long, while it is only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
The rise in rates on such a volatile economic background can be risky and raises the question of whether this time will be different, as reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing for the Federal Reserve to raise their rates throughout the year, with their views tied to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
So far, many policy experts and economists believe that FOMC could approve a bid increase at this meeting, futures trade is only 25 percent likely.
“In our study since 1950, all the cycles of rate hikes to date have been in a supercycle of increasing fiscal leverage with GDP blocking the peaks leading to recession very quickly after recovery,” the report says.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle is now the longest one that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, a total of 74 months and is not yet over.
Fixed income has also become unstable, while the market is expecting higher rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to what is being sold for shares.
The fundamental difference is that the bond effect will be faster than the equity effect when the Federal System changes strategic direction.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the yield changes the vector immediately after the first rise/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate increase cycle, the bond returns fall immediately," Deutsche reports.
Strategy experts from Charles Schwab believe that rising rates will bring long-term and short-term bond returns closer, making the curve more flat.
High-return bonds often behave better in this climate, although “we are still afraid of fluctuations in profitability”, says Katy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected policy results of the Federal System.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are signs that the market has been set up to look at a tougher monetary policy,” she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is more flat, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all market characteristics with the tightening of Federal system policy.
Generally speaking, companies that run major businesses in the US will benefit from higher interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts would be in a worse position, as the rising dollar made their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt more expensive in the financial area.
“The story shows that “quality” shares are more effective than market shares within three months of the initial rate increase,” says Goldman Sachs analysts in the client report.
Firms with stable financial conditions bypassed companies with unstable conditions, resulting in each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
High-income companies, as well as low-volatility equities, have also shown better performance than low-quality shares by an average of 4 (interest points) and 3 (interest points) respectively.
Duty will be a big question.
High-interest floating-rate companies will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts differ as to how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM," says Conservative Member Andrew Bingham.
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "reducing standards"
Proves she's getting less different from a commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award was just ripped off by Brits.
Damian Collins, a parliamentary colleague, who hit The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," said the leader of the Members of Parliament, encouraging the company to prove that it is doing something that commercial companies do not do.
Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told BBC management that it seemed that the public radio station was being “stupid” and was becoming less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems -- I don't like using the word "simplification" -- but it seems to be turning into a Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits with a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are two examples that came to my mind first, where you're actually just copying what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
BBC's CEO denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is way ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performances and music creation is really no match for anyone else.
"Also really important, I think, is Radio 3's interest in finding new music and promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey claimed that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past, because the British were less educated in classical music.
Radio 3 was not, however, the only BBC child who was attacked by commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Tory Damien Collins, MP, attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that the BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of £22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because of a lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George sit as judges, was made in the "BBC style".
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit in its own stable" the next time she launched a entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the ordering of the new seasons of The Voice in the future or to use the money of those paying the licence fee for other entertaining formats.
Internet sales slowed down as much as possible in August, and Black Friday could be the fault.
There was a 7 per cent increase in online sales in the first three months of 2015
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began to be monitored in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago with mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could help contain the waste
For about ten years, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there are signs of levelling online sales now, after the latest figures show only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping expenditures in August have shown minimal growth since they began to be recorded in 2000, increasing by only 5 per cent.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are levelling off now that the latest data show only a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehi, IMRG sales index editor.
He explained that online sales had increased three years ago when buyers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, such as sitting on a couch.
But now it's coming to the plateau, and you can see the decline.
The Phenomene of Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons why sales are slowing down.
Experts believe that buyers might have refrained from buying on the eve of the event that took place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers, five times as many as average, rushed to computers to take advantage of good offers, destroying a number of vendors' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers go into a real fight for lucrative purchases, might have made people refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over £1 out of every 5 is spent online.
For products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third are sold through Internet shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more readily than in fashion stores on central streets.
Muslims bury those killed in the crash of a crane in Mecca, and sanctions have been imposed on the bin Laden family
Muslims carry the bodies of the 29 dead across the streets as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed the car accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also injured after the crash of the crane.
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the world flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims who had died as a result of the crash of a crane at the main Mecca mosque.
dressed mainly in white, those present at the funeral flooded the roadway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad procession passed by the sacred site, where just a few days earlier a construction crane had breached the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were handed over for burial, while the King of Saudis fined a construction company belonging to the Bin Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 parishioners killed in the crash of a crane at the Main Mosque were carried on the streets
Among the dead were Qasim Akram, the father of four children from Bolton, the Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman declared that Binladin Group should not have left an arrow raised with a crane that was not functioning.
The Arab version of the decree published by the Saudi Press Agency states that Binladin Group bears partial responsibility for the collapse.
The English editor of the news agency did not provide this detail, but reported that the company’s leaders were banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out why the crane had fallen into the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had flocked to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the crash of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inadequate coordination with the Meteorological Service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the extensive construction work being carried out by Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been among the closest of Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and has been managing the largest construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a traitor's son, who his family abandoned in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in life for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about 174,000 pounds) to the relatives of the deceased, and the same amount was irreversibly injured.
The rest of the victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q claims that the trend is due to the presence of East European craftsmen working for little money
According to Veronica Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair workers.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores throughout the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Principal City Correspondent, Daily Mail
They say the British put away hammers and paint brushes and instead hire qualified Easterners to do housework.
If you know how to handle a hammer or paint walls, you seem to be outnumbered these days.
Because, according to the owner company B&Q, the British are still hiring professional masters to do easy housework.
Veronica Laurie, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a network of house-building services, reported that the trend was followed by a substantial inflow of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open an additional 200 Screwfix stores specializing in craftsmen, while at the same time closing 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Laurie said that she would like to see more women in the staff of the B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions were made by women of the weak sex.
At present, the majority of staff are men.
She also said that recent demographic trends, characterized by an increase in the number of single-women households that were more involved in the development of their homes than in the past, could not be overlooked.
Ms. Laurie said, "Our shops are still dominated by men.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of decisions on goods purchased are made by women.
Women play an important role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women in charge of the leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team, achieving an equal number of men and women as directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the general and financial director.
Ms. Laurie said, “It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women on the board of directors was easy.
After the group took over the cost of closing the stores, Kingfisher showed a six-month decline in profits and sales.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new shops.
Decision time on US Federal Reserve interest rate
The world is watching a meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, where two days are spent discussing the crucial decision to raise an interest rate for the first time in a decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters revealed that just over half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve would do so last week are now expected to delay and maintain the rate at the current range of 0-025 per cent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach the fact that the main bank can move from zero to start the process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a leading official of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The US economy is working well, economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore the impact of the decision on the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should prepare for change, but they were convinced that all chances were against it.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
"Open up!": hundreds of refugees chanting at the Khorgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has blocked the border for the settlers.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to explore other routes to the EU.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
Another, through Croatia and Slovenia, to Austria.
According to some reports, the buses that took refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading towards the city of Shida on the Croatian border.
Drivers were instructed by the authorities to proceed without stopping.
Serbian Minister of the Interior Nebojša Stepanović assures that his country is doing its utmost to help the refugees, but its capacity is limited:
Our job is to keep Serbia as safe as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to be treated humanely.
But this is already a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve, and no country in Europe can do it alone, much less a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Premier Victor Orban is adamant:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia they must fill out the documents necessary to do so.
And if he doesn't, they won't let him into our country, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already built an 175-tilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there; he plans to build a similar fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Meimarakis has been part of the center-right governments for years, leading to a financial crisis, according to the left.
Now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, he challenges Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist named Euronews.
Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for inviting me.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat, yielding to SIRIZA’s coalition, but now, according to polls, New Democracy has become more popular with it.
What has changed in this time?
Vegelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and growth prospects.
The country is now again facing fiscal deficits and high unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country had been in January and the false promises made by Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what they promised to what really happened.
Daily life had become markedly worse than in January, when the situation had improved, and that had affected most Greek citizens.
But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SIRIZ.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The thing is, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in place, political forces and all ruling parties have come together to implement a programme on which they have agreed, without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of an agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece’s movement along the European path, because we are well aware of the disastrous consequences that a country’s withdrawal from the EU would have had.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, a Junker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost had there not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Tsipras’ negotiations.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
So if Europe sees that the new Greek government in its first year wants to establish order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has strong political will to implement a rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of what leads to recession can be renegotiated, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to assume that, in the first year of operation of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they await full implementation of the agreement.
If we are to regain their trust, we must continue the privatization, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continuing to take advantage of EU financing and the great investment opportunities that we must open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras Government did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, as we have learned from our discussions with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of the income of farmers.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Ministers of Tsipras had never spoken of it.
That is, Greek ministers were unprepared and poorly informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
If you win the election, you will soon find yourself at the same table as Mr. Junker, Holland, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Would what you tell them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we were trying best to implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing its sharp corners.
We have moved the reforms forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary resolve and speed, but we acted in extreme circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price of the Greek government.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to reconcile the views of the three parliamentary groups that were then the Government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a functioning parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
We were able to bring the country to a normal situation that would have continued to improve had the process not been interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: There has been a massive influx of refugees throughout Greece in recent weeks.
What do you think of this situation and the reaction of the European countries that these people are looking for?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with when we win the election.
And the reason is that the SIRIZA government did not act in the right way in this situation.
In such matters, we should be proactive, because if the problem hits you, there are only emergency measures left.
And that's the situation we're in now.
Even the temporary government that replaced SIRIZA did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions by the interim Government, which has received valuable assistance from the President of the Republic, who has called for an EU summit, will lead to a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary events that took place with them.
There is a profound humanitarian dimension to this issue, and we will stick to the position that European politicians must adopt in this new situation.
The relevant decision must be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, better border control and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance that the EU provides to deal with this pressing problem.
Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful town of Druzkovka, Donetsk province, during the course of the day, the criminal investigation officers of the Regional General Police Department, together with the military counter-intelligence officer, identified and detained a suspect, who was a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Kriva Rog (Dnepropetrovsk province), who had fired a machine gun at his opponent the previous night during the joint consumption of alcohol, and the resulting conflict in the village of Hautetoretsk Yasinovat district of Donetsina.
A 22-year-old boy was reported injured from a hospital where he was hospitalized with gunshot wounds through his legs.
According to Artem Vasitsky, Deputy Head of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Regional Police, during the course of operational action, the law enforcement officers proved the involvement of the subject in another serious criminal offence, the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operatives found that on the same day there was a conflict between the suspect and another local resident, resulting in a fatal gunshot wound to the head of the man.
Criminal proceedings under the articles “Intentional murder” and “Intentional infliction of serious bodily harm” of the Criminal Code have been opened by the Investigation Department of the DPP.
A detainee could be held for up to 15 years.
Figurant was detained and placed in a temporary detention facility, and reported to the Donetsk region police press service.
Two residents of Novosibirsk who painted several Soviet monuments in the colour of the Ukrainian flag, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, were sentenced by the Russian court to imprisonment.
Two other residents of the city were sentenced to imprisonment.
The inmates of Novosibirsk who received prison terms were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years ' imprisonment.
Two other convicted persons had been restricted their liberty for 14 and 18 months.
The Lenin Court of Novosibirsk found four citizens guilty of vandalism against Lenin's monuments, which were located on the premises of the CPRF Committee and on the Street of Trickotage, as well as on the memorial complex of the Monument Slava.
In the latter case, the Katyusha missile installation and the T-34 tank were painted.
Let us recall that on the night of 12 December, in Russian Novosibirsk, unknowns painted military equipment in the colour of the Ukrainian flag on the monument of Slava.
The common-law wife of a popular Russian actor, Evgeny Gyganov, Irina Leonov, gave birth to a seventh child.
The girl appeared at a Moscow clinic.
The newborn and her mother are feeling well.
Remember, recently the Gypsies and Leonov broke up.
Yevgeny refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambition for everything.
Eugenia is 36 years old.
He is an actor in the Moscow theatre "Master Petra Fomenko".
He is known for the films "The Walk", "Space as a Premonition", "Brest Fortune", "Ottel" and "Farza".
On September 8, Evgeny Gyganov was recognized as "Actor of the Year" and "Man of the Year" by the Russian version of popular GQ magazine.
The man who opened fire at Delta State University left an apology note.
Following the shooting and murder of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he was "sympathetic" about the first murder and wanted to "return everything," the authorities reported on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, report that a teacher in geography and social sciences at Delta State University called 911 around 10:00 in the morning.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there's a dog in the house that's not gonna hurt anyone, but probably upset.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't give it to me.
Lamb didn't explain why he fired.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found Amy Prentiss, age 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, age 45, saying, "I'd like to get it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday night, when he was surrounded by the police, he committed suicide.
University Rector William Laforge said he wasn't aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr Lamb obviously had something on his mind."
Despite information received on Monday that Lamb was suggesting a novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday “no information or evidence” of the “love triangle”.
Oh, Prentiss referred to him as "good man" Sean O'Stin, who said he was married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Stin told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter and that she was "inconsolable."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the newspaper San Herald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles told me that Prentiss had a hunting dog called Lightning, and that she dated Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his family at some point on Monday to say, "He's not going to jail."
On the evening of the same day, when the police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself.
According to a summary posted on the university website, Lamb received a Ph.D. in pedagogy from Delta State University in spring 2015.
Stars who lost their fortune
The actor (left), in a photograph with his son Redmond (right), has experienced several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-term life companion, Farra Fosette, who died of cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this has certainly played its part.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United left for a few months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost the PSV in Eindhoven.
While the advocate is concerned about this, which will prevent him from entering the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The trauma occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless 15-minute ride, when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV punishment zone.
He was treated in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day later, and then he'll be operated on.
It's terrible that a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, went through a lot of trouble and started playing fantastic, and then it happened.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months, and the guy can't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno's lucky he didn't get the red card and there was no penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli's Arbitrator didn't punish a Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge yourself when I say it's worth the penalty and the red card.
It was a very bad two-foot ride.
In his Twitter account, Shaw says, "Thanks to everyone for your messages, in words, not to describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I'll be back even more than I was."
Also on the subject of "Manchester United is going through a disaster with Luke Shaw in a game with PSV."
The British defender will have an additional incentive to recover from the European Championships in France next June.
Phillip Coca, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very severe injury."
When any player leaves with a trauma like this, everyone's very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to hurt the enemy.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gale at the 2014 World Championships.
"He's having a really hard time right now, because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it's a very severe injury, you don't feel well," says Coke.
I couldn't see the moment.
The only thing I could see was a ball that flew in the other direction, so it looked like it touched him, but I didn't see a ride under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to endure.
I'm very hard, and I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorex?
One thing every parent learns very quickly is that if your child likes a book, it will take a little while before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question from the representative of the holiday organization about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Lorex, an environmental fairy tale written by Dr. Suze in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, and Cameron wrote in a comment published on SuperCamps' website, and goes on to say, "This funny, touching, unusual story with a strong message, I like to read to my children because it always reveals some image or message that we're missing."
And everything would be fine, except the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to recapture the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of a film of the same name in 2012 with new characters and details added to diversify a rather short original narrative.
"In the high-walled city of Unnuzville, where there was no green and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girls of her dreams, fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," we read in the text a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Suze (the real name is Theodore Suze Geisel), who died in 1991.
If it doesn't seem suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a summary of the plot of the film "Lorax" posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high-walled city of Unnuzville, where everything was artificial and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart, the girl of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, admittedly an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about how a greedy tree-cuttinger and naddkins knitter destroys the environment, despite the protests of Loraks (whose name appears in the book's name) - a funny creature with a mustache who "speaks on behalf of the trees."
It is likely that such a simple PR task was assigned to an artist who had never read a child's book about Loraks 20 times in a row.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly received from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments were made.
There was clearly a risk for Adam Leet not to join England, but it's still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England picked out for this tour, I don't think it's likely that the 3-0 hit was repeated in the test series last time.
I wouldn't rule out victory in my field either.
Alistair Cooke's team may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are players in it, who are virtuosically accepting curveballs, and collective thinking is strong; they don't bring scars from 2012, but only youthful positive.
With Moun Ali's ball, he turns into a bowler pitching curveballs, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown test-level figure, is an attack option.
Also on the subject: Adam Leet dropped out of England for cricket test and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to expel Adam Leet, his head coach in Yorkshire, is, of course, difficult for me to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality was that cricket players were judged by the judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said it before) players choose themselves best.
A couple half-sotens, and Leeta could have waited for a longer career, but he was in the power of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there's another possibility.
The chief coach of the England team, Trevor Bayliss, spoke well of his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team player first, and then everything else.
The question of how long it's going to take before the test cricket batsman makes an impression is a difficult question.
Lite played seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton at nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play his or her own field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in his best shape, but this lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales is showing up, and he's a batsman I appreciate.
He's an unpredictable cricketer, which we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season, when he made 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those before him, but it will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would allow for the introduction of an extra spinner, keeping four fast bowlers, is thinking, and I'm not against it at all.
I don't see any reason why a punching player can't hit a ball there, and that left-handed girl already showed that he's a hell of a cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what he needs for his County Woostershire, but he's the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 "third batsman" test matches before coming out as the opening in 2001.
He won three hundred right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a back-up spinner, and when I spoke to him briefly, he seemed like a very promising young man.
People can look at his prime statistics -- an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky bet, but among spinners voting in favor, a little bit, and the pickers chose youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayauordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a master move.
He's one of the best guys for the game, and he's gonna bring in the wealth of experience he's got under all possible conditions and in any kind of attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the game where the white ball is used and will provide both energy and a merciless pace in the setup.
I've always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's a game or a coaching job, and, like Mahela, has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what they've said before, can give the team new strength.
Colly's colleague Darem Ben Stokes is left for one day, Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for one, have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, the coaches and the players who select the players do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
A British exit camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017.
David Cameron’s ill-considered policy of resuming negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is increasingly difficult every day, even without looking back at the election of genius Jeremy-"Is that a yes or a no?" - Corbin as a Labour leader or the TUC’s resentment about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that, in the current situation of the EU, a diverse crisis — not all of them of their own making — some of the participating countries have had enough of the British egocentric agenda of contriving concessions and undermining agreements that they largely do not want.
When he met in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided he didn't want them anyway if they were destroying social security.
We could even call it "selfie Dave and George's program."
The Premier and the Minister of Finance ride through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the background of a famous local monument, with or without a local celebrity company, then come home and say that they attract allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain’s interest in external contacts under the EU’s tenet – “Do not leave us with France”, says Berlin – suggests that the offshore ministers and officials in some capitals understand when they don’t care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious German Chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation deteriorates for her, as she deteriorated for those who stayed in her seat (11 years), Mitterrand (14 years) and Kolya (16 years).
France's head of France, François Hollande, is standing for re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing his power, too.
Poland may soon receive a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left.
It's hard to see them climbing out of their skin to help the Selfi-British, whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK, which they don't want either, because most people have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even plan to issue deliberately useless SNP-style remarcades during the British referendum campaign in 2017 to boost Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The revision was an idea-fix" and "Britania got nothing valuable from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans know at their peril how predatory Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical media magnates are of the EU, as opposed to Tony Benn’s 1975 referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a long-standing Euro-opportunist who was famous for his “direct EU bananas” of the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a plentiful company of fear-of-tax crooks, phone hackers and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had exactly the same opinion of them, but he was aware that when you were in a cage with a violent gorilla, you had to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and tea again.
Milliband was more committed to Blair than Blair himself in opposition to Cameron’s idea of a referendum, because Blair had fallen in favour of the repealed EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who had given him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him for any of this.
But the nice Jeremy Corbin who patted me on the back of a friend in Westminster on Monday -- I told him he didn't have time to spend it on me anymore -- looks like he's running the risk of repeating Neil Kinnok's "Merdock Boycott" strategy from the '80s-- a mistake both then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to interact with the press - not with me, but definitely with Andrew Marr, whose sofa he sat on on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist trend of Ukip and the wider group of “small England outsiders” among thori may say yes to that.
It's the same thing Hilary-Benn, but not Bennet-Benn said on radio and TV this week, and his inner Boy Scout refused to acknowledge that Corbin's appointment of obnoxious John McDonnell as the "black" finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father fought hard on TV for his disloyalty with colleagues in the Labour cabinet, without going too far or losing his office in the Cabinet.
Hilary's battle was more appealing.
But the struggle to stay “under all circumstances” – Ben's phrase – is not what McDonnell said, nor what J.C. told his peers and parliamentarians at a private meeting on Monday night, according to everyone.
Whatever he wants to tell the Democrat and "his boyfriend" Corbin -- remember, he touched me -- the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in a whirlpool of social networks, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It's wise not to let Cameron get away from Europe so easily, allowing him to accept as his due support for Labour during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbin’s basic misconception about EU membership – in the “bennitian” economy of the besieged fortress – is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism generated by minor differences is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about Nato - Tom Watson, it is unshakeable that J.K. will not campaign for exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to communicate this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on British concessions when it might all be meaningless?
The US is already very disappointed by the British’s weak military actions in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even though the Tori government is cutting costs, as I was reminded on Monday during lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize public health England's review of electronic cigarettes.
The government-funded agency stated that e-cigarettes were 95 per cent less harmful than smoking, and 12 people, some of whom were linked to the tobacco industry, reported by researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), together with Lancet, criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their e-cigarette report.
The PHE published an important report - a “turn milestone” last month, calling it “a comprehensive review of evidence”.
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the association of some experts with the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in Lancet's medical journal last month, they criticized the “extremely shaky argument” on the basis of which the PHE built its main conclusion.
In an article in the BMJ, two other researchers wondered whether the statements were “hard or shaky”.
Martin McKee, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: “The fundamental principle of health care - rules must be evidence of effectiveness.”
According to them, the public expects the PHE statements that “the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco” to be based on detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this emerges from the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a model for multi-criteria analysis of decision-making in order to synthesize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that the meeting was co-sponsored by a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also confirmed the BAT certificates in the health sector in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding he had reportedly previously received from Philip Morris, a tobacco company.
No reasonable explanation was given for the selection of board members, but there are several known e-citizen supporters, some of whom also claimed to finance the industry in publication.
It is not known if other meeting participants have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also visited by a tobacco director at the PHE.
The scientific article published by the group “finely agrees” that there is a lack of “substantial evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria” written by McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell reported that statements by the PHE that “there is currently no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, leading children or not smoking” are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of the PHE health and well-being service, said that the BMJ statements had previously been answered.
He said, "Electron cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All evidence suggests that threats to health from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term consequences.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is proved and what is not proved, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die a year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
Clearly, while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only do part of the harm caused by smoking, we do our job for the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 believes that BBC should stop the EastEnders series.
The former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop producing programs like EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would pay a lot for such successful shows as the Albert Planet soap opera.
Johnson observed that licensing fees should only be used to create programmes that are not produced by other British television and radio companies.
He criticized the BBC for placing public service announcements, which are probably only a small part of the audience watching, at peak airtime, when competitors have a high-profile show, and on channels like BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson observed that he had been unsuccessfully trying to work with BBC for six years while working at Channel 4.
“I can't help but think that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting programs that can be shown by competing non-subsidized companies,” Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee members as part of the investigation of the future of the BBC.
If you keep the license fee, which I don't think is a good solution in the medium and long term, then the company should keep only those programs that aren't produced and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice's show aired on the prime line because the creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea of no one else showing it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should be used to finance transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they are produced themselves.
Other channels would certainly pay a lot for it.
I don't understand how this could be a public service broadcast.
I don't think that would be any way to humiliate the BBC.
Serial businessman Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of pursuing ratings "because of staff ambition and their belief that this is the best way to get support for a long time".
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo those of Sky Executive Director Tony Ball, who, in his 2003 McTaggart Memorial Lecture in Edinburgh, suggested that BBC sell EastEnders series.
Johnson observed that higher-level BBC public service announcements “continue to go to BBC4, where it is often not possible to evaluate the audience, but the company's function is fulfilled, and this can be argued in preposterous sermons justifying the revenue from licence fees of £4 billion: “Well, of course, we do all these unexplained broadcasts that no one is watching.”
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee the following: “I encourage you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the most from it.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people who have 150 pounds for a lot of money, I wonder if they think so because they don't really watch and listen to BBC.
The former CEO of Sky and Channel 5, David Elstein, who also appeared before the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should reconsider Rita's mission in favour of "information, education and entertainment."
He noted that only a small proportion of BBC outputs were now formally classified as educational - he said it was 1 per cent of television content and 0.1 per cent of radio content - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the slogan “information, education and entertainment”.
On partnership issues, Elstein noted that BBC should make more efforts in areas such as Promenade Concerts (only some of them, he said, are on TV) and join alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available online.
Sopogenetics allows you to control brain cells with sound waves.
The video shows the nematodes changing direction as they are subjected to sound impulses.
Scientists have developed worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled using sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction as they are influenced by sound impulses too high to be heard by the human ear.
Impulse effects by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Also on the subject: Researchers use light to control brain activity
Scientists have said that worms demonstrate the possibilities of a new technique called saogenetics, which is to use ultrasound to excite certain brain, heart, and muscle cells, with the source of ultrasound located outside the body.
Sricant Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used in Parkinson's treatment.
The nematode worms usually do not react to ultrasounds, but Chalasani found that they started reacting when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves that then penetrate worms.
Strengthened ultrasonic waves affect structures called "TRP-4 ion channels" found in the membranes of certain worm cells.
Ultrasound waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells associated with them, as reported in Nature Communications.
To create a nematode that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to the worms, so their propulsion neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the application of ultrasound to modified organisms, sound waves were reinforced by microscopic bubbles and injected into worm organisms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that used in “optogenetics”, a new direction that allows scientists to switch on and off neurons with light pulses.
Chalasani argues that there may be some advantages to this method of sopognostics.
Unlike the light that goes to the right part of the brain through fiber-optics, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass through the body’s tissues unobstructed, so they do not have to pass through the skull box to be delivered.
“We believe that in order to treat some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can temporarily make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasonic signal”, Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
The forbidden torture equipment is right on your doorstep!
Advertisements mock the British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International's video protesting the gun show.
Amazing killer drones!
Ruining iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise truncheons that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The silent voice and the drawing of animation leave no doubt that this advert of the largest international arms exhibition is a cadaver parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government's intention to push weapons into repressive regimes by taking advantage of the ExCeL Exposition of Defence Technologies and Security Systems in Doclands.
Also on the subject: DSEI Arms Exhibition: authoritarian regimes are going to London
But a special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters on bus stops and subway trains, which demand to be looked at again.
"An important announcement on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" written on one of them in London Metro fonts depicting the DLR line, turning into a tank silhouette.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will come to the DLR line. Passengers are being asked to help stop the arms show.
300 posters were painted by artists who put their work on the "Museum of Cruel Design" in Banksy Desmaland Park.
A group called Special Patrol has helped to spread them around London using the “recruitment of a place breaker”, a 6-pound wrench of wrench keys, which is said to “access about a third of the advertising space at bus stops on the planet”.
London's transporters are not happy with this "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody ads issued by Special Patrol.
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibit and professor at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and eager to bring political art to the audience outside the galleries.
Many artists begin to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go to the real world for their art if they want to influence society.

The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by VCCP, working pro bono, with the help of a graphic designer and a sound artist who also works free of charge.
The creative director of VCCP, Matt Lever, was struck by the publicity surrounding the arms exhibit, with an ExCel pass, and thought, "Let's get them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create more realistic and sophisticated corporate advertising, but "filling it with brighter colors and animations has proved to be more exciting."
"They have been incredibly helpful in drawing attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
Now we need the British Government to take action to ensure that this torture equipment is not illegally sold at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of the ExCeL Arms Exhibition is from the inside, where participants trade fantastically euphemistically.
In a press release, Saab revealed information about an order for AT4CS RS to shoot off the shoulder from the U.S. Army.
It includes “an unparalleled cumulative charge that produces an unsurpassed effect inside the target”.

Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
It's been 11 years since I moved into a student hostel as a normal 19-year-old man still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the strained smiles of those I was irritating - and the many long complaints against others.
Most of what I've learned can be organized into eight simple rules.
Moving to a hostel can range from a mildly nerve - edgy to an absolutely frightening one.
He encourages you to talk to people about where you come from, whether you've taken an academic vacation and where you've spent it, whether you've supported Corbin and why you're "honestly, neither love, nor hate "Marmite," because seriously, guys, it's just yeast extract hahaha, I'm gonna be there."
Take a break.
And help others to rest, ask questions and show interest.
It keeps you talking and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking facilities, midnight cinemas, and parties, but they are also places where people dress and fix underwear.
Also on the subject: Don't even think about starting university when you're in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room is supposed to be a sanctuary, but many dormitories create a culture of swirling from room to room, which fosters friendship, communication, and long - term friendship.
It could be hell for someone who's trying to restore strength.
There's nothing in culture that lets you say, "I like you, and I want to keep being friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can restore the energy I've spent talking to you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of socializing and not knocking on his door, but sending a text message.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
One guy in my dorm was following the principle that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Make friends with pastries.
Since you're starting a university life at the peak of the Bake-Off show, knocking on the door to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies is no longer such a strange thing, not so much like the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I made you something, now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to be friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end, your face will probably be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, that depends on how good a baker you are.
Badly-moulded lumps of flour, sugar and fat would rather make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dorms.
Of course, stealing someone's chicken is stealing, but is it stealing to get some milk for tea?
Get through to the owner of the milk.
He's probably gonna ask you not to be shy, even if there's rage inside.
If someone's stealing your stuff, it's annoying, and I'm sorry, but try to treat it more mature than my roommate, who poured dishwasher into her milk to get revenge on those who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You don't have to make noises that prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you're the people in the glass house saying.
The girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to lower the sound of the drum and bass because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam this morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5 a.m., she graciously allowed him to sleep for two hours, and then turned on her music and locked the door behind her, taking a three-hour exam.
Was it not romantic for your future husband to settle in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, it wouldn't be extreme, until you bit your elbows, awkward, if you took a neighbor for your future spouse, got involved with him, broke up a relationship and had to see him every day, and maybe watch him pull all your mutual friends to his side?
Of course, you can't tell your heart, but if a hot neighbor is definitely not your future husband, try to cool your own heat a little bit.
At this exciting moment, when you realize that someone left the keys inside their locked room, the line between pranks and harassment is thinner than it looks.
A good prank is fun, but it turns into its opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something, but never get a room full of toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone else's door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you'll then put in the freezer, but don't glue other people's stuff with Blu-Tack to the ceiling more than two times.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on the iPhone after release of the Apple update
You can request a new operating system by entering the Settings application to select General and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you download it and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error message appears to tell them that "The application was not updated".
To avoid this, users are encouraged either to wait for the recovery to subside, or to try to upgrade through iTunes.
The clues on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process.
The process may include removing applications to increase space - but Apple minimized the probability of the action by reducing the update size, and also simplified the execution with a special tool that proposes to delete applications and re-establish them after the process has been completed.
It is worth making sure that your phone is charged or placed next to the charger to prevent the battery from being discharged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the discharge of the phone during the process could cause the update to fail.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity with a telephone call.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support that Moscow provided to President Assad only exacerbated the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk to a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia’s military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad poses the risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict and also has a negative impact on our common goal of combating extremism, unless we also continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power”, said the US State Department.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the US commitment to fighting the Islamic State in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member.
Moreover, the US “will welcome Russia's constructive role in trying to confront the Islamic State”.
Last Friday, representatives of the White House stated that they did not know exactly what the Russian forces were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the matter with Moscow.
However, White House press secretary Josh Ernest pointed out that the time for a telephone conversation between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet arrived: “When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit us, then he will pick up the phone and try to make that call.”
Barack Obama himself sees Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime as a “lost bet”.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake, that continuing to support Assad would only make things worse.
"But he did not heed my warnings - and as a result, the situation deteriorated," said the President of the United States.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to release temporarily imported yachts and other floating equipment for recreation and sports from customs duties and taxes.
The relevant changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Lashkin, reported this to Izvestom.
In June 2015, following a visit to Crimea, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, instructed a number of agencies - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Federal Security Service, the Russian Federation and the Russian Federation - to prepare proposals for the creation of an enabling environment for yachting in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, the experts note that the main problem is the total lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about €200 million are paid annually to European States for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on the amendment of the list of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes, providing for full conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes on imported yachts and other floating equipment for rest and sports.
According to the Ministry, this would certainly help to create an enabling environment for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, Laškina noted.
The matter was brought to the attention of the Sub-Commission on Customs, Tariff, Non-tariff, Protection Measures in Foreign Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also endorsed by the agencies.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure of full conditional release on entry was inherently a concession.
Therefore, after the adoption of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member States of the EEC, explained Lashkin.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary for the promotion of foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for applications in science, culture, cinema, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc. These include service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), measuring instruments, drilling equipment, costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skiing, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and religious objects.
In the press service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Izvestiam reported that it had prepared binding regulations for the seaports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provided for simplified procedures for the entry and exit of small, sporting sailing and recreational vessels to the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has instructed the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure the application of a simplified procedure for the entry of small-scale, sporting sailing and pleasure craft into and out of the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared draft regulations of the Government of the Russian Federation on the establishment of the boundaries of the seaports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, orders had already been issued, and the others were in the process of being agreed upon, as noted by the press service.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol are required to conduct State surveillance, classification and inspection, and State registration of small craft used for non-commercial purposes.
The problem is that in Russia it is because of the poor infrastructure that the yachting is very difficult.
If you look at southern Italy and France, it's a whole constantly growing industry that involves a lot of people.
In Russia, it's actually all standing still.
Our coast is not interesting, the only piece that can be exploited all year round is the Black Sea in the Sochi, Gelenjik, Novorossiysk, Anapa regions.
But the big problem is that in this area, the border police have very strict rules: in order to get out on a boat, a lot of permits have to be issued.
Besides, inside Russia, there's no place to fill up.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then there's a problem where to get it, says the sales director of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
With regard to yacht storage facilities, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have dedicated yacht hangars up to 30 m. The yachts are also being deposited in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers were rich, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts declined.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a $500 million loan.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
“New funding will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, the report states.
The World Bank’s Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Zimyao Fan, said that banking sector reforms would help to revive credit in the real economy and stimulate economic recovery.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank was witnessing early signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
Previously, the Polish government approved a loan to Ukraine of €100 million, transmitting to RIA News.
Prisons are asked to set up separate units for transgender people.
The Public Council of the Federal Service for the Enforcement of Sentences (FINS) for the Protection of the Rights of Convicted Persons will discuss, among other matters, the possibility of establishing separate units for transgender and transvestite inmates in the colonies in October 2015.
This was told by Board member Vladislav Grib.
In his view, depending on the total number of non-sex offenders in Russia, it was possible to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if there were many such criminals) in domestic prisons in the future to create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is only possible to determine whether citizens will serve their sentences in such isolated places once the convicted persons have undergone appropriate medical examinations which will prove that the perpetrator is indeed a person who identifies himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgender persons from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice worked successfully abroad: the remand centre (where the accused were held pending trial) had separate cells for transgender persons and special units in correctional facilities.
Today, it's the only way to deal with criminals like that.
Clearly, they need to be isolated, as the presence of transvestites and transgenders in regular cells is dangerous for them, suffering for their families and a sea of problems for the FIS.
The humiliation of trances on the part of fellow inmates is guaranteed,” says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big a city, how many criminals with an uncertain sex, you have to figure out where to distribute them.
There's no need for a separate SIZO - just the cells, the jail blocks.
Yeah, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgender people.
According to Gryb, 50 or 100 people could be held in the unit, and if a specialized unit was established in Russia alone, transsexual prisoners would be allowed to serve their sentences from any region.
Citizens are held in remand centres at the place where the crime was committed, so the admission of transvestites or transgender persons from other subjects during the investigation and trial is not realistic, but the establishment of such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes - considers the Mushroom.
As will be recalled, the day before, law enforcement officials were unable to determine whether the detainee, male or female, had been identified for possession of drugs by 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kojukov (known as Alina Davis), and a man with a female appearance was not arrested.
He's been released home under a non-departure subscription.
This news has been widely discussed on social media and in the media, as the mechanism for holding transgender persons in remand centres and colonies in Russia is not yet in place.
Russian human rights defender, LGBT activist (LGBT lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolai Alekseyev, supported the idea of creating special places for transgender people to serve their sentences, noting that it was also possible to identify persons in colonies abroad, male or female, depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, just like the issue of prison security for homosexuals, says Aleksei.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be made for that and homosexuals, especially since there were more of them in prison than transgender people.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to impersonate themselves as transsexuals in order to enter a different colony from a normal one.
Of course, you can introduce a medical examination before putting people in colonies for transgender people, but it's not always clear.
For example, in the United States, one of Chelsea Menning's inmates looked like a man, and already in prison, he said he wanted to change sex, said Alexeyev.
A person can feel like anything.
But as long as there are no separate places for transgender people to serve their sentences, I doubt that the prison staff will seriously consider the safety of such people and learn the subtleties of their orientation or sexual identity.
At the same time, the international reproductive health expert in the territory of the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders in the colonies could greatly delay the beginning of the sentence of convicted prisoners.
A commission is being set up - it's a matter of sexology, psychiatrists do long-term observations, it's not just one test on which a high-precision opinion is based.
Today's mental health powers allow that.
Therefore, even before a change of gender, potential patients always undergo such tests - they clearly show whether a change of sex with surgical intervention is a necessary measure,” says Lord Kipanidzee.
However, it is difficult for me to see how this system can be implemented in relation to convicted persons, since on average it takes a month.
The doctor, while generally supporting the idea of establishing separate units for transsexuals, also doubts whether, in the current economic conditions, it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical expertise, to transgender units in Russia.
It's hard to calculate, there's no official statistics, but considering that there's about 5% homosexuals in Russia, you can say that there's even fewer transgender people, and there's only a small number of people who do this and commit crimes, says Lordkipanidze.
At present, upon application to the administration of the colony, homosexuals and transgender persons can obtain separate conditions of detention.
Michael Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
In Hunty-Mansiysk, the world championship for chess among juniors ended until the age of 20.
The end of the first was more than intriguing.
The winner decided only in the last round, and became a Russian, Mikhail Antipov, who managed to catch up with the Polishman, Jan-Kshishtof Doudu, who seemed confidently on his way to the title.
The girls' victory was celebrated by the Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buchs.
The World Chess Championship, held in Hunty Mansiysk from the beginning of September, seemed to have lost almost all intrigue by the middle of the tournament, as Poland’s representative, Jan-Kshishtof Douda, who issued a series of four victories (the Swiss 13-round competitions) was confidently taking over the leadership.
Given that Douda was a top-notch ranking, and is generally considered to be one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he would miss the break-out seemed very low.
And even when Douda slowed down and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the gap to only 0.5, he remained a clear favorite in the title struggle.
After all, Antipov had to win the 13th round to catch the leader.
But even that wouldn't help if you won Douda's party.
Plus this compulsory victory, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov managed to avoid them.
He did well with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he had to wait for Douda to complete his party, meeting with Benjamin Bock.
Fortunately for Antipov, a Polish chess player has made a stand against a Dutch man in a draw.
Thus, Antips and Douda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best extra scores.
Therefore, it is to him that the leadership of the Hunta-Mansian Autonomous District, whose Governor Natalia Komarova, has traditionally devoted a great deal of attention to the development of chess in the region, has been awarded the main prize.
But the girls' competition didn't have an intriguing ending.
The leader of the tournament, Natalia Buxe (Ukraine), was enough to win the title not to lose in the final round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russian woman Alina Bivol prevented her from catching up with Bucks.
The Russian athlete stayed second to the 0.5-point champion.
It changes the regional structure.
The company combines the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East into the East region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As Michael Sloboddin, CEO of Wimpelcoma, pointed out, changes are being made to “stay a strong player in the market”, to develop a company “in a new, not always favourable external environment”.
In an interview with Russia 24 Mr. Sloboddin said that they intended to reduce the “ten percent” of Russian staff.
Rospetnadzor checked 78 Moscow Burger King diners and issued 367 orders.
As a result, a restaurant on the Volokolam highway was fined 50,000 roubles, and the facility on Grand Tula Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after all violations had been corrected.
Forty-three diners violated space requirements.
Among other violations, the poor sanitation and hygiene of the premises and the non-compliance with ventilation requirements have been detected in some facilities by the bacteria of a group of intestinal sticks.
The franchise on the Burger King brand is owned by Burger Rus, owner of the Shocolate Network of Alexander Kolobov, and there are 293 diners in Russia.
Igor Artemiev, head of the FAS, stated that the agency was opposed to 10% indexation of freight tariffs and State subsidies, as requested by the OAO RZD.
At first they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and also a multibillion dollar budget subsidy, he says.
We say it's wrong, it's too much, cut your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money on the left and the right.
He added that the FAS had its own “more stringent” proposals, which were currently being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net settlement option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of a $300 million share-sharing option, was reported by a gold mining company.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the price of issuing shares in favour of Sumeru and market quotations), which can be taken from the free flow of money.
Sumeru has time until October 3 to implement the option or demand additional payments.
The details of the Polymetal negotiations don't open.
The option was negotiated as part of the purchase of the Polymetal project Kyzyl in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Department of Housing Policy of the Ministry of Housing, reported that the Ministry was working with the Central Bank to develop a procedure for the sanitation of developers.
“We understand that we're not going anywhere, so we're working on a mechanism,” said the official.
Scripts of Citizen Kane are going to be tendered.
Representatives of the auction house Profiles in History reported on plans to tender draft versions of the "Citizen Kane" script, which is considered to be one of the best works of director, writer and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will begin in Calabas on September 29, and will present three draft versions of the script, each of which is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $30,000, and delivers the AP.
The first of the drafts, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevich, is the earliest script in private collections, and is entitled "American" - the working name of the film.
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, and the third is the final plan of the film.
Minpromtorg: Targeted food aid will not be the equivalent of cards in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Evtukhov, said that the targeted food aid programme would not be the same as the food distribution card system in the USSR.
These include modern targeted food aid to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food card."
I would like to point out in particular that there is no need to confuse the proposed product maps with the repertoire of past total shortages, the distribution card system in which the quantity of products received is regularized.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the law," the TASS quotes Mr. Evtukhov's words.
Previously, IA wrote that the program to introduce food cards for the poor is in the government.
For more information on the Minpromtorg initiative, read IE's "Igor Shuvalov commissioned the production of food cards."
The president of Rosgosstraha wants to divorce his wife.
A source familiar with the situation informed RAPSI that Danil Khachathurov, the president of the insurance company Rosgosstrach, had filed a suit with the Moscow court for the dissolution of the marriage with designer Uljana Sergienko.
Court of Justice No. 100 will take up the case on 16 September.
Danil Khachathurov asks that his marriage be dissolved and that the joint property be divided.
The court confirmed the existence of a divorce claim in the proceedings, noting that the division of property had not been, and would be, brought before a district court.
President Alexander Bobreshov is leaving his post.
Aleksandr Bobreshov, Vice-President of the Russian Railways (RZD) Corporate Security Company, leaves the company, reports Interfax, referring to the source.
Vice-Premier of Russia, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the RZD Arkady Dvorkovic, stated that the issue of the departure of Alexander Bebrešov from the RZD had been initiated by the new head of the company, Oleg Belozerov.
According to the Vice-Premier, the reshuffles in the management of the RZD are not related to the change of the head of the company.
Formerly, IA reported that Vladimir Yakunin OAO RZD was led by the First Deputy Minister of Transport, Oleg Belozerov, who was in charge of the financial unit.
For the first time, the new head of the company announced reforms in the monopoly: in a year and a half, a new system of freight tariffs will be put in place.

This year, a study by the Association of Russian Managers “Top 1000 Russian Managers” is released for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of top-level Russian managers, the study takes stock of the work of Russian managers over the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the winners of last year's ratings.
Last year's winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for this year's ranking and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial roster is invited to nominate up to 10 new managers from other companies, who would be useful to add to the pool of candidates.
The following executives of the company ' s functional areas may be nominated: Financial Director, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, Staff Director, IT Director, Social and Corporate Relations Director, Government Relations Director, Corporate Governance Director.
Each proposed expert manager is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate a management team and up to 10 new managers from other companies.
Industry-based nominations are based on the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forest and timber processing, engineering, media, metallurgy, multidisciplinary holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, consumer services and production, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to access www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see the information on the remaining participants and can present their estimates according to the criteria proposed for each functional area.
The rating methodology is based on the “best picks the best” principle: top managers rate top managers, functional managers rate functional managers.
Such a principle provides the highest possible level of authenticity for the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final ratings are approved by expert commission meetings.
All interested candidates for this year ' s ratings and repeated candidates for past ratings are invited to face-to-face meetings of the expert commissions.
The commissions are organized on the functional basis of: the commission for the approval of the list of top managers and the eight commissions for the approval of the heads of functional areas.
At expert commission meetings, it is proposed that the lists submitted be approved in alphabetical order (places remain strictly on the Internet and are classified information prior to publication of the rating) or that updates be made to the list of stand-by candidates attached.
The names of the companies are in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the rules of IO.
At the time the rating is published, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
Comfort rate for investment credit is 10-13%.
Experts estimate that the market for credit for small and medium-sized businesses fell by 40 per cent between January and April this year.
What do you estimate the situation is today?
After the panic of late 2014 - early 2015, lending to HCMs declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
The 25-30% annual credit was not profitable for anyone.
If the bank could have put all of its possible problems into a higher rate in the future, from delays to non-returns, it is impossible to do so now: the stakes are already cloudy.
For business, the current rate of HCMs is uncomfortable.
For much of the investment projects, the current level is not acceptable in terms of return.
A rate of 10-13% would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns.
How do you estimate that the demand of entrepreneurs for credit is met?
The situation has improved slightly since the interest rate was reduced by the Central Bank.
Credit resources have become more readily available.
However, according to our observations, clients have been less likely to apply for loans.
In the first place, business does not understand its development prospects and future revenues.
Today, business has one option: it is necessary to learn to work by looking at today’s economic situation in the country and the region.
There is a need to monitor current results more closely, to monitor cash flows.
At the same time, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy costs, subject to the availability of financial resources.
All of this ultimately allows the company to make products more competitive and to keep business even in a volatile economic situation.
What are the major trends in the lending market for HCMs that will strengthen and influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for the reduction of the average rate will depend largely on the Central Bank policy, and the regulator is now showing consistency in the reduction of the key rate.
However, a drastic fall in the lending price for HCMs is not worth waiting for.
In the current situation, inflation is primarily a problem that requires a higher interest rate to generate real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even if the rates of the CD are reduced.
In terms of the level of delay, traditionally small and medium-sized business companies, limited both in their ability to replenish money and in their options for correcting economic behaviour, would certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country ' s economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how the word Mazda is written with Japanese hieroglyphics.
Beautiful, concise, and at the same time quite difficult for those who are used to Cyrillic or Latin.
And so is the new CX-5 crossover, as is any other brand model: without dazzling, attractive on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
Japanese, simply because of its “Japaneseness,” can bring the attachment to the products of the rising sun country to a state of complete delight.
You can make as many arguments as you want in favor of cars from other countries, and a man will even agree with those arguments in principle, but the whole conversation is being spread out from the final phrase, "But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only technology, but everything else Japanese.
Quoting Basa from the pace, making food for Wasabi, collecting katanas, and dressing your girlfriend--no, not in kimono, of course, but in the canons of Japanese street fashion: nice, creative, and quite unexpected.
Perhaps the Japanese school uniform is the only one that girls wear with pleasure after school.
It has amazing properties, both sensual and rigid.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is a radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But the image of the car is much more changed by the new pattern of the headlights and the rear lamps, by which the car is immediately recognized in the traffic flow.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensual, but its appearance is severe.
You don't have to call the police.
CX-5, one of the safest things in the world, can only be tested by Japan’s stoic calm.
A 2.2 litre diesel engine produces a high torque over a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine, with a capacity of 175 hp - only 5.9 l, is combined with an exclusively automatic transmission and a full drive.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
To add a bit of black humor to this image, you can choose a print legging from the Not Cross police tape.
However, Mazda did their best to keep you from driving your own CX-5 accident.
In order to further improve comfort while maintaining excellent control, the suspensions were re-engineered with front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimizing the shape of the lower arm housings.
The full drive system has been adapted to Russian conditions.
High speed road and engine noise has been reduced by 13 per cent.
A swimsuit in a flower or strip is as boring as a budget sedan.
It's different if a girl walks in a bathing suit with an original drawing.
For example, from a role-playing video game.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved structure for both front and rear seats, providing an optimal reserve of space for both broad shoulders and long legs - who has what.
Longfoots will certainly appreciate that the thrusts in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and don't hit the ankles in the swivels.
The widest range of Mazda active security systems is proposed at CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to detect a potential threat.
There's also adaptive lighting, and a warning to get off the lane, and monitoring dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
Comfortable, with minimum projections, shall carry a load of 561 litres. Rear seats shall be folded in a 4:2:4 proportion, each section being equipped with a separate carry-on, and shall increase the baggage compartment to 1,560 litres.
The cartoon hero's suit in Japan is called Kigurumy.
It's especially spicy for kigurami pajamas.
There's nothing in it!
Of course it's bedtime.
But also, entertaining little kids.
Or just walking around on the street like that...
I mean, it's so great to have a choice-- cool clothes, behavior, or a car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the material, Kawaicat.
Kiev tore up the atomic fusion.
Kiev has officially formalized Ukraine's refusal to cooperate with Russia in the construction of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The Supreme is pleased to have voted Wednesday after the second attempt to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the completion of the third and fourth clusters were signed as early as 2010-2012, but the project could not be started.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law terminating an agreement concluded between 2010 and 2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of a third and fourth block on the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant.
The bill introduced by the Government had been passed only with a second vote, with 210 deputies voting for the first time, with a minimum of 226, but 234 members of Parliament voting for the draft.
The initial project of the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant under the USSR was to consist of four units of 1 GW each with HEV-type reactors, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the completion of the project led to an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and Rada passed relevant laws in 2011-2012.
Since there was no budget for Ukraine, it was anticipated that the building of the blocks would have to be on credit from the Russian side, but the funds had never been allocated.
Following the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to close relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing a refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant and on a project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations remained was the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for the existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (which provided about half of the electricity generation in the country), since the Ukrainian ANCEX “Energoat” had so far not been able to replace Russian supplies.
The plans to build the Khmelnitska nuclear power plant with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: as far back as 2014 in Kiev, negotiations were announced with Czech Skoda JS.
The UN General's Office is opposed to the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the press conference that the situation in Syria cannot be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution," quotes AP as his answer to a question about Russian military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also announced that he would meet with the Foreign Ministers of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Nikolai Bogdanovski, reported that the General Staff did not rule out the possibility of establishing an air force base in Syria in the future.
There's no such plan yet.
"But things may be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Formerly, IA reported that the US does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to combat the terrorist group “Islamic State” banned in the Russian Federation.
For more information on US doubts about Russian aid to Syria, read "I" in "Russian military presence in Syria concerns Washington."
In the PA, OSCE reports a possible meeting of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), Arthur Gerasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in south-eastern Ukraine.
“What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations”, the TASS quotes Mr. Gerasimov's words.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and for “re-entry into normal life for our countries”.
Asked whether, in his view, dialogue between Ukraine and Russia was currently possible at the parliamentary level, in a “normand format” or in a contact group format on the OSCE PA site, Mr. Gerasimov observed that the dialogue had taken place and that there were Minsk agreements.
At the same time, politicians say that in Kiev they support all kinds of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, former President Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics had not fundamentally changed their positions in the tripartite talks, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties have been given mandates.
Yesterday, the electoral commission of Nizhny Novgorod summarized the results of the municipal Duma elections by municipal district, allocating 12 seats on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral irregularities have been raised by representatives of CRC, who accused the victim of “covering the counterfeit”.
The opposition ' s comments were not accepted.
In addition, the Communist Party of Russia refused to organize a referendum on the abolition of the cost of capital repairs to apartment buildings.
The town beater officially presented the election results to the proud Nizhny Novgorod in the municipal constituency.
A total of 1.03 million voters were included in the electoral rolls in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand voters were cast in the district commissions and 268,000 voters voted in the elections.
More than 11,700 ballots were declared invalid and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties depending on the votes they received.
According to the One Russia lists, six seats in pride are held by Dmitry Swatkowski, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasili Shupranova, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rastovaev and Igor Nagornom.
The only mandate of the LDPR was given to the leader of the party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the CPRF are divided between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of "Just Russia" are assigned to Alexander Rasumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
These candidates must now decide within five days whether they will serve as deputies in the city Duma: if the mandate is withdrawn, they will proceed to the next candidate on the list.
The Chairman of Gorizbirkoma, Alexander Makeev, informed the commission that he was putting on duty for “telegrams of Zhirinovsky and others” to relinquish mandates.
In approving the election report, the representatives of CRC reported multiple violations.
A member of the Gorizbirkom, with the right to a consultative vote of CRCF, Leonid Krasnokutsky, proposed not to recognize the vote in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that the head of the Sormovsky District Administration had ordered the closure of the entrance to the administration building, where the four district commissions were located.
Neither the Udma nor the candidates nor the observers could have gone inside for a long time, and a high-profile storming scandal with the doors of the administration was broadcast on television.
All observers and members of consultative commissions were able to attend the meetings of district commissions.
They were not allowed access by the head until after the voting had ended and the district commissions had not yet arrived to issue their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the chapter was corrected, and the persons concerned could attend all the meetings," the member of the mountain beat up Natalia Andrushin.
The Communists objected that in the blocked administration building, a deputy was illegally detained for more than four hours in the town hall of Ludmila Aristov, on which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition also resented the fact that in a number of UIRs on election day, the ballot papers were sealed at 6-7 in the morning.
However, the members of the advisory committees and observers had not been notified, so they had already arrived at the election at 8 a.m.
The Communists are confident that in the morning before the opening of the polling stations, ballot papers could be thrown into the ballot boxes uncontrollably.
However, the mountains, which had already dealt with more than 124 complaints on various occasions, had found no irregularities in the missing ballots, according to Alexander Makeev.
Nor did the members of the commission support the proposal of Maria Popova, a colleague from Fair Russia, to issue, through an oiblic, amendments to regional legislation to clearly set the time for opening of early ballot envelopes, which would then enter the urn.
"As an initiative of your own, go to the CEC," suggested Mrs. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, the President was loudly accused by a member of CRCF, Sergei Samohin, who shouted that he ignored dozens of complaints and covered up election fraud.
"You're not here at the rally, be careful." The president of the birchhouse is offended.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the general results of the elections are to be confirmed by the Beaver, after which the first meeting of the 6th City Duma of Nizhny Novgorod will be scheduled for three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the municipal electoral commission refused to register the initiative group for the local referendum of the Communists of Russia.
According to the documents, the parties were going to bring to the discussion two questions: whether they agreed that the fees for the renovation of apartment buildings should be “immediately lifted” and that the tariffs for housing and utilities should be “freeze until 2020”.
However, the lawyer of the Duma, Irina Maslova, explained that the application of the Communists of Russia was contrary to the law.
FedEx revenue is mixed, decreasing forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported on the disappointing results of the last quarter, and the giant delivery service reduced the forecast of annual profits due to the fall in demand for freight services and increased costs in its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it planned to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares were reduced by approximately 2.5 per cent in pre-bids 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. announced that it planned to earn $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous projection.
Analysts estimated $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast is declining despite an average rate increase of 4.9 per cent, which will come into effect on 4 January, and the increase in land freight charges for heavy or bulk cargo, which begins in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase revenue over the previous year, owing to lower expenditures, higher gross income and increased online trade.
The Chairman and CEO, Fred Smith, said that the company “worked steadily in view of the weak outlook for economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
Workforce plans for holidays were announced the day after the competitor's application, UPS, that they were planning to hire an additional 95,000 employees, approximately the same number they hired last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than the year before.
The share earned $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 per share, which was surveyed by 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5 per cent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been affected in recent years by a recession in the international fixed-term transport sector, resulting in a lack of growth in gross income in its express transport unit.
However, the Internet shopping boom dramatically improved the FedEx Ground results.
Land transport revenues increased by 29 per cent in the last quarter, but operating revenues remained largely unchanged due to higher costs of large departures and self-insurance.
The Express Unit earned higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector income fell due to higher labour costs.
In pre-bids about an hour before the opening of the stock exchange, FedEx stock dropped by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling by 11 per cent a year and 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
At the most anticipated meeting of several years, Federal Reserve leaders will spend two days this week at the 27-foot table of Honduran redwood, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At one end of the richly decorated meeting room, a wall image of the United States will hang over them two floors high.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank received a double commission from Congress to maximize employment in the United States and keep stable prices there.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third unwritten assignment: financial stability.
And this third assignment may prove to be an unknown factor in the almost predicted decision that will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most data show strong economic growth, recent shocks in global financial markets may deter already cautious Federal system leaders from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds - even by a quarter of a percentage point.
“It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject to be considered,” says Lindsay M. Piegza, Chief Economist of the Brokering Company Steel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise the stakes that increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself provokes financial market fluctuations.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted that interest rates would rise this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to keep it from doing so, with a key indicator showing only about 30 per cent of the probability of a rapid recovery.
This may lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal System raises the stake, provided that decision makers do not mitigate the blow by promising that the next increase will not take place soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was triggered by expectations that the policymakers of the Federal System’s strategy would leave a bet this week,” said John Lonsky, the chief economist of Moody’s Capital Markets Research.
"It will be a surprise if the Federal System raises the stakes at this point in time," he observed.
If the Federal Reserve authorities do this, "they're going to have to go a long way in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don't panic."
Other experts objected that a higher rate could calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal System seemed to be leaning to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, taking the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of US recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she expected a higher rate this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost at the level considered full employment in the Federal System.
Wage increases show signs of acceleration.
While inflation continues to fall below the central bank’s annual target of 2 per cent, the Federal System’s management stated that the key reason was the temporary effect of the sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates, and needs them, given the decline in the labour market,” observed Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world started shaking at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones average equity index for industrial companies fell by as much as 16% relatively high in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in China’s economy could hinder global growth.
The market recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve, market outrage further complicates difficult calculations of the interest rate increase.
“In the absence of information on what happened in the financial markets and the news of China’s weakness in the past few weeks, they would have been twisting nuts at the meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior UCLA researcher Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve employee.
He now predicts that they will wait for at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is a great deal of uncertainty as to what the impact on the American economy may be, and they have little reliable data after recent events in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal System and should not be taken into account technically in these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve has become a global financial power.
The impact of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
Just a hint from the then president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could “slow down” its monetary expansion has created turmoil in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve system would not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other Headquarters banks and experts in order to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is “earlier art than science”, noted Zachary Karabelle, the head of Envestnet Inc., a company that deals with global health management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, president of Richmond Federal Reserve, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve, there have been instances of excessive reactions to financial market movements that seem to be unrelated to economic principles.”
Lacker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who insisted on raising the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis led the Federal System to reduce its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three sessions, “despite the limited identifiable impact on growth in the US”, said Lacker.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System lifted these cuts.
The federal reserve system should only take precedence over stability in times of major crises, such as the 2008 market collapse,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest-rate committee.
The last panic didn't get close to that level, he said.
"You wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're afraid of rising rates because markets are in shock," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute of World Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to have a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should be ahead of events.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/store was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells for the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Ty Town.
A market/store is a shop where you can buy all at once, offering a dizzying choice of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even a car department if you need to buy engine oil.
The store's huge, and it's gonna take more than an hour to comb through all the rows.
If shopping makes you hungry, buy food at the LAX-C BBC Express.
The culinary department in the store (good and inexpensive) is close to the cashier’s office and offers various options for taking out.
What's the proposal: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Prices of reasonable goods, and quite a lot of goods are sold in bulk.
Fresh products include delicacy Asian and local Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat counter is as diverse as the fish counter staff will clean and cut the fish, and even fry it for you if you want.
A large part of the store is placed under the impressive freezer, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter pumpkins and galangals, ducks in their entirety, fish, beef blood and gallstone, pig carcasses, caviar, local sausage, semi-finished, and so on.
Who buys it? Restaurant owners and chefs, and families and individual buyers.
There are both shopping carts and forklifts in the wide passage.
Foundka: A fresh durian montong near the exit.
The store is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, adjacent to the outskirts of the Chinese quarter and the business center of the city, a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own site, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although there may be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually easy to find.
The Speaker of the State Duma, Sergei Narishkin, admits that the US will deliberately destabilize the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees may rush into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this view to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a supporter of conspirological theories, but the question goes without saying: is it not Europe the ultimate goal of those who, with such manic perseverance in recent years, have destabilized the countries of North Africa and the Middle East?” he asked.
“I'm sure someone thought and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who are fleeing death, would rush to the prosperous countries of the EU,” he added.
Narishkin asked: “Do many European political leaders have spoken frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is now literally engulfing their countries?”
"No, old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers to remain silent," he said.
According to Narishkin, NATO flouts many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially watched and watched how the military boots, sewn by NATO standards, are also trampling on moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law”, the speaker stressed.
Government forces and their loyal militias are opposed by insurgents made up mainly of Islamists.
Subsequently, the terrorist group Islamic State, banned in Russia, joined the opponents of the Syrian Government.
The U.S. supports insurgents who are opposed to both Assad and IS.
Official Damascus considers such insurgents to be terrorists.
The President of Syria has identified the cause of the West’s aversion to Russia.
Western claims against countries such as Syria, Russia, and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
This view was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not accept partners or sovereign States.
In those countries, he wished to remove one person and place another in his place, who would act in the interests of Western countries rather than in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to a sharp turn of the Western media with the beginning of a coup in Ukraine.
To them, he said, Russian President Vladimir Putin “has turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a king, a dictator, who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came to power in an undemocratic way, despite being elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West’s constant statements that Assad himself should go away, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he did, at the people’s request, not by decision of the United States, the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
“If the people want them to stay, the president stays, otherwise they should leave immediately”, he stressed.
Assad described Russia and Iran as friendly countries and recalled that they were cooperating with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
Referring to Iranian military support, the Syrian leader observed that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, the economy and the military.
He denied the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
“There is naturally an exchange of military expertise between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place”, he explained.
For the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if we are serious about combating terrorism.
“We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-ihil coalition led by the United States,” Assad pointed out.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000 and the number of refugees 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group Islamic State, which is banned in Russia.
An international coalition led by the United States strikes against IG positions from the air.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
US Secretary of State John Kerry had a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov.
Reuters reports this with reference to John Kirby's State Department spokesman.
It is noted that the subject of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any additional details.
At the same time, he stated that the US had tools for “further isolation of Russia” if it supported Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, transmitting RIA News.
According to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lavrov, in his conversation with Kerry, again emphasized the need to create a united front against terrorist groups operating in the territory of that country.
Ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis and possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula were also discussed.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Previously, United States officials stated that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern over the increased Moscow support for Assad.
Washington stated that if Russia continued to support Assad, it would be further isolated from the international community.
In response, Russian press secretary Dmitry Peskov stated that the country would not be subjected to international isolation.
The rebels are in favour of overthrowing the Assad regime.
A terrorist organization, the Islamic State, has seized part of the territory.
The U.S.-led international coalition has exposed IG positions to air strikes.
Beardai called information in the American newspaper a slander against the Arrow.
The former President of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
That's what he told Lenta.ru in his phone interview.
The note in Washington Post is beautiful because it's completely redacted.
Former DNR Defence Minister Igor Strelkov, of course, did not tie up and "get out" him from the Republics of Donbas in a very uplifted mood, no ropes, no three-fur money attributed to him by different characters," he noted.
According to Beaurodai, it was really about the Arrow in a conversation with a reporter in an American newspaper.
"Yes, I said that the Arrow was urgently required to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former head of the DNR government.
Bearodai stressed that he did not know why the American correspondent decided to write that the Arrows had been taken to Russian territory as “linked”.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it's not provocation, it's an amazingly misunderstood word, because I stressed that the Arrows left on their own," Borodai observed.
"It's slander against both me and the Arrow," he concluded.
Previously, an article appeared on The Washington Post that quoted beardas saying that he had forcibly taken Strelkov to Russian territory.
According to the newspaper, Borodai noted that he had been forced to tie up his companion.
The Polish authorities have begun to search for a Nazi gold train.
The Polish loggers began cutting trees over an underground tunnel, where there is some evidence of a Third Reich gold train.
Work started on Tuesday, September 15, reporting Reuters.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to verify the reliability of the rumours of the railroad with the treasures.
There may be arms and precious minerals inside the train.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Nizhnesilese Voivodeship, Tomaz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence of a gold train was no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cordon the search area.
Three days earlier, the Polish Deputy Minister of Culture, Peter Zhukhovski, had stated that local treasure detectors with a “99 percent probability” had found the same train with the Third Reich gold that was described in legends.
Zhukhovski pointed out that if the assumptions were confirmed and the jewels found, they would become the property of the state treasury, and the treasure would not be handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of a law firm reported to the Polish city of Walbzih that they had found a train in a sealed tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The chief drug addict of the Russian Federation has proposed that the sale of tobacco to persons up to the age of 21 should be prohibited.
Russia’s main drug addict has proposed to ban the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Yevgeny Brun noted that until this age “any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is particularly harmful”.
That's what he said on live radio station Goskot Moskva, commenting on the fact that Speaker Sovfed Valentin Matvienko supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21.
Man is growing unevenly.
You can be in the army from the age of 18 when you're physically ready.
Mentally, he's been ready for a full life in society since he was 21.
"It is known from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, is only fully matured by the age of 21," Brun noted.
In the past, Sultan Hamzaev, a member of the Public Chamber and head of the Triple Russia project, told Izvesdam that Matvienko had supported an initiative to raise the age limit for the sale of alcohol and “agreed to raise the issue again with the Public Chamber at the upper house of Parliament”.
According to the activist, a working group will soon be set up in the Federation Council to draft a draft law under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible has been asked to check for compliance with the Law on Information Protection of Children
The resident of Novosibirsk requested the Regional Prosecutor's Office to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law “On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development”, and the statement was read on 16 September by Sib.fm.
On 26 August 2015, the author stated that he had purchased a Bible from the Chinese City Store on the Red Prospect, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his view, violated the “Protection of children from information harmful to their health and development”.
On 16 September, the application was accepted by the Prosecutor's Office of Novosibirsk.
Novosibirsk will receive a response within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
Much more interesting is the absurdity of the law itself,” the complainant commented to Sib.fm, a correspondent.
Besides, it's a very fundamental problem that's going to stir up society.
It will start to reread the Bible, which it has never done before.
Brazilian Riu Grande Paediatrics Union promotes healthy breastfeeding feeding
The Brazilian Paediatric Organization SPRS has developed a scandalous method to convince women of the need for adequate nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves the display of images of babies sucking on breasts that are captured by images of harmful food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
In view of the high energy needs, it is recommended that pregnant women and women who give birth should increase the daily calorie rate by approximately 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one increase in calories is not the only change in diet that mothers must make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor at Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy nutrition for pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents tumors from developing.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child ' s immune system has been identified.
Under Hamburg, the train ran a school bus.
In the vicinity of Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on the train track.
A 23-year-old woman driver, realizing that she could not move off the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, they saw a collision.
One of the high school kids caught it on video.
An emergency caused panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the side of the road.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was miraculously injured except one passenger of the train who was slightly injured.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300,000 euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in a fight with the Filipino, Carlo Magali.
The battle for one of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category of up to 57.15 kg on Friday ended with the victory of Magali knockout in the 12th round.
Brown got into the hospital with a cranial trauma.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life support machine.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended in a draw.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second death among Australian boxers in six months.
In March, Braydon Smith, a 23-year-old student, died of injuries sustained in the ring.
AMA now recommends that this sport should not be used, but rather that it should be banned at all.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally,” says the vice president of the organization, Steven Parnis.
But as boxing now exists, there will always be situations in which an athlete gets haemorrhage or brain injury, leading to either death or severe damage.
For that reason, the AMA believes that we cannot continue living with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, Sergei Naryshkin, said that the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians was unacceptable.
He stated this by addressing the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We view this as unacceptable action, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“This should not be repeated because it is a manifestation of political shame and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue”, said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to re-establish the Russian-EU partnership.
Let's put morality back in politics.
Let us restore dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us restore humanist ideals to a democratic world order.
"Duality never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
“First, a negotiated solution to the Ukrainian crisis and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group”, Naryshkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE must be commended.
"It's almost the only common ground where people are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
It will be recalled that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until 18 September.
Enjoyed the win for a couple of days.
The world champion of light athletics, Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be described as triumphant for a 24-year-old tracker from Barnaul, Sergei Shubenkov.
He managed to win at his 110-metre coronary with barriers in Europe’s command, set several records and, above all, become the world’s champion, the first national barrier sprint in history.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Diamond League, taking third place.
The New News has asked Shubenkov to share his impressions from the passing season.
Sergei, is the season not over for you?
Yeah, I'm going to play at the World War Games that will be held in October in Korea, and then I'm going to be thinking about my vacation.
It's true, I'm going home to prepare now, in Barnaul, and being home is still a very different condition.
It's easier than running around the world every week.
You once said autumn was your favorite time of year.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a beautiful time.
The passions after the season's main start have receded, the weight of responsibility no longer squeezes.
We could have a little fun at the "dreaming" thing.
Plus, you know, the vacation's coming up soon...
Are you tired?
After all, it's a special season, a lot of positive emotions...
Fatigue always accumulates at the end of the season.
It doesn't matter what you did more, win or lose.
Every competition is stress.
Regular flights, moving around, it's not like there's no trace for the body.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But right now, I've got emotions on the rise.
Well, I'm just happy.
By the time you finished at the Beijing World Cup, do you come back often?
It happens.
And you journalists won't let me forget about it.
But in general, I think it's bad for a sportsman who lives on his old victories to run his successful races over and over again.
I enjoyed winning a couple or three days, and I have to move on.
The preparations for this wonderful season were very different from the usual one?
I can't say there was anything so special.
We started getting ready in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
Trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the gatherings, then at home again.
It's the usual.
But with the coach, they set the goal of trying to get to a new level that I haven't been to yet.
Almost all winter time was spent laying the groundwork.
We ran a bunch of sneaks, we did exercise on general physical training, which included both the thrust and the seat, and we pumped our back.
Then they started training, doing a lot of engineering.
Have you been watching the competition?
I always try to do that, and there's no problem with that in the Internet age.
I saw the Winter Championships of Europe, and the French took the whole pedestal in the barrier sprint!
I thought I'd do something. Diluting this company.
With every start this season, you added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've been working on a similar pattern for the last few seasons.
There's no way I'm running 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always turn my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All work focused on this outcome.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready to do something, and at competitions, you don't always get to show your willingness.
How was it, for example, at the London Olympics?
To be honest, I was trying to forget the semi-final race.
I was ready to be very good, I could really run out of 13 seconds.
Even if I had repeated my best performance at the time, I'd be the bronze medalist for the Games.
But bad luck.
Remember your first World Cup?
What about it?
It was in Daegu.
I really wanted to get into the finals at the time, and there was this maximum program.
And fell right off the morning, in the pre-runs.
That's when I realized breaking out and walking around means never running anywhere.
Two years later, at the Moscow World Cup, he was in the final with better time.
I remember how I felt before the race: I really wanted to win gold at the time!
How does it work if you're fast enough not to lose your head or pass out?
That's the hardest part.
You have to be very careful, focused on technology, so you don't push the barriers.
Noticed that it's easier when you focus on the process rather than the outcome.
And it's fun when you feel like you're running and it's like you're doing it all by yourself!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the interior, after their first major successes, are trying to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever thought of that before?
It's better at home anyway.
I don't know where I'm going without my coach, who needs me?
It might be nice to have better terms, but I'm trying to be happy with what I have.
How long have you two been together?
Since I was 12 years old, since I got into the track.
I mean, first I trained with his wife, who was working with the kids, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, and then I jumped long, triple.
The children's lot was when they throw the ball, jump from place to place...
At 14, I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
Since the first race, it has been possible to meet the standard of a second adult.
That's what I'm doing.
There's never been any fear of barriers?
I got a deal with them right away.
But there's always been a lot of work to do on technology.
There's been a lot of pain in one race!
But there's no way out of this routine.
The tech needs to get it fixed all the time - so I can wake up at night, I get up and run through the barriers.
Everyone who's seen your race in Beijing claims it was a very beautiful race.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually re-examine my races, and I couldn't help it.
But efficiency needs to be further worked out, there's no limit to perfection.
Aren't you afraid the victory of the year before the Olympic Games will be heavy on your shoulders?
As they say in such cases, I will try to live up to expectations.
If you've chosen this road, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, you don't have to feel any extra weight.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Otar Kushanahsvillei
Well, I'm not naive enough to be surprised by the response to an interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, not feed them bread - give them a ride to the enemy.
And even though I didn't wrap my flag, and that's exactly what I said a million times here, and I didn't call anyone a bastard, that's not what hit me.
All my pseudo-friends are in a flash, and they're gone.
The press I'm going through is so strong, even me, who's seen the sights of a boy, I think people are full of whites.
It's like walking, walking, and you got attacked by a mob and you've got to be tumbled.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a howitzer, I'm old, I'm scared.
The other thing is no support.
I had no illusions, and now...
I've always had the best self-sufficiency, so eat it.
Only assholes can give passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson.
I'd rather be a better journalist than a shameless job.
A week ago, in Kiev, Otar Kushanahshvili described the Crimean events in sharp terms:
What happened to the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I believe the reference to how Khrushchev's drunk tried to sign something doesn't in any way fit into the general picture of a human dorm.
It's like coming to a neighbor's house and taking his apartment...
The Kremlin war has gone, and it will only end there.
I'm pretty sure, like in the summer of 2008, it started with a call from some bastard from the Kremlin.
I have an idea who it might have been...
Cobzon doesn't have much to live for.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, they took down his monument.
Of course, people remembered him as an insult to their small homeland.
Reconciliation now depends on Vladimir Vladimirovich alone.
Sunrise 7 is in the top ranking despite Ninth's attempts to highlight the leaders' loss at Today Show.
Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson's raid on Canberra to highlight the consequences of the Liberal Party's announcement to free the leader's seat failed to raise the Today rating significantly.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull's defeat of Tony Abbott.
The competition, Sunrise, with leading David Koch and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long international broadcast, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
This distance torture did not seem to have much significance for Australian viewers, although Sunrise had 397,000 viewers in five of the largest cities, compared with Today's 339,000.
Today gained a little more than it did on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but the figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000, compared with 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers in September, compared to 314,000 in Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!
Published by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015.
The most important news for Seventh was the amazing 800 Words debut with Eric Thomson, the former star of Packed to the Rafters.
A new drama about a newly widowed father who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with her two children has gathered an impressive audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thomson could handle a popular show alone without Rebecca Gibney's Rafters star.
Last night's result is a loud answer "yes."
The X Factor Seventh remained in strong positions with an audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily bypassing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the seventh, luck and failure on the second night of Chase Australia mixed.
The first half hour (from 5 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.) of Andrew O'Keefe's new television show gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 5.30 p.m. to 6 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuyra (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 viewers, and the second half hour was overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The fall in Chase Australia ratings for the second night will make Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for the Million Dollar Minute, which failed to replay the McGuyre show.

The three finalists agree that the Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Is the secret solved?
Lana Jevon-Fallows, Sarah McKay, and Snowy Marcosky may have accidentally made it clear which one of them would win the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually remain in The Bachelor is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who got to the finale, of course, remain silent about which one of them got his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snowy Marcoski, and Lana Jevons-Fallows on the eve of the day when there would be two girls left, they might have accidentally given us a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood remains silent until Thursday's finale.
All three women come into the lyrical mood, telling us why Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, his purpose, his family values, his vitality as the reason each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But with their answers to the question, "If not you, who should have the last Wood rose?" they could have been reluctant to tell which one actually won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jevons-Fallows and Marcosky were sure to call MacKay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have had a good relationship since day one.
"From the moment I joined the contestants, I felt the energy (Saras) and the energy of Sam, and realized that they were very appropriate to each other, and I had no doubt about it throughout the show," said Jevons-Fallows.
"Sarah is a very open man, she's easy and fun," Marcoski added.
I saw them together, and there's really a pull between them.
They feel fine and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great couple.
MacKay herself said that, thanks to her home dates last week, she realized that Wood might be "that man."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized that it was definitely not just a game -- I believed him with all my heart," she said.
Asked who Voodoo should choose if it wasn't her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same, and Snow and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor shows on Wednesdays at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarrid Hayne had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle have been very interested in him since he moved to the U.S., and so have a lot of other clubs that sent out requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hane chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsoul, and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for losing the ball that a former Australian rugby league player allowed on the first return pant in a win-win game with Minnesota 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another opportunity to return the pant, and he also used it in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself on the bright side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of throwing the newcomers in front of the team, he cheered them up.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
The 49ers Special Reporter Cam Inman reported that Hane also received support from Thomas McGoy's Special Team Coordinator, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hain lost the ball at the panta return by the Minnesota Wakings team during the first quarter.
This was clearly not the beginning of NHL's debut with Hein and his numerous Australian fans.
It was seen that Hain was fighting when he left the field after losing the ball, and later he told the host of the show "Hamish and Andy" on Australian Radio 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a better start for a career in the NFL.
"It happens, you're just thinking about the next game, that's all," Hayne said.
Hein compared his failure to his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when a ball throw in his credit zone was attempted by Queensland.
In the end, this experience proved very useful to a 27-year-old player.
He photographed the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted it to Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under gun threat at Siberian airport.
Openly defying President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was condemned, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were thwarted.
There had been clashes between migrants and the police at the Hungarian border.
The refugees protested at the border of Serbia near the Hungarian town of Reské, which developed into clashes with law enforcement officials.
As a result, Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, transferring Reuters.
Migrants stone the police and try to tear down the border fence.
Support has been sent to the scene of the clashes, and the police have responded to the aggression of migrants and their attempts to cross the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants fled into Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border by bus towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports BBC.
The authorities had allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and transport them from there to the country in question.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament tightened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the involvement of the army in the protection of State borders, the prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, and the accelerated procedure for the processing of asylum requests.
The Hungarian court had already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, and he would therefore be deported and would not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
It is also the intention of the Hungarian Parliament to consider in the near future the transfer of responsibility for border protection to the Hungarian Armed Forces to the Hungarian Parliament.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175 km barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian confessed to the largest cyber attack in US history.
The accused of the largest cyber attack in US history, Russian Vladimir Drinkman, confessed to stealing over 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During his trial at the New Jersey Federal Court, Drinkman confessed to conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and commit fraud.
During the session, a Russian spoke of a conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen accused of cyberattacks against 15 companies.
The total damage caused by the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
“Such defendants as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy and national security,” U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said.
Drinkman is facing 30 years of imprisonment, as well as a $1 million fine.
In sentencing, the court will take account of the Russian confession and may shorten the sentence.
Drinkman's sentence will be announced on January 15th.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smylanets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt in the crimes charged against him.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk, with Russia's support for the Bashar Al-Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, United States Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia’s support for President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,” says a report published on the US State Department website.
Kerry confirmed the US commitment to fight the Islamic State (which is banned by the Supreme Court in Russia) as part of a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad "can never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of its support for the Assad regime.
The night before, the White House press secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation unless it stopped supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join the international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media have frequently reported the presence of Russian soldiers on Syrian territory.
To which the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and were helping Syrians to learn the technology to use it against Islamists.
Four died when police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets into a crowd protesting the proposed new constitution of the country, as stated by the spokesman on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital.
Bishno Prasad Dakal, chief of district police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered at a police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas, then shot in the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to be lethal, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last in weeks of violent protests in southern Nepal, the plains, where the Madesi people claim that the new provinces under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests have also taken place in western Nepal, among Taru citizens who wish to have their own staff.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10
On August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for several centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process following a devastating earthquake that claimed thousands of lives in April.
Legislators voted in favour of articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials announced that a new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create an enterprise of 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as a centre of the chemical industry and has a well-developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by the new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
He presented the results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects to the Regional Correspondent.
Oleg Valeryevich, where did you start as mayor?
First of all, I reviewed the results of the financial and business audits and initiated an independent audit of local budget expenditures.
An audit of municipal property was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the number of documents to five days.
In the past, the papers could have gone through the courts for months.
Activities have been developed to improve the revenue base and optimize costs.
Last November, a Government retreat was held in Sayansk to address the socio-economic development of the Territory.
The city did not have any design and estimation documents (PPDs) for any of the sites.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started by preparing POJA for roads, kindergarten, northern sewer and water.
Roadworks on two sections are under way.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
This positive demography has not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in kindergartens is one of the most pressing ones to date.
Since 1 September, the 320-seat day care centre No. 10 has been closed for major repairs.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million roubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, kindergarten No. 23 opened after renovation and now has 200 children.
The repairs were made on the basis of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, at a cost of over 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds were secured for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the People's Initiatives programme also helped.
There are plans to start building a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the number of children between the ages of one and a half and three.
There are no queues for children between the ages of three and seven.
Investors are interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city must be carried out primarily by the Saiyan enterprises, and it is they that must be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-family house for orphans in Leningrad neighbourhood is being put into operation.
With regard to construction, I would add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya, which has been included in the economy-class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 blocks will begin shortly.
In all, we have announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing for those wishing to participate in the programme.
One condition is that the dwelling should not be more than 30,000 roubles per square metre, which includes a turnkey finish.
If we can manage the assigned amounts, we will continue to participate in the programme.
As far as investors are concerned, we have other interesting projects.
The area of the district was , and the area of the district was .
We're working with the D.A.'s office to rebut this deal.
Especially since the land under the facility is federally owned.
Work is under way with Moscow and 88 hectares are being transferred to regional ownership, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor willing to invest 1.5 billion roubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
We'll have 900 jobs as we launch the mumps, which will be a great help to the city.
Sayansk has a social partnership institute?
We have some 140 social and economic partnership agreements.
A large number of projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Businesses such as the East Centre, the Novo-Ziminsk TEM, the Saiyan Broiler and the IDF PC are providing tangible support, and the management of these enterprises responds to all requests.
Just prior to the Day of the City of Saiyan Broiler, the city was given a children's town by East Center to repair the horseyard, where specialists were working with children to treat them with more than 1 million rubles.
With sponsorship, it has been possible to improve the area of the city registry.
The sponsors helped to celebrate City Day in a colorful manner.
As in the good old days, there was a parade of urban groups and organizations.
A city record, a book of Saiyan poets, was published.
The pioneers and people who made a major contribution to Saiyansk’s development were given commemorative medals.
They also participate in the City Charitable Fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 roubles have been devoted to supporting talented young people, helping children in need of expensive treatment, and supporting children from low-income families.
How are human resources problems in the social sphere addressed in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and subject teachers in the city.
The provision of housing for professionals is crucial to addressing the human resources issue.
Over the past year, we have provided five apartments for doctors, and four teachers have been provided with office accommodation.
We have a housing programme that can be privatized in five years.
It's planned to remodel the building, where eight more apartments for teachers will be built.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the “Housing for the Russian Family” programme.
In the long run, construction of a house for budget workers.
Most importantly, there's a working team in town with which I can handle the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
Sayansk and our region have great potential.
A bill has been introduced in Duma to index social pensions in response to price increases.
A bill has been submitted to the State Duma providing for the indexation of social pensions every year since 1 February, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document, Alexander Lomakin-Romyants, a member of the “Just Russian Federation”, also proposes additional indexation of pensions on 1 April, if the rate of increase in the subsistence minimum is higher than the rate of increase in the prices of goods and services.
Social pensions are indexed according to the legislation in force every year from 1 April, taking into account the growth rate of the minimum subsistence level of a pensioner in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The bill introduced into the lower house provides for the introduction of an indexation of social pensions, taking into account the rate of increase in consumer prices.
The first indexation is postponed to 1 February and the second is on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA stated to Mogerini that it was unacceptable to impose sanctions on parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogerini, OSCE Speaker Ilkka Canerva stated that sanctions against legislators participating in assembly activities were not acceptable.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation to the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar, Nikolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, the signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Cyprus, Cyprus, Greece, Germany, France, Italy, have been collected in support of Canerva's position.
"There's already been enough support," Kovalev said.
He had previously stated that the head of the PA of OSCE had intended to collect signatures from deputies, who had indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians should not be imposed.
In particular, Kovalev noted that Canerva had promised to raise the problem to the level of the EU's leadership and to “send a petition”.
NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Cape is 60%.
A broad low-pressure front about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape is likely to turn 60 per cent into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, reporting on Tuesday by the National Hurricane Center of the United States.
Another well-defined area of low pressure around the middle between the Green Cape islands and the Small Antilles also has a 60 per cent probability of tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, reported by synoptics from Miami.
Google is launching a double-donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a double-donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations assisting European refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used an uncharacteristic personal approach, announcing a collection campaign on its blog.
Instead of making a statement, Google worker Rita Masood, who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We traveled on questionable trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, so many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
Donations will be made to four non-profit organizations involved in refugee and migrant assistance: Médecins sans frontières, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million in donations until the amount on the Google.com/refuguerelief page reached $11 million.
Europe is confronting the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, which was triggered by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Obesity surgery can help diabetics with slight obesity
The beneficial effect after surgery of obesity in type 2 small obesity can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetics with slight obesity live longer than those receiving non-surgical treatment after surgery.
"The mortality statistics aren't immediately visible," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the JAMA Survey column.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organizsists to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but the main studies have been conducted among people with morphide obesity with a body weight index (M.I.T.) of 35 or more.
The IMT, the weight measure relative to growth, is considered to be normal with a value of 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above shows that people with overweight, and people with IMTs above 30, are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital have used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and grate gastroectomy, with type 2 diabetes treatment in people with slight obesity.
The average IMT for those who were subjected to surgical interventions dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their research.
At the same time, IMTs for those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remain at around 29.
Of those who had undergone surgery, 36 per cent had fully cured diabetes and 28 per cent had partially cured diabetes.
In the group receiving medication, by comparison, only 1 per cent had total diabetes treatment, and only about 2 per cent had partial diabetes treatment.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LNP cholesterol were generally better in the surgical team”, the authors submit.
Researchers also monitored levels of A1s hemoglobin in the blood, which reflected levels of blood sugar in the dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, says researchers.
After surgery, average A1c haemoglobin decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But the best glychemic control indicators, reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Cheng Soo’s research manager and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the group that had had hastroectomies, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved a greater decline in IMT (7.4 per cent versus 5.1 per cent) and in hemoglobin A1c (3.1 per cent versus 2.1 per cent), and was closer to total remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent versus 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not show the advantages of the surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does increase life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the Phoenix College of Medicine, Arizona University.
According to a Swedish study, for people with obesity who chose bariatric intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was about 29 per cent lower than the group in which more traditional methods were used.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encouraged people with an IMT below 35 interested in such a procedure.
“The report is very important here because it states that such surgery is safe in a group with a low IMT, where there is no increased risk of death or renal disease”, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient's I.T.T. is in the range of 27 to 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they build up the genetic changes that cause obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it's very difficult to reverse it.
In Motivations, the robbers took out the fur coats and 9 million rubles.
In Motivations, robbers attacked residents of the Moscow house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's furs.
Interfax informs on this subject with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown persons entered the house on Gorkoi Street through an open front door, tied the 20-year-old son of the housewife and threatened both with a knife and stole 9 million rubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9 million,265,000 roubles, and criminal proceedings were initiated under the item “Scatter”.
European fans risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 peterburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to see the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to obtain permission.
In the opinion of the experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to the world championship, the authorities will have to come up with an urgent plan to resettle all the city’s guests.
Rosbalta's interviewees believe that the tournament will raise rental rents by 10 to 30 per cent, and will have to be overpaid after the championship.
The World Cup has brought the authorities' attention to the state of Russian hotels.
Under the law, written specifically for the first time, every hotel in Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that this will not be possible for all: hotels are so afraid of checks that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service in Petersburg.
According to the head of UFAS, Vadim Vladimirov, the agency has studied 138 hotels and is now planning to file 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to the anti-monopolists.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies cheated citizens by placing a number of stars in advertising, noting Vladimirov.
The problem is, right now, literally every number counts, no one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will take over all the peterburg hotels.
In the city now, tourists can count on 30,500 rooms.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two-star and three-star hotels, and 550 one-star hotels.
According to the First Deputy Tourism Development Committee, Nana Guvicia, only 23 hotels have so far been classified - so many checks have been carried out by accredited companies in Petersburg.
Whether a hotel ordered a similar procedure from a regional enterprise is not known for the surprising circumstances.
I mean, there may be more classified, but no one knows about it.
“The last six months of hotels have not been very eager to be classified”, acknowledged the director of the Northwest branch of the Russian Tourin Industry Union, Catherine Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season in which hotels earn the most and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets that did not include the cost of inspections, and the procedure may cost the hotel between 30,000 and 100,000 roubles or more.
However, in recent times hotel managers have stepped up and started applying for classification, assuring Shadskaya.
Hotels have to make it to July 1, 2016, or they will not only pay a fine, but they will not get the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on stellarity, a fixed hotel room fee will be developed for the duration of the tournament.
The formulas by which the value will be calculated will be released next year.
This is in order to avoid a 200-300 per cent price rise, as is the case during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience, and you don't have two or three promotions, but you have to give hotels a living.
"I think it's going to be 50%," explained the president of the Russian hotel association Gennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimirov, in turn, is not sure that price fixing is consistent with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much this fits into economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's better than unbridled pricing," he said.
It's not clear what's going to happen to the popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the State have introduced a bill to prohibit hostels in homes.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not apply to Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved," Nana Gwacia says.
However, she said that the owners of the mini hotels should in any case be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma did approve the bill, about 80 per cent of hostels would be closed in Petersburg, and to date there were 1,500 rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hotels of Northwest Leonid Garbar, there is a shortage of two- and three-star hotels in Petersburg, which are specifically sought by football fans, but there is a bias towards hotels with four and five stars.
This state of affairs is similar to the situation where “at the 80th thousandth stadium there are 75,000 vips”.
This can be fixed at the expense of mini hotels.
Their possible ban is considered by an expert to be "idiotic": "I find it strange that some people can live in apartments, but those who come here can't."
If the hostel is used as a hostel, I agree it's wrong.
But if it's like a short-term hotel, why not?
Mini-guests run the risk of missing the World Cup because of their slowness.
Hundreds of small hotels just won't be able to get classified, and the pit is digging itself.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be booked.
“There are not many companies that can perform this procedure, so they will give up less-paid orders from mini hotels, but will choose those that are more expensive,” said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the numbers of checks that have been made are now much higher than in Petersburg.
The reason for the peterburg delay included the constant relocation of the Government ' s tourist unit, which was not conducive to smooth operation.
According to experts, if the peterburg hotels are not enough for everyone, it is likely that attention will have to be paid to regional hotels and vacation homes.
Following the 300th anniversary of Petersburg, the river fleet can be mobilized into the city, so guests can live in cabins.
In addition, many fans are prepared to come in vans to sleep in.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that they're empty," I'm sure Gennady Lamshin.
A rental home will also be a major feature of the football competition.
It is likely that there will be a reserve of rental apartments in the city.
The rent rate will increase by 10 to 30 per cent.
"From the obvious, the first place to go is near the stadium," noted Larissa Bragin, a tenant from the Development and Research Agency.
The rental price may not return to the same level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will also be facilitated by the construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
We should not forget the human qualities of our citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city where people not only point the way, but can also take a mini tour.
There are complications.
In 1970, my father met a family from Murmansk, a father, a mother and two children.
They didn't have a place to sleep. Hotels were hard to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," the interviewer remembered.
True, he added that there was no such feature in the city at the moment: calling on people to their homes could have consequences and be scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the bad decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hotels and governments will have to be remembered.
Zhirinovsky "sill" in the Amur region.
I admired Zhirinovsky's clown in the State Duma today.
He did things like that when our generation was just learning how to sell newspapers, and he's still in perfect shape.
The theme of the speech, I think, is "the LDDP protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region."
The protocols are not shaking - there is nothing; the LDPR does not seem to have any protocols other than those signed by the buffalo.
He picks up the second-placed Ivan Abramov and screams like, "Here's the winner of the election!"
And then, after a fight with the presiding officer, he takes the faction out of the conference room screaming literally, "You're all with your cons and thieves on the fronts."
The press naturally focuses not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
In reality, Wolfovich has embellished the Amur region with Abramov in a beautiful and elegant way.
For the whole country, this is another Girinovsky act in the "Standard" style, not a political party protest against the results of a particular election.
And the faction has formally denounced, and the election, according to the party website and Facebook, Ivan Abramov, is not recognized, but the leader is clearly off the table.
Leaves the dead in Amura to bury their own dead, and he gives the good news against the "One Russia" in general and innocent homeland.
It's a fine decision, so you don't lose your face, and you don't go into a real scandal, not a show scandal.
Another thing is that now Abramov himself is in a strange position.
He couldn't wait to hear anything but screams from his superiors, and there are no alternative protocols.
He's not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but, on the other hand, for the narrow circle, he's the formal reason for both insulting the respectable champion and, even more so, the hamous attacks on EP and ONF.
And then, of course, he has to really think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, politics number two of the region and candidate number one of the only regional single-mandate district, it can turn into a pariah that has been successfully used by its own party leadership and super irritant for that SWF and the party leadership of a stranger.
I'm sure it wouldn't have been Zhirinovsky, but he should have been invented and observed with respect.
The trump is still growing and growing.
News has come that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next prisoner.
I mean, the bath fell out of nowhere.
The only thing that kept Abramova's theme under control.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in the countries of origin of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the continuing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre in Oxford, dedicated to ethical research, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He stated that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be higher than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was inadequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“The care of thousands of refugees is excellent, but at the same time you must also think about lasting solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries”, he stressed.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush’s actions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US’s violent reaction triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that it was possible to solve the problem through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed hand disinfectants over the past four years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported an almost 400 per cent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who had swallowed a high alcohol-contaminated hand disinfectant since 2010, as reported by the Georgia State Toxicology Centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia's Toxicology Center, cases of ingestion of hand disinfectants by children under the age of 12 reported to toxicological centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 1,6117 in 2014.
“Children have more contact with these substances, and unfortunately, some percent of them go to the E.R.,” said López CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, and some do so to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
The YouTube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant fluid as a cheap drink.
Teenagers reportedly mixed disinfectant liquid with alcohol-containing mouthwashing fluid to obtain a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the pleasant smell of disinfectant fluid.
"The child doesn't think it could hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (disinfecting fluids for the hands) are fragrances.
There are disinfectant fluids for hands that smell strawberries, grapes, oranges that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfection fluid contains about 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
Small children, in particular, have only a few sprays that can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's high-concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician at the Tox Centre at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave a glass of whiskey, but people keep these hand disinfectants in plain sight, and if kids get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a strawberry-flavored hand disinfectant at school in about four sprays, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who was legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija confused the words and couldn't walk when she was taken to the E.R.
The doctors watched her all night at a separate children's clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain trauma, as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," said CNN, orthoria Scott, Naiji's mother.
It might well have been fatal for my baby.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-spirited substances or disinfectant napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant fluids from the hands of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, not ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-graders in northern New York conspired to poison their “opposite” teacher by “dissemination of antibacterial substances in the classroom”, according to a police report.
The teacher has a severe allergy to hand disinfectors, and she banned them from her class.
The police believe that the failed plan was "empty talk" and addresses discipline issues to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the N.K. Kruska children's library, the iron owl is saddened.
The kids who come for the books are trying to feed her candy.
For several generations, he has been going to this library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the 20th century made loud readings here, performed plays on Mayakovsky poems, carried out literary quizzes, and corresponded with Lenin’s wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper Young Stalinist wrote in 1939, “the friendship between Hope of Constantine Kraup and friends of Barnaul City's children's library” grew stronger every day.
Konstantinovna’s hope even sent a picture of her child once to distant Barnaul friends.
And when the Barnacles asked if Hope Constantine objected to having her name assigned to the library, she wrote that she didn't, she didn't.
Letters have been burning in the museum for a long time, and the grandchildren and grandchildren of the first readers have to explain to whom this harsh profile decorates the bareleph on the library building.
During the years of restructuring, many people called and resented: Why is the children’s library not renamed?
Let's have a library of some good children's writer without political colour!
The library staff sat down, thought about it, and decided to leave it at that.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul as "Linka" in Moscow.
There's a yellow brick track on the floor of the library lobby.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is Olly Moscow's favorite theme.
Olja used to be a law manager, came to work at eight, left at five, and all the other managers were different from the only people who had a love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet saying, "I need an illustrator for the book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mom has cancer."
Olya made illustrations, and she thought that life could end at any moment, and there would be no miracles in it unless you created them yourself.
She now works in a library, illustrates the children's books of writers all over the world, and writes fairy tales.
Traditionally, children are considered to be losing interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But there are children who are reading, and their parents understand the meaning of reading, says the Russian Planet, the director of Tatiana Kushweed's library.
In recent years, we've even had such a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and it's going to live - the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
There's a big exhibition window in the library lobby with an updated photo exposition.
Every quarter, new photographs of readers who go to the library by their entire family — their mother, father, and children — are posted.
The library is glad that more and more popes are coming with the children.
If at two years of age a child has been read all of Chukovsky, at an older age he needs books that are more complicated.
But there is now a law that prohibits an eight-year-old prodigy from issuing 12+ books.
To get a book like this, a kid has to bring his parents with him - they come back, then they come back again, and then "Krupskaya" becomes a sort of family club for them.
There's a treasure in the library-- a pre-revolutionary collection of yarns and eres, leading Corolenko to the Niva magazine app, the Murzilki embroidery of 1936.
Because we're not just the conceptual space of the book, we're open to movement, we're trying to be a special place -- not home, not work, not school -- explains Tatiana Kushweed.
You can come to us to read, play, draw together.
We've made a play zone for the little ones - the baby just comes to play, and the hand is still reaching for the book!
Some of our readers are being taken away by their parents, and they stand up to their feet, and they don't want to leave.
Mothers often come with wheelchairs, and we are pleased that they put the library first among all the other places to go with the babies.
Tatiana Kushweed says that today's children, as we once did, love classical children's literature:
“The publishing business is now evolving, and much attention is being paid to the authors, who are the link between generations.”
And when it comes to little babies, it's important that there be some hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes booklets for parents, which show what is happening in modern child literature, what books should be looked at, and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden for adults to carry books outside the reading room.
Only children have this magical privilege.
...There's a square hatch in the outermost room of the library with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in the bookstore.
The steps will be squeaking under your steps -- it's a very old time machine.
You're dating your childhood book like an old friend. Hi, it's a good thing you and I haven't changed.
Ally's still walking along a road paved with yellow bricks, lazy Tol Reds stealing magic matches, and yet he never told the goddamn Bourgeois of the War Secret - that's a strong word.
Books like passwords, you can recognize your own anywhere.
There's also real book rarity in the vault, like a pre-revolutionary collection of yarns and eres.
Or take Corolenko to the famous Niva magazine app.
Or a 1936 Murzilka.
Time has aged the pages, painted them in tea color.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are the pieces of our future collection, and I dream of retiring and doing rare children's books.
But the kids aren't gonna fall for it, so to speak, and the paints in the old books aren't very bright, and the topics... you open the front page, and there's Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now it's like, why were we all writing this "Pioner Truth"?
But it was still interesting,' tells Galina Ilyasov, the head of the bookstore, "The Russian Planet".
The Murzilka pages are darker from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna has been running the bookstore for the rest of her life.
She knows the color of Buratino's cap, what school year Harry Potter became the captain of Gryffindor's Quidditch team, what situations Carlson uses a motor silencer in, and who Alice Selezzeva's father works for.
The librarian’s work is not paid enough, and anyone who can live without these books is very quick to find a different profession.
Only the most convinced ones remain: educators, teachers, ministers of the religion of the book.
You can also get to know them from a smile - it's considered to be a professional trait of a child librarian.
If he smiled at you at the first minute of the conversation, it was a professional.
I love children’s books. As a librarian, I like them to be on the shelves, and I love to read them, ” says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.
Reading modern Russian writers, fresh translations...
Of course, I think things were different when I was a kid.
The books were the most interesting and exciting thing that ever happened to me.
And since I loved them madly, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be in spite of the reeds.
And I rejoice when our former readers bring children, or even grandchildren...
There's no disagreement at Celtic.
Griffiths denied the conversation about the Celtic disagreements after he admitted to Dale that Hoops was in a bad position, but he's gonna fix it.
Hart's gonna protest the Scottish Football Association's claim to Neilson, and Warburton fears signing contracts in January that could undermine team unity.
The Dons has increased the advantage over the Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first-time sentence gave Aberdeen a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodri, which allowed the Dons to lose five points from Celtic.
Griffiths denied the argument.
This led to rumours of disagreements in Celtic, which were thwarted by Griffiths, who said that he and his teammates did not suffer from any heightened criticism in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling the tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots aren't in the race for the title, de Boer.
Former Rangers quarterback and former Dutch team member Ronald de Boer claimed that Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celtic because he was not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently a representative of Ajax, said, "In Holland, the most attractive moments of Celtic games are no longer shown, why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in Old Firm games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
The defeat of Malmö and, as a result, the withdrawal from the League of Champions was soon followed by the loss of 10 Aberdeen football players, who now, by five points, is at the top of the table.
However, Dale said, "Silica has had bad periods before, and we'll go out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's a shame, and a lot of people are really, really angry or upset about what's going on.
So do we, but we need to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic's support, because that makes the players much better.
Staying together is so important right now.
Warburton is looking forward to January's transfers.
Despite opinions just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he identified some of the objectives of January's transfers, Mark Warburton's Ranger boss is distrustful of the January campaign, claiming that he does not want to undermine the team's unity.
Brentford's former attacker said, "The January Transfer Window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players that come in the summer, you have the period before the season to adapt them, which you saw in our own group in this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Michou, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at the end of his career.
Suoncy Michou's attacker, connected to Celtic during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with the Swans had ended.
A 29-year-old player suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Hartes are going to confront the SFA about Neilson's statements.
"Harts" was run with a score of 2:1, when Paterson was removed, and they started losing 3:2, but the red card was later cancelled; this is the third red Collum card, cancelled in eight months.
Neilson doesn't retract his words, saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tynkasle.
Heiburnian's hard-core player was reprimanded after admitting that he was singing a song with offensive words about ex-Harts player Rudy Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the beginning of the Edinburgh Derby in Tainkasle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was hot," said the attacker, adding, "I can safely say I wasn't going back to Tynkasle if he wasn't playing for Celtic.
Donnelly: The Tannadis council is confident in the management of the Dundee United.
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundee United's board of directors remains confident that the management team will make a difference, but agrees that the deterioration in the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys ready to come out again," said Donnelly.
Mclnnes is glad he won "no good" from Hamilton.
Derek McInness admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assasses to win the seventh straight victory in the league, which put them five points above Celtic, top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Rooney's first-time sentence.
McInness said, "There's no team here that's gonna win anything-- a cup, or a league championship that hasn't won a meeting like this."
The unemployment rate among Scottishs remains unchanged, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is rising
The number of unemployed in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher than in the United Kingdom by 5.5 per cent, as shown by figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with 2,612,000 currently employed.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent in a quarter, above the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Minister, David Mandela, commented on the most recent figures: “The Government's long-term plan laid the foundations for strengthening the economy.”
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made its historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the Scottish labour market, with increased employment and reduced unemployment.
Why am I witness to an execution in Oklahoma?
Today, by avoiding legal interference at a late stage, I will watch a man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting on the death row galleries in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is executed with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
This request was first made in January, through a close friend of his, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day approached, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more people than seats, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will see it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'll be sitting with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we have our own relationship after a few months of phone calls and one visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk to him.
Prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'm gonna have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of Twittering for acting in an impartial manner.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admits that she could have made a better statement herself, but still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, the reporter from Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I'm not going to go into detail here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry van Treese's murder make him guilty of aiding and abetting a crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I'm pretty sure there wasn't enough evidence for a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this angle, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't say I'll be completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be contacted.
You'll learn from me what it's like to watch a man I like die without having to.
The man being chased by the police was persuaded to get out of the Canning River.
A constable from Canning-Vail managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River and stay dry himself.
Perth's resident intended to leave the police, but failed to get stuck in dirty water in shallow waters a few metres away from a police officer trying to "softly persuade him to get off the shore."
Canning-Vail police were called on Tuesday for illegal entry into territory in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them by throwing himself at Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I won't go out, come on, grab me," said Sgt. Chandell Castledyne.
Constable Lachlan Perchavetz didn't really want to wet his uniform, so he used a safer reception-- "negotiation with a good cop."
"Sometimes, people do strange things to try to escape," says Sgt. Castledyne.
That's exactly what Ben Kazins' champion footballer remembers.
In 2006, Cazines moved into a ditch to avoid a meeting with a police patrol to check for alcohol, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts proved to be in vain, but encouraged the locals to invent a joke "Ben Cazins Beatlon."
Peter Moody accuses stewards of trying to spy and threatens to quit horse racing.
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria of trying to introduce a spy into his stable last year and threatened to abandon horse sports immediately.
He was targeted by the stewards and ethics officers of Racing Victoria, who he accused of having campaigned personally against him, and the withdrawal of Lady Tatai from the launch due to the violation of the rules for the use of drugs on the day of launch, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always doing his best to participate in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of Lidari's choice for a cobalt, which he could not explain.
He held his tongue about suspicion of espionage for a year and a half and didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've endured it for a long time, but sometimes it makes you so out of control, you can't hold back," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to deal with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep tight.
I want to walk high and I want my owners to know I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start thinking it's not, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Previously, Moody reported sensationally during an interview at Racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy in his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I'd call myself if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to share information about what I'm doing in my stable," Moody said at Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If so, they should certainly all apply, since they failed to catch me.
Robert RVL, former RVL Chairman, David Moody, current RVL Chairman, and Bernard Sondry, the incumbent RVL CEO, knew about it all the time and now know it.
Shouldn't it make me think it's becoming personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to hold accountable for what's going on in this business, people other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I that bad for this profession?
Maybe people out there think that's what it is.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I'm sure what I'm saying can get them to think about it.
But I've come to a point where I don't care, and it makes me sad.
It makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and hold them responsible for their decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
Coach's frustration only grew during a long investigation into the cobalt and Lidari incident, and the last take-off of the horse led him to state that he could throw his license on the table.
Moody, best known for preparing the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of medication on the day of the competition "a ridiculous thing" after a horse had been compressed with clay on its feet, which was a violation of the rules.
It's a race violation.
“I must be held fully responsible for this,” he said.
One of my employees accidentally made a compress on her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have got it yesterday, just like she did.
She was with him the day of the race.
Moody can be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medication on the day of the compress competition, on which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far," Moody said.
Driver who hit and fled the Cobram incident was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobram the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the morning of Saturday by Murray Valley Highway.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old in the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with abandoning the scene of the incident, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic regulations.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old Cobram resident, remains stable in the hospital.
Craig Bellamy, a Melbourne Storm coach, is arguing against his rivals for the use of hard-core force.
Coach "Melburn Storm" Craig Bellamy called his team's criticism of intercepting the ball as "the imposition of the agenda" by two NRL champions.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, stated that the judges allowed Storm to "fight" his team during Storm's sudden victory in the Sydney qualification final on Friday night.
Coach "Brisbane Broncos" Wayne Bennett made a clear hint at "Storm" after his team won the final of the Northern Queensland Cowboys qualification tournament on Saturday night, when he called this game "typical" for the rugby league and claimed that two of Queensland's teams were not "too successful" in hand-to-hand combat.
Bellamy defended his team intercepting the ball and said that they were just focused on "contact," intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was reassured by the two leading coaches' criticism of his team, which meant that they were concerned about the possible defeat from Storm.
"It keeps coming up -- I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about the tough moves when they beat us at 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything for a year in our defense systems or techniques, just in the last six weeks, we've been paying particular attention to the contact in the catch, and that was a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he's obviously been training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always manifests at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football," reminding his teacher that "St. George-Illavarre Dragons" Bennett won in the 2010 championship, showing boring football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was," Bellamy observed.
I remember that in 2010, St. George was criticized for calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young midfielders at their speed.
It's a football you'd like to play when you've got players like that.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two mid-fielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play it like this.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that Storm and Rusters were a match with more points than Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score?
In our game, he was 20:18, and there were two more attempts, and what, this is an impressive football?
Or do you think it's impressive to take breaks and failed attempts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means at some point we can meet them there.
Storm has a weekend off at the end of this week, as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Co. or Cronolla Sharks next Saturday night at the AMI Park finals, tickets will be available for sale next Tuesday morning.
A drug-stored Serb released on a $200,000 bail.
A man facing life imprisonment for attempting to steal 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released on $200,000 bail.
Marco Maksimovich, 29, was one of the five people arrested last month after the federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht, which came from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomer in August.
Throughout the morning, Maksimović and his associates were seen at the dock, and later he met them at the Comomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in Toyota Echo's car.
Despite the fact that Maksimović faces a life sentence for attempting to procure sufficient quantities of drugs for sale, Maksimović's lawyer claims that there is no evidence that the latter was trying to obtain the entire shipment and that the man could have been in the cafe without intent.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimović's mother and stepfather were offered a joint bond of $200,000 for his release.
“From the testimony of both of them, it is clear that the sum of $200,000 bail is too much of a financial burden for them,” Judge Flanagan observed.
But this measure alone is not enough to guarantee that he will not disappear, added the judge.
Maksimović was allowed to be released on bail on condition that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, reports daily to the police and observe a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katzikaris: "I'm very proud of Greece, which fought until the last few seconds."
Greece's chief coach, Fotis Katzikaris, paid tribute to his team after the Eurobasket 2015 Finals match 1/4 with Spain (71:73).
He said that the fate of the game had been resolved by some mistakes.
It was a big game, quotes AFP Katzicaris.
We were preparing for a great Spanish game.
Tried to work for the defense, but the mistakes in the defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "In CSAC, I will be assigned the functions of Kauna."
Joel Freeland, a newcomer of the CSAC, said he doesn't believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, quotes Freeland's R Sport.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to rebuild the center position, but I was more of a forward at the NBA.
Now, we're gonna have to confront a big center rival more than that, but I've done it before, so I think I can do it now.
The army won the Euroleague for the last time in 2008.
Since then, they've reached Final Four six times, but every time they couldn't show their best basketball.
There's a feeling the team's been jinxed.
That's the game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's complicated, I understand all the frustrations of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can do, we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague, I really think so.
I've always wanted to win this title, the Moscows have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSKA.
As for the jinx, I'm not a superstitious man and I don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you put these two things together, everything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as I can.
Luis Enrique: "For me, the match with Roma will be special."
The head coach of the Barcelonas, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the first round of the League of Champions tournament with "Roma" with special feelings.
According to the mentor, his current and former team's fight will be far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique trained "wolfs" in the 2011/12 season, but failed to demonstrate himself in the best way in Italy's capital.
I returned to Rome after a few years of experience.
I have extremely warm memories of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
It's all about starting the League of Champions with a win.
The August meeting at the João Gamper Cup won't affect team action in the next match.
I'm expecting from Roma a game she's shown in series A against Juventus.
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skryptchenko: Krasnodar has various options for attacking."
Acting head coach of Ural Vadim Skryptchenko, in the run-up to the 9th season of the Premier League with Krasnodar, noted the diversity of the attacking schemes of the rival team.
According to the mentor, the bulls have several models of assault in their arsenal.
The match will take place on 21 September and begin at 16.30 Moscow time.
How do we play with Reddar, let's see, the official Urala website quotes Scriptchenko's words.
We've got a whole week ahead of us.
This team has different options for attacking, it's conducting its attacks in a variety of ways, and we're a team that's not slow, so I think it's going to be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that Krasnodar is holding a League of Europe match against the Borussia of Dortmund, we will try to prepare ourselves very well to win.
Roher Kanyas: "Astana House can take glasses from anyone."
"Astana's quarterback, Roher Kanyas, expressed confidence in the future quality of his team's game after the first round of the league's championship tournament with Benfika (0:2).
According to Habbeke, in their field, the Astanans are able to take points from any rival.
Despite the fact that the match was hard for us, I can say that we played well, quotes the official UEFA website Kañas' words.
"Benfika" is higher, but in the home game, I think we can count on taking their glasses away.
It's quite real.
But first we have to think about Galatasarai and then Atletiko.
At home games, we can take points from anyone.
Rafael Benítez: "I repeat as many times as I can: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Raphael Benitez, head coach of the Reala, expressed satisfaction with the major victory in the first round of the League of Champions' Championships tournament with the "Shachter" (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to foreward Cristian Ronald, who had become the author of three heads.
The match was not easy because Schachter can own the ball, which is the official website of UEFA for Benítez's words.
The opponent didn't have many moments, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I can't say Real was perfect, but we had plenty of naked opportunities.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll do it all the time.
Jordy Alba: "Christian Ronaldo can't compare to Messi."
The protector of the Barcelonas, Jordy Alba, believes that no one can match his one-club Lionel Messi.
According to a Spaniard, foreward "Reala" Cristiano Ronaldo can't do that either.
The Messi is five heads above the others, quotes Le Figaro Alba.
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
Things change with Leo on the field, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: "Barcelona" has not only unique style, but also distinctive identities.
"Roma" quarterback Daniele De Rossi, on the eve of the league of champions' tournament with Barcelona, noted the importance of compactness and insurance in playing with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21:45 Moscow time.
Let's remind you that the S.E. will broadcast it.
"Barcelona" is a special rival, a good team with great players, quotes the official Web site of UEFA De Rossi.
It's hard to play with blue granite because they have not only unique styles, but also vivid identities.
To keep them, we'll have to work all the way through the match and back up each other.
The Messi is almost always successful when she goes round, so we need to stay compact and organized.
Jezov is hoping to go on the start of the SKA in a match with the Slovan.
Golkiper SKA Ilya Jezhov stressed that he hoped to join the army in the next KHL match.
Jezhev went out to the ice instead of Mikko Koskinen for the 23rd minute at the score of 0-3 and reflected all the throws at his gate, the fourth goal of the SKA missed after replacing the goalkeeper with the sixth field player.
The next match the team will be on their way against the Slovan.
I hope I get out in the next start-up match, quotes "R-Sport" Yezov's words.
I'm not a goalie expert, I'm a goalie, we don't have repeats of missed heads, so it's hard to trace.
"Dinamo" was good, everybody has bad matches.
The team still lost.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.
Shafarzhova went to the hospital with a viral infection.
Lucy Shafarzhova has been hospitalized with a bacterial infection, reports AFP.
At the moment, the Czech tennis player is in a clinic in Brno.
The time frame for the restoration of the finalist Roland Garros 2015 is not yet known.
Let us also recall that on Monday, Shafarzhova rose to one in the WTA ranking and is now the world's fifth racket.
Stevean Hogg used the girl's phone to get pedophiles to send photos.
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to solicit images of child abuse.
Stevean Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered with the Internet messaging service, where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found her phone missing and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked him out and found shocking photographs, and immediately noticed it to her mother.
The police arrived and saw five images, after which they examined the computers found at this address and found “relevant” queries in the search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done it because it might have been "involved with pedophiles," and then he would have "supposed that he was a cop to scare them."
Commissioner Eilid Robertson told the sheriff's court in Dundee: "He said it was addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted to making requests on the computer, but stated that it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was questioned about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him images and about asking him to send more photos.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl discovered the pictures on her phone, she called her mother, shivered and cried.
She saw obscene images on her phone, and then a face-to-face bet was held with the defendant.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the defendant had used a computer and the Plaistation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of making indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating bail on 25 January this year and not appearing in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, requested that Hogg not be listed as a sex offender, as it could be shown that there was no “significant sexual element” in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October, pending the receipt of reports from the social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but was taken into custody prior to the hearing of the other remaining cases.
He was added to the list of perpetrators of sexual offences even before the date of sentencing.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, is reading the wrong speech in Parliament.
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest statesman, fell down the runway earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video with the fall scene immediately spread through social media.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by statements by parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats to warn them against whistling Mugabe during the speech.
A month ago, they whistled at the President during his address to the nation in Parliament; that was what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a Member of Parliament of the Movement for Democratic Change, stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
“The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is called Death,” he told journalists at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned the noted members of Parliament that immunity ended in the Parliament building and that parliamentary immunity did not work as soon as they left.
A Member of Parliament stated that the party led by Morgan Tswangirai was “disturbed” by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its programme of restructuring and reducing service costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly growing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated job losses would amount to approximately $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, as stated in Hewlett-Packard’s statement.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” says Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard today, and the portfolio of business streams will be wider and deeper to help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and “will focus on providing previously unattainable complex technological solutions” to companies, as reported in the company's statement.
This divides the company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard for the production of electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in the process of undergoing a major reorganization from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world’s second-largest personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in the United States, is the latest development in this sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies are doing better.
Captain "Arsenala" Michel Arteta says that his fellow strawberries should support injured Jack Wilshire before playing with "Dinamo Zagreb."
In a conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that it was not until September, and that if Wilshire's recovery were to proceed as planned, there would be nothing to prevent him from returning to the game by Christmas.
With the most favourable developments, Wilshire will definitely miss at least four more games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The most unfortunate thing about this recent problem is that Wilshire was confidently finishing the previous season with the only ankle injury and was about to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not a fully healed bone.
Nothing serious.
It was just an accident.
It's not about the ankles or the injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related, but, as Hungarians also admitted, there is a risk of further injury to any player returning to the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavourable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire suffered 23 different injuries in the six years since his debut.
He also played in 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal's plan more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting in 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs that had the most missed days due to injuries.
Hungarian recognizes the possibility of being stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you're back in service after an injury, you've been vulnerable for a while -- in that time, you need to regain your strength and gain a competitive advantage," Hungarian said.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he recovers physically, I'm sure, as well as his career will be what he deserves.
The Arsenal starts a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday in a match with Dinamo-Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the team.
Héctor Belierin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Mathieu Debushi and Arteta will play in the start-up team.
Perhaps Wenger will also join Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroux in place of Nacho Moreal and Theo Wolcott.
"I'm trying to keep balance and give a little rest to those players who need it," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favorite in band F, Maximere Stadium in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo hasn't lost a single of 41 games since they managed to spend the last season as Invincible.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was exposed to an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal learned the lesson of the last season when the team was defeated in the Monaco League of Champions game, and remains with a weak hope of bringing the club to the final victory of the Cup of Champions.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger remarked.
Arsenal's never done it before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm a long-time realist.
We have ambition, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons in male friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially given how desperate men's need for frankness has become now more than ever, with young men's suicide rate at its highest level in 15 years.
In 2013, this was the single largest cause of death among men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely to die than women.
In an effort to understand the issue of the Campaign against Unhappiness, the year 2015 was declared the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to face this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a sufficient number of friends “in a normal mood”, the chances of recovery are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends halves the likelihood of mental disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first and foremost, it needs to be.
In an era when communications are managed by social networks, where style prefers content, the speed of response is often more appreciated than meaningful communication.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, to love fun and to be successful, even if there is real loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which have a greater impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire, the video game maker, recently observed, you can't actually buy more happiness for money.
The merit of Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each of the characters was identified not through his work, but rather through a personality that manifested itself in communicating with friends.
Joey's humor and Chandler's constant hugs, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' snorting on Rachel -- everything comes from understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As Samaritens told me, "...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal stresses how even the smallest communication of friends can be beneficial."
Often, men who come to us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old teaching of "live with it" is strong, just like the feeling that a frank conversation about problems can be perceived as a weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-lasting coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the subtle aspects of male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the status of an outsider, who talks over the phone, helps people in moments of despair, and long-term support comes from close family and friends.
So, if you're going to FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where you've got the whole set up for the holiday, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a drink.
Or, even better yet, if you see a lonely man at Starbucks, smile and say, "Hi."
I can't guess in advance what good friendship can do.
The Friends show "Comedy Central" from beginning to end, all 236 episodes, under the #FriendsFest tag
Di Maria scores a goal by helping the S.G.G. defeat the Malmö.
Angel de Maria, along with Blaise Matthewy and Edison Cavanaugh, celebrates the ball-bulls at the Malmö Gate.
Ángel de Maria, debuting at the League of Champions, scored a goal, which allowed the SGC to easily bypass the Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel de Maria and Edinson Cavanaugh did their job when the Paris Saint-Germain started their game at the League of Champions with a very convenient win of 2:0 versus Malmö at Park de Prence Stadium on Tuesday.
D. Maria scored less than four minutes after his first game at the League of Champions as a SGL player to guide the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their advantage when Cavanaugh scored a 61-minute goal.
Along with Real Madrid and the Donetsk "Shachter" in group A, Paris had to make a good start against Sweden's champions, as they did not aim to qualify the playoffs, but to continue the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovich useless in the attack and to replace him later on in a field game against a team from his hometown and club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or as a guest at the Champions League, so winning with a score of 2-0, delivering problems to rivals and playing great defenses is a good start, even if there are more things we'll have to do during the season," Blanc said.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, even though I wish we had scored one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovich returned after being injured in one of the replacements on the Paris team, bringing her a 2:2 draw in a match with Bordo in the First League on the weekend, but he was pushed back to the background by Di Maria at the fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker was recognized as a player capable of bringing the SGW to a new level in Europe after being bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran to pass from Marco Verratti behind Malmö's defense and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Villand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone expected the SGC to win a small and large victory then, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage with nine world-class players on the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two teambackers in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of Nicola Jurdzic's hit, where the ball flew past Kevin Trapp's 34th minute gate, they attacked very little.
At the same time, the SGC has sometimes failed itself with ineffective broadcasts and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovich, who in the first half alone failed to carry out at least five attempts, and then failed to process the ball that Kavani had beaten immediately after the game resumed.
Nevertheless, he proved to be much more skilled in precise pass, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovich, who, when he received the ball, D'Maria sent the ball with a twist, which went straight to the bar past Viland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after Cavanaugh's hourly mark, and the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovich fixed the ball sent to the center of the field with the left flank of Maxwell.
This put an end to any idea that Malmö had of returning to the game, and only by intercepting the ball by Viland at close range did David Louis not allow the final score to be increased before the replacement Esekiel Lavassi was counted as a goal at the end of the match.
Maleme Coach Age Hareida later admitted that the PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions was in December last year."
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, and that's not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Hail "Pari"!
It was a wonderful match with them.
Glancore makes $2.5 billion to sell shares.
The Swiss mining and trading giant Glencore, who suffered a fall in commodity prices, earned $2.5 billion to sell shares as part of its ambitious debt reduction plan.
Glancore, a London stock exchange company, announced that it had sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
A company that has lost 57 per cent of its market value is trying to cope with the collapse of commodity prices, while China’s recession worsens demand and creates chaos in world markets.
With the release of new shares at a discount price, Glencor's share rate on the London Stock Exchange rose early in the morning on Wednesday.
The shares jumped by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which was 0.69 per cent higher on opening.
Glancore started selling 2.5 billion dollars last week as part of extensive plans to reduce its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold new shares at 125 cents per unit, a discount of 2.4 percent at the close of the bidding on Tuesday.
It held 1.3 billion new shares, representing 9.99 per cent of the company's capital.
Fear of continuing recession in China’s economy has reduced the value of iron ore by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials have fallen by 20 to 40 per cent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
The White House confirmed in an official report on Tuesday that China’s head, Xi Jinping, would arrive on an official visit to the United States at the end of the month.
This visit, the first visit of Xi Qingping to Washington, will take place on 25 September and will be a return visit to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, will also welcome Xi Jinping and Peng Liyuan's wife to a government luncheon the same day after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
“President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to enhance cooperation between the US and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, as well as to enable US and Chinese Presidents to deal constructively with contentious issues”, the report states.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with the leaders of several leading American technology companies on his way to Washington, D.C., and then to New York to participate in the September UN General Assembly.
Obama and Xi Jingping are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about alleged cyberspying by China and China’s increasing rigour over the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
The man who killed the biker at the Kutuzovsky Lich received two years of colony.
In addition, the court partially granted the victims civil claims against Denis Mirzoev in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
The Moscow Road Court handed down a verdict against Denis Mirzoev, who shot and killed a motorcyclist on the Kutuzov prospectus in Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in a settlement colony.
He was found guilty under the article “Violation of traffic rules and the use of vehicles” of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
In addition, the court partially granted 1.2 million rubles of civil action by the victims.
During the deliberations of the parties, the prosecutor requested that Mirzoev be sentenced to three years ' imprisonment and that he recover the full amount of eight million rubles from the victims.
The accident in question took place on 22 May at around 3 a.m. in the vicinity of 30 Kutuzov Avenue.
The BMW, driven by Mirzoev, crossed the oncoming lane and hit a motorcyclist standing on the side of the road.
A man born in 1989 died on the spot as a result of his injuries.
The victim's friends on social media reported that the BMW driver was driving at a high speed and headed to the oncoming lane before the accident.
Fearing that the driver would attempt to escape responsibility, the bikers organized a motor race from the Sparrow Mountains to Moscow ' s HMSD building on Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it became known that the investigation had detained the alleged perpetrator of the accident following the interrogation.
In Moscow, a naked man entered the temple.
He acted calmly and did not commit any illegal acts, and the police handed him over to emergency psychiatric doctors.
The Metropolitan Police detained a Moscow resident who entered one of the temples without clothes.
That's what Moscow reports.
The incident occurred on Tuesday, 15 September, around 4 p.m., on the Kashir highway, according to the head of the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Moscow.
A naked man entered the temple of Saint Nicholas.
He behaved calmly and did not commit any illegal acts.
A police detail has arrived at the call site.
The law enforcement officers waited for doctors from the Emergency Mental Health Team and handed them over to a man.
It turned out to be a 26-year-old in Moscow.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev, Governor of the Tümensk Region, at the meeting of the Presidency of the Regional Government.
Some of them related to the allocation of funds to educational and health institutions in municipalities in the region.
In particular, funds have been allocated for the purchase of a bus for a school in Nizhnetawdin district and for the major renovation of a regional hospital in Kazan district.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the major renovation of the second floor of the therapeutic section.
The hot and cold water, drainage, power grids and electrical equipment, ventilation systems will be repaired, the facade of the building will be cleaned up, the premises will be renovated, and a range of fire safety and energy conservation measures will be implemented.
The second forum of the Russian and Belarusian regions will be held in Sochi.
From 17 to 18 September, the second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, with the participation of a Tumen delegation headed by the Governor.
The forthcoming event in Sochi and the intermediate outcome of the cooperation are described by the Honorary Consul-General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumeni Vladimir Shuglä, who was part of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the tasks of the Sochi Forum?
A large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on fruitful cooperation between regions, important links between the two States.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, are scheduled to participate in the plenary meeting.
The plenary and breakout sessions will focus on the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in implementing industrial policies, regulatory and legal provisions and programmes of the Federal State.
The Governor of the Tümensk Region will address the panel.
I think that demonstrates successful, sustained interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of line ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also be present.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tyumen region, will be available.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new and profitable contracts and agreements.
I would add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
It was attended by more than 200 delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important cooperation treaty was signed between the Tümensk and Minsk regions.
The importance of our work has also been demonstrated by the fact that a meeting of the permanent seminar of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumeni.
In addition, a delegation from the APC of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in agricultural training, identify additional points of contact and organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial sector.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with Vladimir Yakushev, Governor of the Tyumen region, the region ' s cooperation with the Republic of Belarus in today ' s difficult conditions was discussed.
Reference was made to the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms, which were needed to reduce the cost of machinery to the end-user.
Problems were discussed in the operation of the Belshin Tumen shopping house and options for preventing losses.
Important issues, as investment projects must work well and yield benefits to the region.
Reference was made to the further supply of passenger/cargo equipment by the OAO MAZ, and to the development of the OAO MAZ service centre, which was established in Tumeni by the OAO of the "TPAT".
The discussion also focused on the preparation of a working delegation from the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of the year.
Another topic of the discussion was the finalization and signing of an agreement on commercial, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the region of Tyumen and Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relationships promise to rise to a new level.
These questions also applied to the regional centre.
During a meeting with the city's chief of staff, Tumeni Alexander Moor, we talked about the renovation of the Tumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already breathing on the ladan, so a new batch of cars from Belarus are needed to operate on gas, cleaner fuels.
Another aspect: The Tyumen elevator plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of the OAO elevator products Mogilevliftmash, receiving components.
In my view, this activity could become more active, given the programmes to install new elevators in the regional centre.
I would add that, as part of the consul's expanded powers, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgansk region, Alexey Kokorin, during which discussions were held on increasing the flow of trade and the supply of modern Belarusian technology in Zaurala.
A meeting with the Omsk Governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The extended consular district consists of five constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but Tumen can be described as a district headquarters.
The region is a launching ground for many promising projects, including the work of the honorary General Consul.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good in that they allow many problems to be resolved directly and quickly, reducing their severity and promoting mutually beneficial cooperation.
Under the current circumstances, it is essential not to break the ground while continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in film production.
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, claiming backstage that there was no need to consider ethnic composition.
During the Sunday release of Project Greenlight on HBO, a famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black character in the script chosen for the project.
"Diversity is appropriate when you cast for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
"Wow, wow, well, well," while the Martian actor was commenting on the live air.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers.
"I'd like participants -- no matter who's directing -- to think about what version of Harmony they're going to stick to," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who gets beaten by a white pimp.
The film's producer, Dear White People, advocated that Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancacho should be the film's directors; Damon was strongly opposed to saying that "in the end, we may not get what we want."
After this discussion was broadcast on television, social networks exploded with disapproving comments about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni was angry about the video: "Clarifying the nature of Matt Damon's diversity to the only black person in the room that's so white that it hurts."
Tweet dialed over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "likes."
Damon's words appear at a time when a good coverage of a racial theme in the media is the most pressing issue on the public debate agenda.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by a policeman in 2014, Black Lives Matter became popular throughout the country, urging legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against coloured people.
In February, singer Prince mentioned this movement when he presented his nominees for the album of the year at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"The albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Most recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck as to whether this group would be regarded as a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter is a love group," reported the movement's leaders.
It was recently announced that Damon was on the list of show business personalities, producers and media magnates invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation or met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards the first champion.
A professional climber and assistant waiter, Isaac Caldiero, became the first winner of American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening, taking home a $1 million prize.
At this sports show, the seventh season of which has just ended, none of the participants has ever been able to complete all stages of the track with obstacles.
In the finals of the season, two contestants, Caldiero and cameraman Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a 75-foot rope lift in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to do the job and did the job, becoming the first athlete in the history of American Ninja Warrior to complete the exhausting stage 4, but Caldiero did the task three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After winning with tremendous effort, Caldiero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
"I've never made or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac commented to journalists E!
And all of a sudden... I never imagined how it could be... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed met with the Hollywood Reporter journalists to talk about the finale and why Britten, who was the first to pass the track, would not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the fastest participant gets the money.
"If there are more than one finisher, the prize gets the fastest of them," said Weed.
Although money is a wonderful reward and a change of life, it still gives him great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels bad about that.
He's happy with what he did.
He got tons of enthusiastic reviews from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was meant to lose, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
"America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will begin in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers are quietly bypassing the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS – The second half of the season wasn't much fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tigers, is now the last in the Central Division of the American League.
In an attempt to be a hindrance, Tigers won the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday, with a score of 5-4 on Targetfield.
Twins missed the chance to cut the Houston Astros gap by half, and get second in the playoffs in the number of points after the winners.
For Detroitans, even for one night, it was the return of the F-word, which eluded them most of the second half of the season.
"All the winnings are fun, no matter how they work," told Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
The Pitcher "Tigers" Alfredo Simon contributed to supporting the attacks, as a result of which Detroit scored three points in the first two innings, then added one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start in nine exits.
"I just want to end the year with good numbers," said Simon.
Pitchers don't get to quit in every game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
Victor Martinez, who was appointed to beat the Tigers, managed to strike three times and sustained two wounds - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three blows since the four strikes against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with the bat," said Osmus.
He did well in (the quality of the batter), noticeably better in the bat, and kept that quality for the game.
After getting three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance to get back in the game.
Central host Byron Buxton opened inning with a dubble on the left side of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, having made a bow, took the first base, and the second Baseman Brian Dozier got a strikeout from Simon before his left-handed Blaine Hardy took his place.
Hardy bypassed Moer, the only player on the road, before the newly appointed slaughtering Miguel Sano, who beat the double-range "single" to the left of Drew Verhagen's right-hand man.
With a couple of non-authentic runners comparing the wound at Ver Hagen's second base, he managed to lead Trevor Pluff's third basman to a double-playing.
It was the 27th time for a leading player in the major league this season when Pluff hit a double play.
After Detroit added the safety wounds in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned the RBI "double" in the space between the outsiders against Bruce Rondon's closing pitcher, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-wing player knocked Sano out after three strikes and received his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily unpracticed Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the list of injured until the game, missing more than a month due to lumbar inflammation.
"It's certainly not the start I'd like," Hughes said, "but as the game developed, I felt more comfortable, so I was able to do some pretty good shots in the third inning."
After the first batter got to the first base, Hughes threw the single at the second Baseman, Ian Kinsler.
Walker, on two outs of Wrightfielder J. D. Martinez, took Victor Martinez out, who made the single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez has finished his "0 in 21" series with the runners in the effective position.
Nick Castellanos, a third base player, followed by a "Single" with another wound, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to approach the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
Tigers increased the second-inning score by getting a single-out "double" from the catcher James McCann and a two-out "single" from the central chopper Anthony Goose, and what became 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes, whose throws were considered, threw a third inning in an untapped score, after which he was replaced by A. J. Achter, a right-handed revector.
Hughes had three wounds on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Anibal Sanchez, the right-hand peach of Tigers, left the players due to the sprain of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed a shoulder surgery on Sanchez as early as 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the trauma list since mid-August, is scheduled to be released on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, the left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the list of traumatised and go against Twins.
Norris, who was released from the Tigers in four places from his acquisition in exchange for David Price's left-handed pitcher on July 30, has one victory and one defeat.
He has not participated in the games since August 20, due to the sprain of the braid muscle.
Tigers and Twins will complete a series of three games at Targetfield on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will be played by the right pitcher Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
Kadyrov's original complaint about the book "The Molba to God" went to the South Sahel court.
The South Sahel City Court received the original appeal from President Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov against the decision to recognize “extremist material” of the book “Molba to God: its meaning and place in Islam”, reports Interfax with reference to the Chairman of the Gorsud Alexander Chuhray.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the litigants.
Chuhrai refused to comment on the statements made by some members of the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the need to test the Gorda for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIL.
"Let them themselves comment on such foolishness," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sahel City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalia Perchenko's decision to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
An appeal from the South Sahalinsk Public Prosecutor's Office was filed on Friday night.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes they've asked the court to declare extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, not the Koranic Signs.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the judge made the wrong decision”, Chuhrai reported.
The decision to recognize the book as “extremist material” was taken on 12 August 2015.
In particular, quotes from the Quran - “We worship you and we pray for Your help” - were called “extremist” and “Do not call upon anyone besides God.”
Kadyrov called the book's decision-makers "shitans and provocateurs."
He called on members of the State Duma to prohibit by law judicial decisions concerning the texts of sacred writings.
“I firmly believe that the State Duma must pass a law that prohibits judicial decisions that directly affect the texts of the Koran and other divine writings,” Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will delete comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook staff intends to remove posts and comments that disapprove migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect users ' complaints about illegal content.
The Facebook leadership intends to work with the German Ministry of Justice to combat xenophobia and racism on the network.
For example, the previous day, the head of the department, Haiko Maas, had stated that the Ministry of Justice was currently working with social media specialists to establish a special team of moderators.
Participants are required to monitor and remove incorrect comments on migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, it is expected that the authors of the intolerant posts will be notified of the reason for their deletion.
Organizations whose specialists collect complaints from social media users about offensive posts should also facilitate the rapid blocking of illegal content.
Facebook management intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative remarks against migrants and refugees, the social network management and the German Ministry of Justice had been taken after xenophobic attitudes had risen sharply in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for this was the unprecedented migration crisis that gripped the EU some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all refugee shelters are already overcrowded.
The day before, the authorities had decided to temporarily settle migrants in the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Internally displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war are held under the Nazi regime.
Moscow's cemeteries will have relaxing zones.
In the near future, several cemeteries in the capital will be equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
The first will be Butovski, Domodedovski, and Shcherbinsk Cemetery.
The first psychological recreation zone has already appeared at the Troekurovsk cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar plots will appear in other parts of the city.
Artem Ekimov, the head of the State Budget Institution “Ritual”, told the portal m24.ru.
Relaxation zones will be small green areas that resemble parks.
According to experts, in such “coals”, visitors to cemeteries will be able to rest, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovski, Butovski and Shcherbina cemeteries and then in other parts of the capital.
According to the head of the Ritual GBW, if there is a need to expand the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forests to the maximum extent possible.
Green plantations will serve as a living fence that will separate the recreational areas and the squares that are placed directly into burial sites.
The Ritual experts also indicated their intention to propose the removal of fences at burial sites.
New cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the Ritual Office has indicated its willingness to install electronic terminals through which visitors to cemeteries will be able to recognize GPS coordinates and burial plates.
In June of this year, Ritual also proposed that the cost of burial services be adjusted according to the season.
So, digging graves in summertime will cost a thousand rubles less, in winter, when the ground is frozen.
Note that over the past year, prices for all ritual services have been at an average cost of 10 per cent.
Five days later, a lost fungus was found in the forests of Selnin.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without food.
It was the joint efforts of rescue workers and volunteers that made it possible to discover the mountain mound.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent, "79-year-old retired from the Tambovsk region spent five days in the woods."
No food or water.
He was sought by relatives, rescue workers, volunteers.
There were even canine scientists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was found after the helicopter was involved in the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the woods to collect Optas and picks, but did not return by the evening.
Relatives immediately sought help, and as soon as the next day, rescue workers and interested residents from a neighbouring village — only about 30 people — were raised in search of the fungus.
They were joined by a fire and rescue centre helicopter for the fifth day.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the Smolensk District Fire and Rescue Centre, said, "The helicopter was engaged, the man was found."
He's gone a long way, somewhere else.
It was about 12 kilometers from the search site.
He went a long way at his age.
It's a miracle that's alive.
The fungus was taken to the central district hospital in Selnin, unconscious, in extremely poor condition.
Medics diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia.
How an elderly man managed to survive after five days in the forest, doctors have no idea.
Valentina Nepsha, director of the therapeutic department of the Helnine CRS: "A patient's examination, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all of his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition has improved this morning, and it's still difficult, but it's positive.
The pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich comes to Smolenshchina every year from the Tambovsky region.
His grandson says his grandfather used to go to pick mushrooms, but he never went far into the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, grandson of the fungus found, said, "The forest is near the road, not really local."
Just for a few years, he came to visit his family.
So I went to get some mushrooms.
I guess I went a little far and got lost.
As the fungus season begins, people are regularly lost in all parts of Smolen oblast.
In the last few days alone, there have been five similar cases.
The rescuers remind us that we need to walk into the forest in bright clothes, with little food, matches, and compasses.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces behind so that we can go back.
Accidental An-2 sat on a screen in a brother's taiga.
Right on the grid in Siberia, the emergency AN-2.
An emergency landing was carried out by the Krasnoyar airline Enisei, 68 kilometres from Bratsk.
There were no casualties, but the plane itself sustained significant damage upon landing.
An-2 was on a service flight.
He was on board three crew members, a commander, a co-pilot and a flight mechanic, reported to Interfax.
The crash plane flew between Zheleznogorsk and Ilimsk and Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The plane crew has already arrived in Bratsk.
The Brotherly Transport Prosecutor ' s Office, after an emergency landing, has begun to verify compliance with air safety legislation.
An investigative team from the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office travelled to the scene of the incident.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed its aircraft with passengers due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned tagging airfield in Komi.
The ship's engines and on-board electronics failed, but the crew made the impossible.
The aircraft was manned by 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was injured in an emergency landing.
Economics - Nobel Laureate: Globalization
The processes of globalization should have contributed to reducing inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, and the income gap in developing economies is increasing.
Eric Muskin.
In order to remedy this, it is necessary to improve the education of low-skilled workers, according to the chief researcher at the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Solutions of the NEU, Nobel Prize laureate in Economics 2007, Eric Muskin.
The world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets over the past 20 years.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," says Muskin.
China and India, for example, have experienced strong GDP growth per capita.
However, things are not as bright as they are.
Globalization was expected to narrow the gap between the “poor” and the “poor” in poor countries, which was reflected in large income inequalities, or more specifically, pay.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, as Eric Muskin points out in his article “Why Global Markets did not reduce inequality in emerging economies”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which the NIEs have translated and quoted.
Together with an economist, Professor Michael Kremer of Harvard University, Eric Muskin has developed an alternative theory that shows why income disparities in poor countries are widening as globalization increases, similar to the NEE.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Muskin distinguishes four levels of expertise - A and B for rich countries, C and D for poor countries.
After globalization, D professionals from poor countries lack the skills to work with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if level C workers from poor countries are getting their wages raised by collaborating with rich B workers, then D workers are not growing or their wages are falling altogether.
The net effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to the widening of the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thus increase inequality.
Kremer and E. Muskin are offering an amazingly beautiful model, an alternative to the ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fouad Aleskerov, an honorary professor, head of the International Analysis and Decision Making Laboratory, head of the NEU Department of Mathematics.
And as a powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge in empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Muskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, according to the scientist, the employees themselves have no means to do so, and it is not cost-effective for companies to pay for their training.
In this situation, Governments, international agencies, NCBs and private foundations, Maskin believes, can play a significant role.
The scholar notes that the theory developed does not in any way call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has produced and is bearing fruit in terms of the growth of countries' GDP.
Derbent: The living bond of the times.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, celebrates his 2000th anniversary in September.
The celebration programme includes the Dagestan Festival of National Cultures and a past-time fair, the Derbent carpet exhibition and the Day of Open Temples, the historic and music show "2000 Years in Two Hours" and the guided tour of the reconstructed Petra I Museum.
The medieval stones of the Naryn Kala fortress, the ancient Arab inscriptions on the walls, the narrow streets and the palace gardens, it's like they came from the pages of the Thousand and One Night.
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has survived since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Hazar kaganat and the Golden Ordha.
The age of the eastern culinary, which grows in the courtyard of Derbent Juma Mosque, is several centuries old.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian programme “Wilds - Monuments of Wildlife”.
The shadow of the scattered kroner saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
A visitor to the mosques will be given a fragrance of tea and will be served with Dagestanian treats - honey figs, persimmons, musmoules, miracle cakes, Ayran and sweets.
In Derbent, for centuries, they have used large samovars to get a cup of tea for many visitors.
The inscription above the entrance to Juma Mosque says the building was built in 115 hijra.
That is, in 733, the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is astounding in scale and solemnity: the arcade of domes and vaults are based on a square column and lighted by the sun from tiny windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is a traditional hobby of Derbent's people.
The owners of the pet birds put pigeons in the courtyards, under the trees, in the attics.
It's exciting to see a pack of white pigeons flying into the sky, like the flashes of the holiday fireworks.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians closed the Caspian gate with a double stone wall.
As it sailed 500 metres into the sea, the structure locked Derbent's harbor.
In 2003, Derbent's serfs were placed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification.
The carpets in Derbent were weaving in the fifth century, and until now the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the urban market, carpets are sold for any taste - coats of wool, cotton, or wolfs of all colours and shades, with or without a thief, with a complex pattern and a whimsical border.
The construction of the city began with the magals — blocks with single-storey stone structures.
Over the years, the Magals have barely changed.
Only satellite plates, air conditioners on walls, and street lights remind you that you're not in a medieval city, but in a modern city.
In the old part of town, there were parts of a pipe built by the Persians about a thousand years ago.
To this day, ancient sources have come to the point where locals are still gaining water.
Many derbents prefer regular tap water from proven historical fountains.
Derbent had one of the centres of the pottery trade.
The watering and writing vases, dishes, jugs, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of potters are still making wonderful ceramics for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On the holidays and festivals, crowds of viewers gather under a tight cable, which is attended by students from the Republican School of circus art.
The history of remarkable and risky skill has been in existence for centuries.
The new trend is that there are more and more girls among the cable walkers.
There's an Ancient Derbent Museum in the ex-Virgin bath house today.
In the past, single girls and brides were bathed here, accompanied by friends, and now anyone who wants to see a short and dome hall, hot and cold swimming pools, which are past bathing supplies.
Most Derbent's houses have hot water, but baths and couples are as popular today as they used to be.
The benefits of being warmed up by steam are written in ancient books.
After the bath, blood improves, muscles become tired, and the body becomes flexible and light.
The "Commonwealth" festival, which takes place in the Naryn Kala fortress, is attended by ethno-substitutes from many parts of Dagestan.
The participants in the national costumes dance, play folk tunes, sing songs from the Caucasus people, and provide visitors with delicious home cheese.
Kyrchlar is a burial ground for 40 martyrs who have lost their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most respected complexes for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
The yellowed sarcophagus are carved out of whole stone blocks and oriented, as is customary in Arabs, along the west-east axis.
The Gavril brothers and Albert Yacubova shave their clients in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The hairdresser's office has been here for years.
Circumstances are passed on from generation to generation.
In doing so, the Yacubov brothers can make not only traditional but also modern hairstyles.
There was a house on one of the streets of the Old City where Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, a dekabrist writer exiled to the Caucasus, lived.
After learning the Turkic language and collecting ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, life and living conditions.
The Chaihan is a traditional club in the East where only tea and homemade pastries are served.
Men come here to drink, talk to their friends, and solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not encouraged to cross the tea threshold.
The Derbent dance ensemble "Caspius" was created three years ago, but has already taken part in activities at the national and Russian levels.
Allists of the ensemble rehearse every day, perfecting the people's Avar, Dargin, Tata and Armenian dances.
As the evening comes, when noise and street lights come down, locals sit in shops near houses with terraces.
In general, Derbents discuss matters at home.
But in the run-up to the anniversary, they are increasingly reminiscing of episodes of their city’s unique history, which has affected the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
In Domodedov, there was a business game for the airport.
The capital is experiencing a new form of education.
Four hundred students tried to be airport employees.
For this purpose, Domodedov installed models of three aircraft.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also served the planes.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but by its complexity it has not fallen short of reality.
Late flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the stairs lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport, it's hell.
For the one who settled in Domodedova's hangar, the standard set of tasks to be done by the newcomers.
There were three major airports in one hangar from around the world.
They now employ 400 students from colleges and universities in the capital.
Unprecedented chance to learn everything about the internal world of the airline.
Passenger registration, aircraft service, luggage turnover - they were even entrusted with buses in the flight field, stairs, and passenger searches.
And passengers are a lot of trouble.
One's got a bad ID, the other's late for the flight, and the other's filled the bag with suspicious items.
And it all needs to be dealt with, like in life, within a minimum period of time.
For each of these tasks performed, it is charged a certain amount, virtual money, as if it had been paid by the airline for the services it provided.
"For failure to do so, they are fined," explains financial analyst Dmitri Hilko in an interview with Vesti-Moscow.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely following the situation.
For them, this exam is an attempt to test a new form of learning.
She's already found a place in secondary vocational education.
“Six interregional centres of competence will be established, which will in fact become new models for the activities of modern colleges with modern management systems, with highly qualified personnel and with modern equipment”, explains the Director of State Policy in the area of training of workers and additional vocational education of the Ministry of Science of Russia, Natalia Zolotarev.
But students don't have global plans.
After three days of training like this, they're gonna need a day off.
At the same time, the scores for the examination were quite material.
The latest smart-glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding in a timely manner to our Instagram airport," was pleased by the player in the game, the PR manager of Frankfurt Airport, Sergei Shuvalov.
The best judges, what's called, are on pencils to be invited to work by the time they finish their studies.
The US Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the foreign literature library of the United States centre.
The Centre worked in Moscow for over 22 years.
The United States Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the Russian Government's unilateral decision to close the United States Embassy Center at the All-Russian M.I. Rudomino State Library in Moscow.
“The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times call into question the commitment of the Russian Government to the links between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the cold war and other difficult moments in the long history of our relations,” states the statement by Ambassador John Tefft of the United States of America to Interfax.
The American Centre has built deep and strong ties between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was a centre of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American personalities, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Only last year, the American Centre held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50,000 Russian visitors”, the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-United States project, the FLEX Educational Exchange Programme (Future Leaders Exchange Programme).
The Green Tribunal was quick to execute.
A typical situation is that four officials stand in front of Judge Swatanter Kumar's desk, listening to his complaints about the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to make fun of him, said Kumar.
If there's any more bricks, we'll have to take down all the buildings.
Kumar is the head of the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
Since then, the Tribunal has dealt with more than 10,000 claims relating to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decided to discontinue the pollution-producing construction.
The stakes are incredibly high: in the incomplete 60 years that have elapsed since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development, India has become one of the most overcrowded and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large mega-cities, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and few remaining housing estates are destroyed by new residential neighbourhoods.
Despite formal government support for the green movement, NZT is regularly criticized by the Narendra Modi Government, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May this year, for example, the Minister of the Environment called the court's decisions “extreme” and “unenforceable”.
Sometimes it is not possible to execute the court ' s decisions within the time limit set by the court, as confirmed by the environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
Unable to do so, however, there is also a positive side: at least they force those responsible to move.
"His main goal is to shake this system," adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has on several occasions cancelled major construction projects: the cessation of the construction of the airport, the power plant and hundreds of smaller facilities.
They also try to keep people in mind — for example, when discussing the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagana, which polluted the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we're also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," commented Kumar.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can be changed by the single hand of a judge.
Thus, in April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, causing public outrage.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to reverse the decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the New Delhi Government on incoming and outgoing vehicles and also offered to purchase 10,000 additional buses, first knowing at the factories whether they were able to carry out such an order.
As pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to fall into the court’s attention, popular anger began to subside.
But the most ill subject of the principled judge was the Gang River Clean-up program announced last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
When it comes to Ganga, a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often stops controlling his emotions and starts screaming.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges onto God's statue, and there were feces in it, the judge is hot.
You keep contaminating the river because you think Gang is Gang, he'll take all our sins.
It's the river we worship, and look what you do to it every day.
The clean-up of the Gang is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new Government.
The number of fecal bacteria in the river is now more than 120 times higher.
Every year, between 1.5 and 3 out of 700 million Indian bathers die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Ganges Rescue Fund from the sale of his suit, in which he met with Barack Obama and 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the premiere of populism: the suit was bought for $700,000, while the river cleaning takes at least eight billion.
The proponents of the Green Tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the cost of progress should be the environment.
“In a developing country, talk about the environment is often perceived as an unaffordable luxury,” says Malika Bhanoth, an activist at the Ganga.
And the court is trying to find the right balance between the environment and development."
A man bled a few Dalí paintings at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the exhibition of the Latvian Union of Artists in Riga broke the windows of the museum and ruined Salvador Dalí's "Engineage" sculpture.
El Salvador Dalí and Pablo Picasso are now holding an exhibition at the museum.
A man born in 1985 entered the sculpture hall at 2:20 p.m.
He immediately did not behave properly: he ruined the sculpture, broke the windows.
He then started moving around the premises and stained blood with several permanent exhibits.
Among them is a portrait of the Hand of Miervaldis Polis.
According to the President of the Latvian Union of Artists, Igor Dobochin, referred to by Interfax, the windows were also damaged.
There are police and art experts on the scene.
The latter determine the extent of damage and damage.
A criminal case of hooliganism has been initiated against a man.
In the Latvian Union of Artists, an exhibition of Picasso and Dalí works took place from 4 August to 27 September, at which more than 200 original works by artists were presented.
Commentator Gennady Orlov has been hospitalized in Spain.

Where can I leave a review of the work of the bailiff in Murmansk?
The Office of the Federal Service of Magistrates for the Murmansk Region reported that it had a book of feedback and suggestions to improve the protection of the rights and legitimate interests of citizens and organizations.
It allows citizens to leave a record of the quality of the work of bailiffs and other officials of the administration, information on the shortcomings of the work, and to express their suggestions and wishes.

Xi Jinping calls for making the economy more open to the world
The economy must become more open to the world in order to boost its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in his address to the group charged with leading the reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing an open policy”, he said, referring to the 16th meeting of the Central Lead Group on Comprehensive Reform.
He said that greater openness and reform would give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including regulation of investors ' access to the market, change of border controls, promotion of public enterprises (SOE) attracting private capital and revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list would be drawn up of sectors of the economy and production that were not available for investment.
The system will gradually be fine-tuned through trial programs.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, the establishment of the rule of law in the business sphere and the promotion of openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government would also weaken control over the powers granted to companies, thereby guaranteeing that companies would run their own businesses.
The statement also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of government-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The Government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign finance companies as well as provide them with better conditions”, the statement says.
The procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or “green Card”, would be further facilitated by optimizing requirements and simplifying the process of submission itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Lee Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
