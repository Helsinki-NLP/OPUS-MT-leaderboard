I want to address all political commentators, political scientists, talk shows.
There's no need to demonize the people of Khabarovsk.
There are industrious and wonderful people living here, as Michael Degtarev said.
In an interview, Degtyarev recalled that he was a member of the LDPR and a one-party Furgala and added that he wished him luck in court, and that the party and the individual Vladimir Zhirinovsky would support the trial.
The full text of the interview was published on the KP.ru website.

Semilarski v. Prosecutor ' s Office: the cassation of former Vice-Mayor Tartu will be considered on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided in early September.
The courts of the first two courts refused to hear the case, but in April his cassation appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant, as her authorization did not fall within the competence of the administrative court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for damages in criminal proceedings.
“The prosecutor's office and the county court are responsible for regulating such matters”, was previously explained to ERR correspondent Annette Kraitsmann, press secretary for the Tartu courts.
She states that Valvo Similardski appealed the decision to the District Court, which did not change the decision of the Court of First Instance on 5 February.
Now the State will have to say its word.
According to Similarski's defence counsel, the juror Oliver Nyaes, his client had been unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
He now demands that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office refute the incorrect allegations against him and compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for the complaint to the court was the statements made by the Prosecutor for Special Cases of the Luuna District Prosecutor's Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilárski, along with another then Vice-Mayor Tartu Artum Suvorov, was arrested on suspicion of having committed several crimes.
“Remember that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that Tartu's leaders, one of the most influential bodies of local self-government, were corrupt.
These public suspicions hanging in the air have accompanied me for about two years.
Now that these allegations and suspicions have proved to be false, the Public Prosecutor's Office has nothing to say about them,” commented Semilárski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Neez, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecution should operate.
"The allegation of bribery and corruption has been false, but it's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia as well as on Lithuania that, during the investigation phase, State representatives must be careful in choosing words so that suspects are not represented as criminals before sentencing.
The Public Prosecutor's Office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which unfortunately has not been respected in this case against Valvo Semilárski,” Neez said.
“Semilarsky's public representation as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified are unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfairly towards the complainant”, added counsel.
As rus.err.ee wrote, former Vice-Mayor Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted for bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, a former official is tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption law in transactions of a particularly large size.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than 30 times in the meetings of the city authorities in making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu with whose owners or leaders the Semilarski actively interacted at the personal level outside working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilárski had a personal interest, so he had to withdraw from decision-making.
Previously, as rus.err.ee wrote, the Public Prosecutor's Office had raised suspicions of bribery and anti-corruption law violations in high-value transactions.
This occurred in October 2016, when he was arrested together with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centralist Party).
At that time, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both Vice-Mayors.
Both officials then resigned.
The Suvorov case later reached a court that fully justified politics.
The investigation into the case of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.
The ex-sololist of the "Rookie Up" group visited the Tver Oblast
The ex-soleist of the "Rookie Up" group, and now a solo artist, businessman and actor, Sergei Zhukov, has posted a photograph in his official Instagram account from Kalyazine of the Tver Oblast.
Photo published a day ago, Saturday, July 25th.
"I raise my hands to the new Baby and say hi to you with a drunken fresh air!
What's the weather in your town?
We don't have rain today, but it's not up 20's yet," the Zhukov writes on social media.
The singer may be resting with his family in the beautiful city of the Tver region.
Residents of the region have already thanked the performer for his visit and have expressed their hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Baby" referred to in the post is probably due to a new version of the old song that Zhukov has now written with blogger and musician David Manukian (DAVA M).
Most fans, however, remain behind the old version: "Sergey, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
Support me with the loyal fans of Hands Up, "We don't need a new baby."
Most people write directly that the original, which had become a hit in the past, liked it better.

According to S.E., Alexey Miranchuk is currently on the Locomotive's semi-defendant for the A-series "Milan", "Latio", "Fiorentina" and "Atalanta".
A 24-year-old footballer would like a four-year contract with a salary of at least 2 million euros a year with bonuses.

In the 2019/20 season, Miranchuk played 32 games per railwayman, scored 16 goals and 5 assists.
Along with Locomotive, Havbek became Russia's champion (2017/18), won the country's Cup three times (2014/15, 2016/17, 2018/19) and once the Russian Super Bowl (2019).
The US called on Qatar and its neighbours to end the dispute.
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other nations, according to the US Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook.
He said that the conflict between the Emirate and other countries in the region had lasted too long and was detrimental to regional interests in the areas of stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a dispute that Washington views as “a threat to efforts to contain Iran”.
Diplomatic relations with Qatar ended three years ago with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
They imposed a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, in Doha, it was stated that neighbours were simply jealous of Qatar’s economic success – according to the IMF, Qatar has had a strong lead in per capita GDP for several years.
The Emirates is the third largest exporter of natural gas, the sixth exporter of natural gas and the largest exporter of petroleum and petroleum products.

This was announced on Friday by Daniel Russell, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific.

Pompeo called for an end to the long-standing approach to interaction with China and for the creation of a "new alliance" to force China to change in line with Washington’s wishes.

How the CD’s decision to reduce the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to reduce the key stake again.
It dropped by a further 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% of the annual - formally another historical minimum.
Based on the return of a short cut in the rate, as well as the tone of the CD’s statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator is more optimistic about the economic outlook than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing may soon stop.
“We have continued to relax monetary policy, especially considering that there are still risks of inflation falling from 4% in 2021,” reported the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvir Nabyullin.
They are linked to a significant decline in economic activity and a decline in domestic and external demand.
The economic recovery, according to Nabyullin, will take more than a year and a half.
She noted, however, that following the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes had been revitalized: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand had been restored, construction and production of consumer goods had increased, and the annual rate of decline in transport and production had slowed.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, the economy will be reduced by 4.5-5.5 per cent in 2020 (a pre-expected 4-6%) and the recovery of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5 per cent and 2.5-3.5 per cent in 2022.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per Urals barrel in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Previously, the CB expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the inflation forecast of the Bank of Russia for 2020 was 3.7 to 4.2 per cent, compared with the previously expected 3.8 to 4.8 per cent.
The Bank’s view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the cycle of easing, as Russian and CIS economists “Renaissance Capital” Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko consider.
For example, the Bank of Russia consistently lowers a key rate for over a year; since the beginning of last summer, it has fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the CD reduced it by one percentage point because of low inflation due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate a stagnant economy caused by the pandemic and its associated constraints.
The chances for monetary policy adjustment persist (at the next meeting on 18 September and until the end of the year), but the limit is close, and the chief analyst, Rosbank Evgeny Cochelev, agrees.
The combination of inflationary risks also points to the proximity of a pause in reducing interest-rate policies - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to prevention measures, and faster (than expectations) recovery of demand, he says.
In addition to the subsequent actions of the Bank of Russia, greater attention will need to be paid to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as to the external volatility that has increased in the context of geopolitical conflicts, Coselev points out.
In one way or another, a reduction in the key rate will further reduce the rates for the most reliable borrowers, and perhaps also, on mortgage, says the senior economist at the Open Bank's think tank, Maxim Petronevich.
The adjustment of the rates would be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he clarified.
Demand rates may fall another 0.3 to 0.6 percentage points in the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2 to 7 per cent, without excluding the BCS Premier economist Anton Kactovic.
Average deposit rates, in his view, would also fall - in the coming months they could fall to 4.2-4.5 per cent (now barely above 4.5 per cent).

Survey: The ruling Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania has once again taken over party rankings
The Union of Farmers and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the governing coalition of the Seimas, has led the party rankings.
This was demonstrated by a survey conducted by Wilmorus Por social research company to order a newspaper called Lietuvos ritas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, the peasants lost their first place and for a long time led Russia's main critic in Lithuania, opposition to the Union of Motherland - Christian Democrats (conservatives).
Recently, however, President Gitanas Nausseda of Lithuania, in assessing the party's electoral capabilities, stated that the Union of Farmers and Greens, after this year's parliamentary elections, would probably be able to form a coalition again.
This statement provoked resentment on the part of the conservatives.
The latest survey showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 per cent of voters would vote for peasants and 17.2 per cent for conservatives.
According to Director Wilmorus Vladas Gajdes, the breakup is within the limits of error, yet the rulers have stopped falling behind the conservatives.
According to Gadisse, the sociological success of peasants has been facilitated by the news that Prime Minister Saulus Skvernys will lead their electoral list.
This politician was the first on the list of peasants and in the 2016 elections.
In third place, the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 per cent of respondents are now willing to vote.
She suddenly lost 2 percent for the mesh.
Fourth, the Labour Party, headed by a Russian businessman, Victor Uspassky (6.2 per cent).
The remaining political organizations, according to the survey, will not be able to overcome the 5 per cent electoral barrier.

The draft law is in implementation of the road map for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-sized Entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation up to 2030, approved by the Government.

This was due to the redistribution of milk by the processing plant to farm farms.
As a result, the rate of acceptance of products from cooperatives has declined.
The head of the region instructed the Acting Minister of Agriculture to take up the field, study the milk distribution structure, analyse the experience of other territories and identify solutions.

The Moscow authorities reported on the fate of the closed dumps
Solid municipal waste sites continue to be closed down in Moscow.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being upgraded to modern landfills.
But this option is not possible for every range, many of which have been abandoned by a dense housing development.
Once the range closes, it rises to recultivation - the body of the range is soiled, gas-free systems are installed, and infiltration systems are installed.
This makes it possible to stop chemical processes inside the landfill so that it does not ignite, fertilize or poison the soil or groundwater.
And then the former dump remains to be raised by a wasteful pile of its surrounding housing.
Why don't we make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruze, where the rehabilitation of the Annino site was completed just the other day, the authorities are considering making a mountain slope out of a pile.
The site, which was used from 1976 to 2016, grew beyond the boundaries of the land allocated to it.
Therefore, during the recovery, it was necessary to buy out neighbouring sites that had been de facto packed with garbage for a long time.
"Sometimes it'll pass, "the range will fit, "we'll find the fortresses, "and we'll think we can do something to make it work.
“A ski resort is striking,” Nikolai Parthenov, the chief of the Ruz district, told journalists.
Two sites will be renewable energy sites
The Torbeevo polygons in the Luberts and Timohovos in the Obrod district will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy from landfill and biological gases.
At the end of the year, a gas-pumping power plant capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year and some 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy will be launched in the territory of Torbeeva, which will provide for the site's own needs, namely the heating of administrative and production facilities.
Timohovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste treatment plant.
And a museum could be set up at the Kuchino Balashhin site, which was closed after residents complained about the Line with the President of the country.
“It was the idea to create a museum for the rehabilitation of the Podskovya polygons,” reported the Deputy Minister of the Government, Dmitry Kurakin, Minister of Ecology and Environmental Management.
Israel reported a drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli army drone landed in southern Lebanon.
The armed forces reported that it collapsed “in the course of operational activities”.
The reasons for the fall of the apparatus are not reported.
“A little while operating at the border with Lebanon, an Israeli army drone landed in Lebanese territory.
There's no risk of leaking information," says the Israeli army's Twitter report.
Let us recall that this week the Israeli army decided to strengthen its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing the revenge of the Lebanese Hezbollah movement for the killing of its fighters in Syria.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah promised not to ignore the death of any of his “brothers”.
More on the situation - in "I" Israel awaits Hezbollah's revenge.

The Vrio of the Governor of Khabarovsk province, Mikhail Degtjarev, joined the parties for the first time since his appointment in support of the arrested ex-head of the Sergei Furgal region.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, so she sent you a Vrio so the region wouldn't collapse without power... "I repeat: "He's my comrade, "b" is one-party, "c" is very concerned about his fate, "the party's helping him, handing him food, "Girinovsky's knocking in every office," said the governor's Vrio.
According to Degtyarev, the Khabarovsk Krai cannot remain without a leader now, so he was appointed, by decree of President Vladimir Putin, to head the region so that “a wonderful building (the government of the province) will function, everything will work, the budget will be spent on social needs.”
The governor's Vrio explained that he had not visited the protestors before because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
So he's broadcasting on social media and reading all the comments on them.
On 25 July, two consecutive protests took place in Khabarovsk.
Concertations in support of the former Governor have been taking place in the region since 11 July.
On the eve of another action, Mikhail Degtyarev announced that he would leave town on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters and called for a statement on the fate of the arrested ex-Governor of the Furgal.
Degtarev had previously refused to go to the shareholders.
"There's really something to do about the manager than to go out and talk to people screaming outside the window," said the governor's vario.

The beautiful high minarets just decorated Aya-Sofia.
Once again, about Aya Sofia, there's a text about Vladimir Zelinski, which, I say, needs to be protested.
First of all, there's a free entrance - hooray!
I haven't been to Istanbul, but a free entrance to the House of God is better than a fee.
Secondly, Muslims have just as honestly conquered this land as the Orthodox conquered the Volgo-Occa interreature, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
Godspeed!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
We're gonna give it all back to everyone?
You don't think there's any pagans who would want their capitula back, which is where the Tenth Church belongs?
Thirdly, Muslims have improved the building and invested in it.
I mean, it's just like the factories and estates that the Leninians took from the bourgeois to own, it's owned by the Leninians, Putin and other nomenclatures.
They've improved everything, from the Kremlin to Angara, so it's all their right progressors.
The beautiful high minarets have very decorated Aya-Sofia, very much.
There was a stupid ink maker, and there was a stupid ink maker with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no “Islamic” or “Orthodox” civilizations.
There are some who believe, some who are hypocrites, and some who associate faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in categories of civilization does not think.
It's the thinking of British Mida Toinby's official, a believer who's ashamed to think that way.
And to a believer everywhere is a place of prayer.
Always.
And he who believes does not pray except from where he is asked to go, and goes away and prays there.
He is a believer, not a champion.
We're the stakes, not the grindstones.

A Rwandan admitted to setting fire to the Cathedral in Nantes.
A Rwandan who worked at St. Peter's and Paul's Cathedral in the French city of Nantes voluntarily confessed to burning him a week after the fire.
That's what France 3 is reporting on Sunday.
According to him, a man who had already been detained on 19 July, the day after the fire, had been detained again the previous day.
On Saturday night, he appeared before the investigating judge.
After being charged with wilful damage to property, the man admitted that he had set fire to three places - under a large organ, under a small organ, and at the electric fence.
He now faces up to 10 years in prison and 150,000 euros in fines.
The motives for the actions of a 39-year-old Rwandan had not yet been reported.
All he knows is that he volunteered to help in the cathedral and was supposed to close his doors on the day of the fire.
However, according to security footage, he left a religious institution 15 minutes after receiving calls about a fire in the building.
The fire in the Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul took place on 18 July.
Over 200 firefighters fought for a monument of Gothic architecture for several hours.
Nevertheless, they failed to save the stained windows of the time of Louis XII and the unique organ of the Baroque era.
It was only three hours after the fire started that the situation was brought under control.
No one was injured in the incident.
The current fire isn't the first time the temple has existed.
In 1972, the fire destroyed his roof.
It took 13 years to recover from that fire.
It was not until 1985 that the cathedral was reopened to the parishioners.

Alexander Dukov, President of the Russian Football Union (RFS), believes that it is wrong to expand the Russian Premier League (RPF) to 18 teams at the moment.
"First of all, it was an RPL decision, but I'll take it because it's wrong to change the rules after the tournament is over.
It violates the integrity of the tournament and the principle of sports.
And certainly this decision would not have been supported by UEFA or FIFA,” Dukov said after the final of the Russia Cup "Zenit" - "Khimki" (1:0).
There are currently 16 clubs in the RPF, but an option was considered to increase the number of teams to 18.

Kirilenko shared memories of the NBA games with Bryant and Jordan
The head of the Russian Basketball Federation (RFF), Andrei Kirilenko, shared his memories of his games against legendary Koby Bryant and Michael Jordan in National Basketball Association (NBA) matches.
I knew Bryant's ego couldn't be hit with some kind of clot, so I wouldn't stimulate his athletic anger.
Koby had the killer's instinct, so on the set, I tried to talk to him so he wouldn't take the game aggressively.
On the set, I gave him a compliment, "Oh!
Kobi, good score, good pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic feedback, he forgot a little bit about taking the ball and picking up another three or four points.
We've been in good contact with Kobi, and I quote Kirilenko as "The Night Moscow."
He also told me about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match, I ran in complete admiration that there was a legend next to me that I only saw on TV.
As long as I had a heart attack, Michael scored a lot of points.
Soon I walked away from the sedation, a couple of times I caught his throws...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points," added the head of the RFB.

The Sahalin-1 project is implemented through a product-sharing agreement, with Exxon Neftegas Ltd as the project operator with 30%, another 20% for Rosnefti, Japanese Sodeco 30% and Indian ONGC 20%.
The Khabarovsk region has been acquiring gas from this project since 2005.

The actor in the Russian series responded to the charges of "promotion of LGBT and Feminism"
The actor in the Russian series "Chicky", whose creators were accused of "promotion of LGBT and Feminism", responded to complaints about the film.
The authors “recognized the urgency of the issues raised and did not want to offend anyone,” said the American Stephen Thomas Oxner in a conversation with The Rise.
"I think it's a story about the power and the general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said an actor who played the father of a boy who had changed into women's clothes.
He stressed that he was “proud of work” and did not consider it to be propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he was frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case where "a man in a deep drink shot down a film set and said it wasn't true."
"Then there were a couple of times when we met disgruntled locals who didn't know what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who first came in complaining started helping us," he summarized.
The shooting incident, which explains the publication, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkariya, when a drunk man attacked a vehicle of a film crew carrying a gun, after which he was detained by the police.
It was previously reported that Olga Barantz, the Public Commissioner for the Protection of the Family, had filed a complaint with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor for the use of more.tv, which placed the Russian series Chiki.
The baran accused the producers of the series of "promoting non-traditional sexual relations and feminism", drawing attention to the fact that the film's main characters are working as prostitutes and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence".
The Ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that "the series pays a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of a minor character.
Chicky's comedy drama tells of three prostitutes who started a new life and started a business on the advice of a friend.
