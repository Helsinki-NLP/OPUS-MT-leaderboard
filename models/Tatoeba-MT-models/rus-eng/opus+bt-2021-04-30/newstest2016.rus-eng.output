The social map of a resident of Ivanova province is recognized as an electronic payment tool.
The changes provide for the maintenance of a travel benefit in public passenger transport.
Since 24 September, the arrangements for the preferential travel of citizens using the social map of the inhabitants of Ivanova province have been changed.
According to the press service of the Russian Government for the Ivanovsk region, the changes provide for the maintenance of a travel benefit in public passenger transport and bring the social-card reconciliation scheme in line with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 of the Federal Act on the National Payments System.
The social map of the inhabitants of Ivanov province is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions under which it is applied have changed.
Thus, the replenishment limit is no longer fixed on travel as before, but on money, with no more than 400 rubles in winter and no more than 800 rubles in summer for the current month.
From now on, social card holders on transport receipts will need to track the balance of money rather than the number of remaining trips.
The cost of a concession travel for citizens would be 1/2 of the carrier's fare.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule for the replenishment of the social map remains the same, from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new mode of travel on the social map will have a number of advantages.
For example, it is possible to keep a detailed record of the expenditure of money on a social map to the nearest extent possible.
In addition, it is possible to recover the monies credited but unspent.
Let us also add that the clearing scheme with the carriers becomes transparent, as half the cost of travel is now paid by the citizen, and the same amount reimburses the carrier the budget.
No commission will be charged when the money is placed on the map.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Highway and Transport Department of Ivanov province, reported that more than 33 million social map trips had taken place in the region in 2014 and nearly 25 million trips in 2015.
More than 470 million rubles are provided for in the regional budget for the provision of preferential travel for citizens using a social map.
As at 1 September, reimbursement for this purpose amounted to more than 312 million roubles.
At the time of the 911 call, the teacher will confess to the murder of a friend.
During the 911 call with almost no tremors, the university teacher Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that he needed staff to come to their home.
Lamb stressed that there was a dog in the house who was alive but probably upset, and said that the contacts of the family members of the deceased could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a note hand-wrapped on a white piece of linen paper: "I'm sorry, I wish I could get it back, I loved Amy, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to authorities signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who had conducted two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then travelled 300 miles to the university campus, where the police believe he shot up a respected history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, on the doorstep of his cabinet.
Delta State University Chief of Police Lynn Baford reported that university staff had learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that true 911 call shortly after.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the educational institution forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, the authorities were still trying to put Lamb's motivations into one picture.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to draw a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gauthier, where Prentiss died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal cases.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he expressed appreciation to the "pretty people" with whom he interacted in his teaching life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures on both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
A student who spoke well of Lamb, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb had told him at the end of the 2014–15 school year how he had struggled with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
He only taught two online courses this year.
Recent changes in university recruitment rules meant that the doctorate that Lamb had worked so hard to obtain would not guarantee him an automatic teaching position.
University president William Laforge reported that he had no knowledge of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "it is clear that Mr Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb can't answer anymore.
Police attacked Lamb's trail after his escape from campus as he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber recoil gun in the backyard of the house, one mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, reported to the coroner of Washington County, Metel Johnson.
His car with a working engine was still standing on the driveway.
Nestraz did not understand why Lamb came to this house, although according to Johnson she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his Ph.D. in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and fun man.
Carla Hayrston told me she was 15 and Lamb was 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends went to high school, and he was a great older guy who spent years trying to teach her how to play guitar.
In those years, he was successful with women.
All the girls were melting when he was around," says Hayrston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss must have been seeing each other for a while now.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gauthier in a brick house whose backside goes to the canal.
According to the police, there's nothing wrong with the dog.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Steen, reported that they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they had a daughter who was 19 years old.
"She's completely depressed," told O'Steen about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he didn't meet Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Steen told me his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schaffer, a bartender and a part-time entertainment coordinator at the dullly lit bar The Juliep Room in the suburbs of Gautier, said that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and lip harmonica for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was seen.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and made fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, held seminars for freshmen and specialized in Native American and colonial American history, told Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He attended the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of student brotherhood and student self-government.
On Delta State University campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university professors, staff, students and community members, participated in a candlelight memorial ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
It's recovery day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police's statement that Lamb's 911 call entered the service after Schmidt's murder, and that although Lamb spoke of Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that he will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as he did last year, with a toy and goods director for children promising that he will allow regular staff and temporary staff to work more hours.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and wholesale bases across the country, which is less than the 45,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would begin interviews with the applicants this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although a few months before the holidays, the purchase season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to have enough staff in the stores and to sell, ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of Back to the Future turned out to be a huge event for Michael J. Fox.
She was notable for personal reasons as well.
"We sat at the cinema and waited for the royal family to arrive, I noticed the place was free with me, and then it dawned on me that Princess Diana would sit next to me," he said in a trailer by the soon-to-be-release documentary Back in Time.
The movie begins, and it comes to my mind that I'm literally at a distance of my arm and in one fake yawn from dating Princess Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as directed by Robert Zemekis and executive producer Stephen Spielberg.
The film Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
"For me," Spielberg says, "this is undoubtedly the greatest movie about time travel ever made."
Back in time will be available on VOD, DVD and some cinemas in October.
The head of the United Nations states that there is no military solution in Syria.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states, in response to Russia's military support for Syria, that there is no “military solution” for the almost five-year conflict, and an increase in armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN Head once again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon stated at a press conference on Wednesday that he was planning a meeting with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that differences within the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had “made the situation impossible”.
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated in addressing the issue of Iran ' s nuclear programme and the Syrian crisis.
8 poll results that show Donald Trump isn't joking.
Some tried to label him as a provocateur.
Others turned away from him, taking it as a joke.
And some people want a scandal.
But as some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's high position in the polls, they failed (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls demonstrated Donald Trump's advantage in two-digit numbers, and some begin to ask seriously what this means for a real estate tycoon in terms of the chances of getting a nomination.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to nominate the Republican Party.
Experts point out that during this time in 2011, Rick Perry gave way to the gaining popularity of Herman Kane, none of whom won one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in the general election.
But external groups such as Jeb Bush's SuperCommittee of Political Activity, and the growth club's economic conservative group recognize Trump's relentless power and begin to pull out their dollars to overturn it.
Here are some numbers of polls that suggest that a real estate tycoon is not just an intermediate phase:
The sympathy ratings for Trump turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans were favourable to this real estate tycoon.
By mid-July, it was 40 per cent.
In early August, it was 52 per cent.
Six out of 10 Republicans now favour Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators will prevail in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week revealed that 60 percent of the Republicans there were positive for Trump.
Two thirds of the votes for the GOP would have set up Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said either they were "excited" or "satisfying" if Trump were to become a candidate.
Only two out of ten say they'd be "disappointed" if he were a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "excited" against 40 percent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
The next-highest thrill?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they'll be "unsatisfied" or "disappointed" if they favor Jeb Bush's establishment as a candidate.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temperament a problem.
While Trump is widely criticized for his boasting and insults, 52 percent of Republican-minded voters across the country think that the magnate has the right temperament to be president, as shown by the ABC News/Washington Post poll held on Monday.
The same figure appears at the country's first closed meeting in the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same person who may be the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think he's not the man who can be effective at the post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say his temperament is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
Republican voters get used to that idea.
When they wear their expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
When asked who was the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump was a favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of 10 were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the right magical crystal before.
At the same time in the last cycle of the cycle, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported possible candidate Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to rally around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some scholars point out that such a variation is likely to play into Trump's advantage, and at the same time, non-Trump's supporters are evenly distributed among supporting more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a one-to-one hypothetical competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
He outruns Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally, Randa Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He's got a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson beat a businessman to 19 points in a one-to-one hypothetical competition.
Just over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the voters supporting Trump say they are confident of their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change things, and no one can really say that he'll never change his mind.
Forty-six percent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump's most intense competition at the moment is with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rape" two months ago in his campaign opening speech, immigration has become the most relevant topic in the 2016 conversations.
Some are concerned that Trump's posturing will ward off key Latin American voters from the Republican Party and hinder rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll held on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration matters.
So as long as immigration attracts the attention of all, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on support from about half of Republican voters, mainly due to their outsider status.
Six of the 10 Republicans on Monday of the new ABC/Post poll state that they want a political outsider rather than a man with government experience.
And they're also mad at Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with Republican activities in Congress, with 54 per cent "unsatisfied" and 21 per cent "in anger."
The government will decide the fate of pension indexation in October.
RF Vice Prime Minister Olga Holdojec stated that the government is now looking for options to implement the pension indexing law in 2016 to a real level of inflation, transfers to the WG.
She noted that a solution should be found by 8 October, when the draft budget was submitted to the Government next year.
In addition, Kabmin is discussing the option of extending the decision to freeze the accumulated pension of Russians.
The well noted that the sum of pension savings is 350 billion rubles.
About the same amount is worth indexing pensions in full for the following year.
According to the Vice-Premier, there is no final decision as to who should pay the contributions for non-working citizens.
If a person does not work on his or her own initiative and does not belong to socially disadvantaged categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for it.
The media had previously reported that the cabmine was considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are eyelids often irritated and blushing?
Othalmologist Tatiana Levashova replies:
Our eyelids are screens protecting the eyeball from the many fine particles that settle on them.
By forgetting the regular cleanup of the century, we often contribute ourselves to the development of bluffing.
The exit is simple:
Don't triple your eyes with dirty hands, carry with you a special wet napkin for the age.
At least one or two times a day, clear the parts of the century of the harmful substances accumulated in them during the day.
Cleaning procedures should also be supplemented by warm compresses with weeds of medicinal herbs (sage, chamomiles), liquefying the thick secret of the salinity glands, and then massages of the edge of the century, which should be carried out by circular movements of the finger cushions;
When washing your makeup, do not use alcohol - containing devices.
They dry and dehydrate the skin, and contribute to the further thickening of the secret of the salt glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclearers created an atomic warhead.
North Korean authorities reported that the country's main nuclear reactor, the Yongbyon nuclear complex, was operating "at full capacity."
This was reported on the website of the country's Central Telegraph Agency.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to "the US aggression and nuclear threat" and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "in both quantity and quality".
The last test of nuclear weapons was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, no plans to resume the full operation of the reactor have been reported since then.
Pyongyang claims he succeeded in creating an atomic warhead.
The DPRK has also carried out tests of medium- and short-range missiles on several occasions, writing polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the reference to brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the reference to the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He stated this during the State Duma meeting, reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand," said Zhirinovsky.
The Deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the quadruples that contain this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky stated that the current anthem should be changed to "God Save the King", and the Russian tricolor should be replaced by an imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is convinced that if Europe is to deal with the refugee problem, it must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the root causes of the problem must be addressed.
If Europeans care about refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That's our opinion on the issue.
"That's the essence of the refugee question," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to achieve consensus.
However, if we want real success, it is impossible for people to die, for bloodshed to continue and for people to feel safe.
"So we can reach consensus, but we can't realize anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
Let us recall that about 500,000 migrants, including Syrian migrants, arrived in the European Union during this year.
The European Commission has stated that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that thousands of Islamic State extremist fighters may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to establish their cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
The people of the German city had a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become a refugee reception leader, although it has recently strengthened border controls to contain their influx.
The authorities estimate that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts cite significantly large numbers.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have already arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited Darmstadt, whose residents provide very warm receptions to migrants.
Jeremy Corbin debuts at the Prime Minister's questions session
After Mr. Corbin's election, his debut at the questions session is very much awaited by the Prime Minister.
The new Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbin will soon be speaking for the first time at the Prime Minister's question session, in a first-time effort with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will deliver the first of the six questions in the afternoon; his presentation is likely to be followed closely by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for "less theater and more facts" in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could skip some meetings, leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as leader; it will take place after he has appointed a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Tread Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silently during the performance of the national anthem on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, prompted criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several advanced newspaper articles.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention.
Mr. Corbin's spokesman stated that he "stands in respectful silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, a member of Mr. Corbin's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "independently" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbin's team, expressing differences on economic, defence and international politics, while fewer than one sixth of the members of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political disagreements will also "crowd a stack" in the Labour Party after Mr. Corbin's appointment to the European Union and the government's restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Tread Union Conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Shadow Minister of Labour and Pensions, stated that there was “full clarity” in the party that she was opposed only to the Government's plans to reduce the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth Labour leader to be met by David Cameron at the courier box in the last ten years since he became the Conservative Party leader.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, states that he has “reached collective resources” to gain ideas for Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Member of Parliament for the Eilington North District stated that the Prime Minister's questions caused unnecessary confrontation, and that he would refrain also from witty answers and exchange of stakes, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems faced by young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Economy in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him on matters of prime minister when he was absent - for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying that he had spoken to House Speaker Community John Berkow to discuss the matter.
As leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to leave the political style of the "Yarmar Baragana" often associated with the Prime Minister's question procedure, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, questions to the Prime Minister have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to govern the House of Commons, and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires extensive reforms.
"Closed in Yoburg" Homeless young people who learned to be photographers

Pound sterling rises as UK wages rise
The pound rose against a background of rising wages in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising due to the offer to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, UK earnings, minus bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate has been the highest since 2009, and has been met as an early postponement of projections for possible increases in quotations.
Pound sterling grew by more than 1% relative to the dollar to $1.5505, and 0.84% relative to the euro, making the J1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general, SABMiller's shares were highlighted, which increased by 20% due to a purchase offer from AB InBev's competitor.
The deal would bring together the two largest brewing companies in the world, collecting brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares grew by 0.9 per cent against the background of encouraging news from a competing group of luxury goods manufacturers.
The latest data on Richemont sales surpassed expectations and showed that sales in China - in the key market for Burberry - have begun to grow again.
Glencore shares increased by 5% after the mining giant claimed to have been able to earn $2.5 billion through equity, which was done as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's paper and packing group's shares were the top down in the index - 4.3 percent - after Goldman Sachs reduced the band's rating to "sell".
JD Sports shares grew after the sports clothing company reported an 83 per cent increase in pre-tax profits six months to £46.6 million.
JD Sports chief says higher wages can prevent expansion
JD Sports executive director Peter Caughill says raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But it is unlikely that such purchasing power will outweigh the increase in labour costs, he says.
The costs could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could have meant reducing the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a bottom-up campaign to fight Aldi's attack
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi attack in South Australia and Western Australia.
A bottom-up food wholesaler launched a campaign to protect the IGA market share in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the upcoming Aldi infusion of $700 million.
While Aldi prepares to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and West Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and promote the IGA brand through marketing in mainstream media and social media and at Adelaide Show events.
The campaign is joined by IGA's rhythmlers and suppliers, such as the ice cream manufacturer Simmo's from Dunsborough, who offers tasting at IGA stores, and store owners selling discounted tickets to regular customers at South Australian Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on 29 September, the day that this wholesale supplier of food, alcohol and household goods will observe its annual investor strategy day.
Much is at stake, as IGA brand stores in South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as adherents to traditional routes, so the market here is more favourable to IGA rhythmlers than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland states – more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA, compared with about 14 per cent in Eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of their first stores, taking sales from all players present, but mainly from independent rhythmlers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst for Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA rhythmlers may lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA the following year, with sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
The loss of revenues and sales of food at a high level of constant costs of Metcash may cost the company about 13 million income before interest and taxes are paid, Mr. Kirat considers.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in eastern states, mainly due to Aldi and Coles, and this is despite a recent study by Morgan Survey finding that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash food sales will drop by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglas's leading stock manager, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, observed attending a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "may be highly likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
But it is believed that a member of the board of directors of the Metcash company contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has declined since 2010 from 18 per cent to 14 per cent, and Metcash's food business revenues, which the company supplies to approximately 1,200 IGA rhythmlers, have fallen by 43 per cent compared to 2012 due to operational delegation and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not surrender, spending more than $150 million annually to equalize retail prices with those in Coles and Woolworths on thousands of items weekly, and helping IGA rhythmlers to remodel trading sites, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider choice of branded foods.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says that price equalization and remodelling of the trade area are gaining momentum, and hopes that the company will increase net profits in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanashi Kokkinakis is supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves honor, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanashi Kokkinakis was indirectly injured in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more honor than criticism for his behaviour, as Tennis Australia President Steve Healy says.
Kokkinakis, Jr. in a talented duo and often called Special Ks, was unwittingly the focus of attention due to Kiryos' shameful fight with Stan Warrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly thereafter, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnatti, the judges at the tower had to split Kokkinakis twice and his opponent Ryan Harrison, with Harrison stating, "Vavrinka had to be laid on Kiryos' blades, and I had to lay on this guy's blades."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racket after the convulsions in his leg saved Richard Gaske from possible defeat on US Open, Healy loyally defends Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second to Bernard Tomić in singles in the Davis Cup semi-finals against the UK.
"I'm very worried about one thing, namely that Tanashi was drawn into conflict," Healy said.
He did break the racket when he had a leg on US Open, but he wasn't the first player to break the racket when hopes collapsed, and I know Tanashi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good at dealing with quite provocative situations on US, Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he's trustworthy.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works a lot, he fits into the team well, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's intensely trained, he's in great shape, he's a very determined and advanced young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match starting on Friday, believing "side consent" the right way out for everyone, but hoping that a guy from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term player.
"Before everything, we want the team to focus entirely on the match, not on the controversy around [Kirios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick gained power very quickly, as people like Federer and Marray prove, he grows in front of the public, he has made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and it's necessary, I think, to get him out of the spotlight for a while so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
Having declared a state of emergency, Hungary had closed the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and detained those who were trying to enter the country illegally to contain the influx of migrants.
There had been unrest at the border, with hundreds of migrants gathering on the border, to which the Serbian authorities had reacted sharply.
Stuck indefinitely on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their home country broke up tents and settled in the area.
However, frustration has increased.
When they were surrounded by a police helicopter, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian Special Forces.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared the expulsion of migrants from Hungary “unacceptable” when more and more of them arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
There is a need for negotiations with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dačić in Prague.
The disturbances at the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after a block of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (in the following month or by the end of the year) that EU member States would accept an additional 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis affecting the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect prompt action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater authority to act on the crisis, allowing them to close the roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Siyarto, stated that his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence on the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had completed the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were involved in urgent work to complete a barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary has become the main “bottom” and crossing point of the EU border for the displaced, many of whom are refugees who have been victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
Nevertheless, Prime Minister Victor Orban insists that the majority of the people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life rather than refugees who are victims of war activities that are entitled to protection, a view that is sharply divided with those of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force in Hungary at midnight, now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison terms for those accused of human trafficking.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovač said to journalists in the southern town of Seged.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, Parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are at the border have been observing the presence of armed troops with vehicles and dogs there for several days now.
Diergy Bacondi, Orban's national security adviser, reported the capture by authorized authorities of 45 persons attempting to cross the border at the border itself and 15 others inside the country.
They have crossed the border by breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of having committed administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly rebuilding the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, forcing a railway wagon wrapped with barbed wire to block one of the passages.
Disorders broke out on the main passage across the border near the city of Ryoske, Hungary, as the Hungarians placed a service space to pass people inside a metal container, and crowds of people pushed each other to break inside.
Approximately 20 individuals were able to penetrate, with thousands of people remaining outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced a refusal to eat and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in the national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit advantage in the Democrat race for nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders catches her up.
Clinton now has support of 47 per cent among primary Democratic voters (down from 58 per cent), and Sanders goes second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to take part in the presidential race, is supported by 15 percent of the primary Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the contest in the primary election, most Democrat voters say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
Clinton’s supporters are more confident in their choices than those supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton holds a great advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has declined.
Her support among men has fallen substantially, and Sanders is only five points behind her.
Clinton's preference for Democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and he and Sanders are on an equal footing now.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton overtaken Sanders by a two-digit number among the liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Almost half of the primary Democrat voters across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support it only because she was a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It may not be surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who currently do not support Clinton, views are more controversial - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48 percent of the primary Democrat voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked openly why they want to be her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), then that now is the time of the female president (13 per cent), and that she is the best candidate for the position (10 per cent).
Clinton supporters also talk about an association linking it to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called an agreement on the issues and the chances of election.
Since the vice president is considering potential participation in the election, 57 percent of the primary Democrat voters would like him to join the race - although a third believe he should not.
When asked who they would like to see second among party candidates, the primary Democrat voters in most cases call Biden.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half say that they would have chosen Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to stand for the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the race participants to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of Democrat voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the general election; however, that figure fell from 78 per cent last month.
By this rate, Biden has a high second-place lag, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, answering the question of what is most important about the candidate, Democrat voters choose options other than the chances of being elected.
Similar to the situation last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democrat candidates, or potential candidates, have shown a good result on some key characteristics among their primary voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden of all three leads by honesty, and Clinton's strong side in her leadership qualities.
Thirty per cent of the primary Democratic voters do not consider Clinton fair and credible, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain view of it.
Primary Democrat voters also generally consider the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be similar.
By all these standards, about a quarter of Democrat voters have no opinion of Sanders.
While questions regarding the personal e-mail box and server at Hillary Clinton's household by her Secretary of State continue, most of the primary Democrat voters are satisfied with her explanation on this matter and believe that this has not adversely affected their general view of her.
But that's a different story for the American public as a whole.
Half the Americans today are dissatisfied with her explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided as early as March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the e-mail controversy has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say that their opinion of it has deteriorated.
Most of them are Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is regarded as a fair and credible voter by her party, it continues to be a challenge for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent consider her to be fair and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump, however, both get good marks on leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush show the best result in honesty.
Most see Sanders as more honest than no, but as Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary Democrat voters is 6 percentage points.
Based on a national poll, Ben Carson is close to Donald Trump.
Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump in the last CBS/New York Times poll.
The two candidates won half the vote in the new poll, leaving everyone else in search of a foothold.
Republican voters throughout the country continue to support Trump massively, whose support rate increased from 23% in a recent CBS poll held the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27% in a Tuesday poll.
But Carson took off from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also revealed that Carson enjoyed support in all population groups, replacing Trump in a Republican voter group with a higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, rolled back with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Hakaby, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio together ranked third with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this recent poll is plus or minus 6%, and the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson's growth in polls - showing 19 percent support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.
Due to Carson's increased support last week, Trump made several critical remarks against the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the fraternity are charged with the death of a freshman at Baruch College
About two years after the death of a college student during the dedication ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, a murder charge was brought against five people.
"P Delta Psi fraternity members from Baruch New York College brutally attacked Chan "Mickle" Deng during dedication ceremony in September 2013 and failed to bring him to hospital in time, resulting in his death," reported to police.
Officials say that a student with eyes tied and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times while he tried to reach the target, walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the P Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 when Deng passed out, and waited for an hour, presumably, before taking him to the hospital, they're talking to the police.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, to ask advice as police chief Chris Wagner told at a press conference.
"In this moment, the fraternity members began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the brotherhood above the health of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt head, torso and thigh injuries.
"Too many families have suffered as a result of dedication rituals to brotherhood, as at least one student dies during them every year, starting in 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in his statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County jury leaned in favour of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with assaulting a rookie and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to hold not only individual participants accountable, but, if there is an organization that has authorized all this formally or informally, so too,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity removed the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There'll be a rate hike, and the bull market will stumble, bond returns will grow, and the economy will collapse into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take to get there, and how long it will last.
Specifically for the economy, history explains little about time.
The recession occurred only 11 months after the first rate increase and for a full 86 months.
The toughness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, though not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
So the administration of the US Central Bank insists that investors should not focus on when they start raising rates, but on how much adaptation will take.
Indeed, there are many variables in the game.
After all, however, market participants may find that all the fuss around the rate increases is exaggerated.
"The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the cheap money era," said Julian Jessop, chief international economics specialist at Capital Economics, in his client commentary.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to more normal, but still low levels will be the seismic momentum that many fear.
That does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a view of how some areas of the economy could respond according to historical trends:
As the market has seen in the past month or so, the expectation of an increase in rates could lead to volatility for some time.
When the rate rises, however, the consequences are usually less dramatic.
"It doesn't look like stock revenue slowed 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of Federal Reserve rate increases.
More specifically, the market is more likely to change sharply over the past 35 years or so - about 14 per cent - towards higher rates, remains fairly stable within 250 days of this (average growth 2.6 per cent), then returns to normal after 500 days with an average return of 14.4 per cent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, Chief Stock Trade Strategy Specialist at Nuveen Asset Management, published at Baron's.
Deutsche says that the outcome for securities tends not to become immediately more pronounced at the rate rise stage, and equity returns begin to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they are often aided by higher rates.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that were not previously available and that could accelerate the recession.
Most of the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point in the history of the high rate.
Deutsche Bank claims that in 118 cases the rate increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it will last long, with it remaining at only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates on such a volatile economic background can be risky and raises the question of whether this time will be different, as reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to raise Federal Reserve rates throughout the year, with their view tied to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
So far, many policy experts and economists believe that FOMC could approve a rate increase at this meeting, futures trade is only 25 percent likely.
"In our study since 1950, all the cycles of rate hikes to date have been in a super cycle of increasing financial leverage with GDP overlapping peaks precipitating recession very quickly after recovery," says the report.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is now the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, a total of 74 months and is not yet over.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market expects higher rates, and this scenario is in some ways similar to the one being sold for shares.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect will come faster than for equity when the Federal System changes strategic direction.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the return changes the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate increase cycle, the bond return falls immediately," reports Deutsche.
Strategy experts from Charles Schwab believe that higher rates will result in long- and short-term bond returns coming together, making the curve more flat.
High-return bonds often behave better in such a climate, although "we are still afraid of fluctuations in returns," says a study by Katie Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected policy results of the Federal System.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are signs that the market has been engineered to the prospect of a tougher monetary policy," she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is more flat, credit spreads have increased, volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Federal System policies are tightened.
Generally speaking, companies that run their major businesses in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with many debts would be in a worse position, as the growing dollar made their products more expensive in the world market space and their debt more expensive in the financial area.
"The story shows that "quality" shares show performance above market within three months of the initial rate rise," said Goldman Sachs analysts in the client report.
Firms with stable financial conditions bypassed companies with unstable conditions in each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility shares have also shown better performance than low-quality shares by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (interest points) respectively.
Duty will be a big question.
Companies with high debt interest with floating rate will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts differ as to how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 - copy Classic FM," claims Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for "lower standards"
Proves she's getting less different from a commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the award was simply torn off with Brits.
A colleague in Parliament, Damien Collins, who hit The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM," the MP leader said, encouraging the radio company to prove that it was doing something that commercial companies did not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also stated to BBC management that it seemed that the public radio station was "stupid" and was becoming increasingly less distinguishable from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like using the word "simplification" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two examples that came to me first, where you're actually just copying what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC CEO rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is going far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his loyalty to live performances and the creation of music will not really compare to anyone else.
"It's also really important, I think, Radio 3's interest in finding new music and promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey argued that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC child to be attacked for stepping on the heels of commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Member of Parliament for Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a talent music show that the BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million price.
See why this program is often discussed because of a lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in the "typical BBC style".
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit in its own stable" the next time she starts a entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to discourage ordering new seasons of The Voice in the future or using money from those paying licence fees for other entertaining formats.
Internet sales went down as slow as possible in August, and black Friday could be the fault.
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7 per cent increase in online sales
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago with mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that November Black Friday could help contain waste
For about ten years, virtual shopping has experienced a boom, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost towns.
But experts say that there are now signs of levelling online sales, after recent data showed only a seven percent increase during the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping expenditures in August have shown minimal growth since they began to be recorded in 2000, increasing by only 5 per cent.
Experts say that there are now signs of levelling online sales after the latest figures show only a seven per cent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and get back by 2000, they always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Mulcahey, IMRG sales index editor.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, such as sitting on a couch.
But now it's coming out on the plateau, and you can see the decline (growth).
The Phenomene of Black Friday, who came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for slowing sales.
Experts believe that buyers might have refrained from buying before the event that took place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers, five times the average, rushed to computers to take advantage of favourable offers, thus destroying a number of sellers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers engage in a real fight for lucrative purchases, might have forced people to refrain from shopping.
According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, just over £1 out of every 5 is spent online.
For products such as television and washing machines, more than one third are sold through Internet stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more readily than in fashion stores on central streets.
Muslims bury those killed in the crash of a crane in Mecca, and sanctions have been imposed on bin Laden's family
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead across the streets as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed Saudi Binladin Group's construction giant for the accident.
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also injured after the collapse of the crane
Hundreds of Muslims flocked from all over the streets to bury 29 of the victims who had died as a result of the collapse of the crane at the main Mecca mosque.
Dressed mainly in white, those present at the funeral flooded the carriageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad procession passed by a sacred site where just a few days earlier a construction crane had pierced the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were issued for burial, and at the same time King Saudis fined a construction company belonging to the bin Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 parishioners killed in the collapse of a crane at the Main Mosque were carried on the streets
Among the dead were Qasim Akram, the father of four children from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the arrow of the crane raised with a non-functioning crane.
The Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press State Agency, states that Binladin Group bears partial responsibility for the collapse.
The English editorial of the news agency did not provide this detail, but reported that company leaders were banned from travelling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the cause of the crane's fall into the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the crash of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inappropriate coordination with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the extensive construction work that Binladin Group is conducting.
The bin Laden family has been one of Saudi Arabia's closest ruling families for decades and has run the largest construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a cheating son whose family had renounced in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in life for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about 174,000 pounds) to the relatives of the deceased, and the same amount was irreversibly injured.
The remaining victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q claims that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European craftsmen working for little money
According to Veronica Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair workers.
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
Result - more than 200 new Screwfix stores opened for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores throughout the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Principal City Correspondent Daily Mail
They say the British put away hammers and paint brushes, and instead hire qualified Easterners to do work in the house.
If you can handle a hammer or paint walls with skill, you seem to be outnumbered these days.
Because, according to the owner company B&Q, the British still tend to hire specialist masters to do easy housework.
Veronica Laurie, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a network of house-building services, reported that behind this trend is a substantial influx of skilled masters from Eastern Europe offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in goods for masters, and at the same time close 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Laurie said that she would like to see more women in B&Q shop staff, as eight out of ten decisions on shop purchases were made by women of weak sex.
At present, the majority of staff are men.
She also said that recent demographic trends, characterized by an increase in the number of households made up of single women who were more involved in the development of their homes than in the past, could not be overlooked.
Ms. Laurie said, "It's still mostly men who work in our shops.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on goods purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Laurie, one of the five women in charge of leading British companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team, achieving equal numbers of men and women directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50% of managers are women, including the CEO and finance director.
Ms. Laurie said, "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding suitable women on the board was easy.
After the group took over the cost of closing the stores, Kingfisher showed a six-month decline in profits and sales.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, who owns the Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decision time
The world is watching a meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, where two days debate the most important decision to make is whether or not to raise an interest rate for the first time in a decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters revealed that just over half of those who thought that the Federal Reserve would do so last week are now expected to delay and maintain the rate at the current range of 0-025 per cent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach the fact that the main bank can move from zero to start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a leading official of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The US economy works well, the economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore the impact of the decision on the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should prepare for change, but all of them were convinced that all chances were against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday.
New Balkan Route: Refugees go to the EU via Croatia.
"Open up!" hundreds of refugees chant at the Horgos crossing point on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for the settlers.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to explore other routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
The other, through Croatia and Slovenia, to Austria.
According to some reports, buses carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading towards the city of Shida on the Croatian border.
Drivers were instructed by the authorities to proceed without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojša Stepanović assures that his country is doing its utmost to help the refugees, but her capacity is limited:
Our job is to keep Serbia as safe as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to be treated humanely.
But this is already a pan-European problem.
It is difficult to solve, and no country in Europe alone can handle it, much less a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade asks Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Premier Victor Orban is relentless:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia they must complete the necessary documents.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed into our country, because Serbia is quite safe.
Hungary has already built a 175-tyclometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop: he plans to build the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Meimarakis has been part of the center-right governments for a number of years, leading, in the view of the left, to a financial crisis.
Now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, he challenges Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist, Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for inviting me.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by giving in to the SIRISA coalition, but now, according to polls, the New Democracy has come to terms with it by popularity.
What changed in that time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and growth prospects.
The country is now again facing fiscal deficits and high unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises made by Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what they promised to what really happened.
Day-to-day life had become markedly worse than in January, when the situation had improved, with the majority of Greek citizens affected.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SIRIZ.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The thing is, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that, in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in place, political forces and all ruling parties have come together to implement a programme on which they have agreed without abandoning their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of an agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become a new premier on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece's movement along the European path, because we have a good idea of the devastating consequences that a country's withdrawal from the EU would have had.
Europe now helps us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, Junker's package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would be lost if there was no treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures were the result of Mr. Tsipras' negotiation.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government, in its first year in power, wants to establish order, acts rationally, and makes it clear that the country has strong political will to implement a rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of what leads to recession can be renegotiated, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to assume that, in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they await full implementation of the agreement.
If we are to regain their trust, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural change, which have been agreed upon, while continuing to take advantage of EU financing and the great investment opportunities that we must open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Tsipras did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, as we have learned from our discussions with our European colleagues.
I can give an example of this with regard to farmers' income.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the ministers of Tsipras had never talked about it.
I mean, Greek ministers were unprepared and poorly informed, so they failed to negotiate and conclude a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon find yourself at the same table with Mr. Junker, Holland, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Would what you say to them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we tried best to implement the 2012 agreement by bypassing its sharp corners.
We have moved the reforms forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in emergency situations.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price of the Greek government.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that made up the government majority at the time.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a functioning parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would have continued to improve had the process not been interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: There has been a massive influx of refugees throughout Greece in recent weeks.
What do you think of this situation, and of the reaction of the European countries that these people are seeking?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we have to deal with after we win the election.
And the reason is that SIRIZA's government didn't act in the right way in this situation.
In such matters, we should be proactive, because if the problem strikes you, only emergency measures remain.
And that's the situation we're in now.
Even the interim government that replaced SIRIZ did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions by the interim Government, which has received valuable assistance from the President of the Republic, who has called for an EU summit, will lead to a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and notice that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some sort of emergency that happened to them.
There is a profound humanitarian dimension to this issue, and we will adhere to the position that European politicians must adopt in this new situation.
The decision must be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations must be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance received from the EU in order to be able to deal with this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzkovka, Donetsk Oblast, during the course of 24 hours, criminal investigation officers of the Regional Police Headquarters, together with military counter-intelligence, identified and detained a suspect who had been found to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Kriva Rog (Dnepropetrovsk Oblast), who had fired a machine gun at his opponent the previous night during the joint consumption of alcohol, and the ensuing conflict in the village of Hautetorek Yasinovatsky, Donetchina.
A 22-year-old boy was reported injured from a hospital where he was hospitalized with passing gunshot wounds to his legs.
According to Artem Vasitsky, deputy head of the Criminal Investigation Department of the police head of the province, during the course of the operational actions, the law enforcement officers proved the subject's involvement in another serious criminal offence, the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operatives found that on the same day, there was a conflict between the suspect and another local resident, resulting in a fatal gunshot wound to the head of the man.
Criminal proceedings under the articles “Intentional murder” and “Intentional infliction of serious bodily harm” of the Criminal Code have been opened by the Investigation Division of the Druzkovsky Department of the Ministry of Justice.
The detainee faces up to 15 years' imprisonment.
Figurant was detained and placed in a temporary detention facility, and reported to the Donetsk Oblast Police Press Service.
Two residents of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in Ukrainian flag colours, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, were sentenced by the Russian court to imprisonment.
Two other residents of the city were sentenced to restriction of liberty.
The inmates of Novosibirsk were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicts received 14 and 18 months ' restriction of liberty.
The Lenin Court of Novosibirsk found four citizens guilty of vandalism against Lenin's monuments, which were located on the premises of the CPRF Committee and on Trickotage Street, as well as the Monument Slava Memorial Complex.
In the latter case, the Katyusha missile installation and the T-34 tank were painted.
Let us recall that on the night of 12 December in Russian Novosibirsk, unknown men painted military equipment in the colours of the Ukrainian flag on the Monument of Slava.
The civil wife of a popular Russian actor, Evgeny Gyganov, Irina Leonov, gave birth to a seventh child.
The girl came to life at one of Moscow's clinics.
Newborn and her mother feel good.
Let's remind you, the Gypsies and Leonov broke up recently.
Eugenius refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambition for everything.
Eugenia Roma are 36 years old.
He is an actor at the Master Petra Fomenko Theatre in Moscow.
He is known for the films Walk, Cosmos as a Premonition, Brestic Fortress, Othepel and Farza.
On September 8, Evgeny Romanov was recognized as "Acter of the Year" and "Man of the Year" by the Russian version of popular GQ magazine.
The man who opened the shooting at Delta State University left an apology note.
After shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he was "sympathetic" about the first murder and that he wanted "everything back," was reported by the authorities on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, report that a teacher of geography and social sciences at Delta State University called 911 at around 10:00 in the morning.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and also mentioned that there's a dog in the house that won't hurt anyone, but probably upset.
The police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't call it.
Lamb didn't explain why he fired the gun.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm sorry I'd like to get it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
Writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday night, when he was surrounded by police, killed himself.
University Rector William Laforge reported that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr Lamb obviously had something on his mind."
Despite information received on Monday that Lamb was suggesting a novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday that there was “no information or evidence” of the “love triangle”.
Oh Prentiss referred to as "good man" by Sean O'Steen, who reported being married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and that she was "inconsolable."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, who San Herald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles told me that Prentiss had a hunting dog called Lightning, and that she dated Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his relatives on Monday at some point to say that "he's not going to jail."
On the evening of the same day the police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university website, Lamb received a PhD in pedagogy from Delta State University in spring 2015.
Stars Lost Their Luck
The actor (left), in a photograph with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term life companion Farru Fosett, who died of cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this has certainly played its part.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United dropped out for a few months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Champions League match in which Manchester United lost PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about this, which will prevent him from entering the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless push in the 15th minute, when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He's got a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be taken to Manchester tomorrow or the day later and then operated on.
It's terrible that a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, went through a lot of trouble and started playing fantastically, and that's when it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll be six months, and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and there was no penalty.
The Arbitrator Nikola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge yourself when I say it's worth the penalty and the red card.
It was a very bad two-foot ride.
In her tweet, Shaw says, "Thanks to everyone for your messages, in words, not to describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I'll be back even more powerful than I was."
Also on the subject: Manchester United experiences a disaster with Luke Shaw in a game with PSV
The British defender will have an additional incentive to recover from the European Championships in France next June.
Phillip Koku, a PSV coach, said, "It's a very severe injury."
When any player leaves with a similar injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the enemy.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gali at the 2014 World Championships.
"He's having a really hard time right now because he had no intention of hurting his opponent, and when you hear that it's a very severe injury, he's not feeling well," Koka said.
I couldn't see the moment itself.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in a different direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched it, but I didn't see a ride under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to handle it.
I'm very hard, and I'm very sorry.
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Loreks?
One thing every parent learns very quickly is that if your child likes a book, it will take a little while before you get to know it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
In response to a question from a representative of a holiday organization about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Lorex, an environmental tale written by Dr. Suze in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a commentary published on SuperCamps' website, and goes on to say, "This is a fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children because it always reveals some image or message we miss."
And everything would be all right, except for the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to recount the contents of the book, but actually tells the story of the film of the same name, made in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify a rather short original narrative.
"In the high walls of the city of Nesnuzhville, where there was no green and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart, the girls of her dream, fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," we read in the text a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Suzu (real name Theodore Suze Geisel), who died in 1991.
If it doesn't look suspicious enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a summary of the story of the film Lorex posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high-walled city of Nesnuzhville, where everything was artificial and even air sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win Audrey's heart, the girls of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, who is admittedly an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about how a greedy tree-cuter and a "all-the-world" knitter, Nakhodkins, destroys the environment despite Loraks' protests (whose name is in the book's name), a funny creature with mustaches who "talks on behalf of trees."
It is likely that such a simple PR task was assigned to a performer who never read a child's book about Loraks 20 times in a row.
A representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly received from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments followed.
There was clearly a risk for Adam Lith not to be in England, but it's still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England selected for this tour, the repetition of the 3-0 test series that happened last time does not seem likely to me.
I wouldn't rule out winning in my field either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but it has players among batters who virtuoso take roll balls, and collective thinking is strong; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only youthful positive.
With the ball, Moin Ali turns into a bowler pitching the rolls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Also on the subject: Adam Lit dropped out of England's test cricket team and was replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to exclude Adam Lit, my head coach at Yorkshire, is certainly difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality is that cricket players are judged by the judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I've said it before) players choose themselves best.
A couple half-sotenes, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in the power of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there'll be another opportunity.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, spoke well of his attitude, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team player first, and then everything else.
The question of how long it's gonna take before the test cricket batsman gets impressed is a tough question.
Lit played seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton at nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his or her own field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Lit was in the best shape, but this lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's a batsman I appreciate.
He's an unpredictable cricketer, which we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season, when he earned 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was something already.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those before him, but it would certainly depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would allow for the introduction of an additional spinner, keeping four speed bowlers, is being considered, and I am not opposed to it at all.
I don't see why a punching player can't hit a ball there, and that left-handed girl already showed that he's a hell of a cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what it takes for his county of Woostershire, but it's the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 third batsman test matches before appearing as the opening in 2001.
He won three hundred right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup spinner, and when I spoke to him briefly, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People can look at his sample statistics -- an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky bet, but among the spinners voting in favor, a little bit, and the pickers chose youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayaurendin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a workshop move.
He's one of the best guys for the game to bring to it the wealth of experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and a merciless pace in the setup.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, be it a game or a coaching job, and, like Mahela, has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has already been said, can give the team new strength.
Colley's teammate Durham's Ben Stokes is left for one day, Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, the coaches and the players' selectors do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy.
The UK’s exit camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's ill-conceived policy of reopening negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is increasingly difficult every day, even without looking back on the election of genius Jeremy-"Is that yes or no?"- Corbin as Labour leader or TUC's resentment about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that, in the current situation of the EU, a diverse crisis, not all of which were of its own making, some of the participating countries were fed up with the British egocentric agenda of divisive concessions and undermining agreements that they largely did not want.
Having met in Brighton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that he did not want them anyway if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "selfie Dave and George's program."
The Premier and the Minister of Finance ride through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the background of a famous local monument, with or without a local celebrity company, then come home and say they attract allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend who wants Britain interested in maintaining external contacts under the EU's tenet - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - proposes that overseas ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation deteriorates for her, as she has deteriorated for those who have stayed in her seat, Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14 years) and Kolya (16 years).
French head François Hollande stands before re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing his power, too.
Poland may soon receive a right-wing nationalist government, Spain on the left.
It's hard to see them climbing out of the skin to help the Selfi-British, whose energy could be wasted on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK – which they too do not want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue deliberately useless SNP-style remarcates during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to boost Britain's withdrawal from the EU, my friend suggests.
"Review was an idea-fix" and "British has received nothing valuable from renewed negotiations".
Europeans on their trouble know what a predator the Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical media magnates are about the EU, as opposed to Tony Ben's 1975 referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 with a 2–1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a hard-core Euro-opportunist famous for his "direct EU bananas" by the Brussels correspondent in the early '90s.
In all his folly, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a plentiful company of tax-afraid fraudsters, foreign phone hackers and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had exactly the same opinion of them, but he was aware that when you were in a cage with a violent gorilla, you had to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was a greater Blairist than Blair himself in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair had fallen in favour of the repealed EU Constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who had given him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him any of this.
But a mile of Jeremy Corbin, who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday-- I told him he didn't have time to waste it on me anymore-- looks like he's risking repeating Neil Kinnock's 'buffet Merdock' strategy from the '80s-- a mistake both then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a consistent press strategy -- not with me, but definitely with Andrew Marr, whose Air Force couch he was sitting on on Sunday.
Corbin's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist trend of Ukip and the wider group of "small England outsiders" among the Tories may say yes to that.
It's the same thing that Hilary-"Benn, but not Bennith"-Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner Boy Scout refusing to acknowledge with all his energy that Corbin's appointment of obnoxious John McDonnell as "black" finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father fought hard on TV for being disloyal to colleagues in the Labour Cabinet without going too far and losing his office in the Cabinet.
Hilary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay "under any circumstances" - Benn's phrase - is not what McDonnell said, and not what J.C. told the peers and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night, in general opinion.
Whatever the Democratic and "his boyfriend" Corbin wants to say-- remember, he touched even me-- the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in the whirlwind of social media, the hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It's wise not to let Cameron get away from Europe so easily, allowing him to accept as a proper support for Labour during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbin's basic misconception about EU membership – within the “bennit” economy of the besieged fortress – is no longer a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism generated by minor distinctions is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about Nato - Tom Watson - unshakeable that J.C. would not campaign for an exit - foreign diplomats would be obliged to try to communicate this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on Britain's concessions when it might be meaningless?
The US is already very disappointed by the British’s weak military actions in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even though the Tori government is cutting costs, as I was reminded on Monday during lunch at some forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from Public Health England
Government-funded agency claims that e-cigarettes are 95 per cent less harmful than smoking were heard at the meeting by 12 people, some of whom are related to the tobacco industry, researchers reported.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their e-cigarette report.
The PE published an important report, a "turn milestone" last month, calling it a "full review of evidence."
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the link between some experts and the tobacco industry.
In an editorial in Lancet's medical journal last month, they criticized the "extremely shaky argument" on which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers asked whether these statements had “hard or suspense reasons”.
Martin McKee, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: "The fundamental principle of health care - rules must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
According to them, the public expects PHE's statements that "the current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco smoking" to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this comes from the only meeting of the 12 people gathered to develop a model for multi-criterial analysis of decision-making in order to synthesize their views on the harm associated with the various nitino-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the meeting sponsors was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also confirmed BAT health certificates in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding he had reportedly previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the selection of board members was not provided, but there are several well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also claimed to finance the industry in the publication.
It is not known if the other participants in the meeting have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also visited by the tobacco director at PE.
The scientific article published by the group "finely agrees" that there is a lack of "permanent evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links and restrictions were affected in the PE report.
McKee and Capewell told us that PHE's statements that "there is currently no proof that electronic cigarettes are expensive, bringing children or non-smoking children" are premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Well-being at the PHE, said that the BMJ statements had previously been answered.
He said, "Electron cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco".
One of the two smokers died of his addiction all his life.
All evidence suggests that threats to health from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what is proven and what is not proven by this evidence, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people die a year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
Clearly, while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only do part of the harm caused by smoking, we do our job for the nation.
Former head of Channel 4 believes BBC should stop the EastEnders series
Former Chapter 4 head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that the BBC should stop releasing programs like EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would pay a lot for such successful shows as the soap opera about "The Mother of Albert".
Johnson observed that licensing fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other British television and radio companies.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service broadcasts, which are probably only a small part of the audience watching, at peak airtime when competitors have a high-profile show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson observed that he had unsuccessfully tried to collaborate with the BBC for six years while working at Channel 4.
"I can't get away from the idea that the BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting broadcasts that could be shown by competing non-subsidized companies," Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of an inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you keep the license fee, which I don't think is a good medium- and long-term solution, then the company should leave on the air only those programs that are not produced and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice show airs in prime slot because the creators want the best possible support for the future.
The idea of no one else showing it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to fund transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is generally known that they are their own production.
Other channels would certainly pay a lot for it.
I don't understand how this could be public broadcasting.
I don't think it would have humiliated the BBC in any way.
Serial businessman Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing ratings "because of staff ambition and their belief that this is the best way to get support for a long time."
His comments on the most popular BBC shows echo comments from Sky Executive Director Tony Ball, who, in his McTaggart Memorial Lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, invited BBC to sell EastEnders-type series.
Johnson observed that the more niche BBC public broadcast "continues to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audience, but the company's function is fulfilled, and this can be presented as an argument in the sanctimonious sermons justifying the proceeds of the £4 billion licensing fees: "Well, yes, of course, we do all these obscure broadcasts that no one is watching."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee the following: "I encourage you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the most from it.
Of course, you all think we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot of money, I wonder if they think so because they don't really watch and listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein, who also appeared before the committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should reconsider Rita's mission in favor of "information, education and entertainment".
He noted that only a small portion of BBC's output was now formally classified as educational - he said it was 1% of television content and 0.1% on radio - and that the company should capture the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "information, education and entertainment".
On partnership issues, Elstein observed that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as Promenade Concerts (only some of them, he said, are shown on TV), as well as enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
Sonogenetics allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves.
The video shows the nematodes changing direction as they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have brought out worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled using sonic waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction as they are influenced by sound impulses too high to be heard by the human ear.
Impulse effects by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Also on the subject: Researchers control brain activity with light
Scientists have said that worms demonstrate the possibilities of a new technique called "sonogenetics", which consists of using ultrasound to excite certain brain, heart and muscle cells, with the source of ultrasound located outside the body.
Sricant Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute, La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used in Parkinson's disease treatment.
The nematode worms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they started reacting when they were placed in liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
Strengthened ultrasonic waves affect structures called "TRP-4 ion channels" found in membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves force these ion channels to open and stir up the cells that are associated with them, as reported in Nature Communications.
To create a nematode that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications of worms, so their propulsion neurons used the ion channels TRP-4.
During the application of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were reinforced by microscopic bubbles and injected into worm organisms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in "optogenetics", a new direction that allows scientists to switch on and off neurons with light pulses.
Chalasani argues that there may be some advantages to this method of sonogenetics.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the right section of the brain through the fiber-optics, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass freely through the body's tissues, so you don't have to go inside the skull box to deliver them.
"We believe that to treat some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses can temporarily make human neurons sensitive to ultrasonic signals," said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements mock the British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International's video protesting the armament exhibit.
Amazing killer drones!
Ruining leg iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise batons that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The silent voice and drawing animation leave no doubt that this advert of the largest international arms exhibition is a merciless parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government's intention to push weapons to repressive regimes, taking advantage of the ExCeL's Doclands exhibition of defence technologies and security systems.

But a special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and on subway trains, which demand to see them again.
"An important announcement on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them in London Metro fonts depicting the DLR line turning into a tank silhouette.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will hit the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the arms show.
300 posters are painted by artists who posted their work at the Museum of Cruel Design at Banksy's Dismaland Park.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread them around London using a "post breaker kit", a 6-pound set of wrench keys that is said to "provide access to about a third of the advertising space at the planet's bus stops."
London transporters aren't happy with this "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody ads released by Special Patrol.
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and teacher at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and seeking to bring political art to the audience outside the galleries.
Many artists begin to work with protest movement activists, realizing that they have to go to the real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the arms exhibition, welcoming passengers to the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed over 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by VCCP working pro bono with a graphic designer and voice artist also working free of charge.
VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, was struck by the publicity silence around the arms exhibition - with an ExCel calendar pass - and thought, "Let's get them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create more realistic and cunning corporate advertising, but "filling her houses with bright flowers and animation turned out to be a more exciting occupation."
"They have incredibly helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
Now we need the British government to take action and guarantee that this torture equipment will not be sold illegally at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of the arms exhibition goes from within ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphemistically eufemenic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed information about an order for "AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting" from the U.S. Army.
It includes "an unparalleled cumulative warfare charge that brings an unparalleled sbron effect inside the target".

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Hostels
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the strained smiles of those I annoyed - and numerous, long complaints against others.
Most of the things I've learned can be arranged by eight simple rules.
Moving to a dormitory can range from a slightly nerve-driven to a totally frightening one.
He encourages you to talk, telling people where you came from, whether you took an academic vacation and where you spent it, whether you support Corbin, and why you "honestly, neither love, nor hate "Marmite" because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast hahaha extract, I'll be there."
Take a break.
And help others take a break, ask questions and show interest.
It keeps you talking and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't even talk to, even if you had eyelashes and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into drinking facilities, midnight movie halls, and party places, but they are also the place where people dress and fix underwear.
Also on the subject: Don't even think about starting university while in a relationship
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room must be a sanctuary, but many dormitories form a culture of twirling from one room to another, which fosters friendship, communication, and long friendship.
It could be hell for someone who's trying to restore power.
Nothing in culture lets you say, "I like you, and I want to keep being friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I can restore the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of communicating and not knocking on him, but sending a text message.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
One guy in my dorm was following the principle that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
Make friends with pastries.
As you start university life at the peak of the popularity of the Wake-Off show, knocking on people's door to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate cookies is no longer such a strange action, not so much like the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I made you something, and now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to be friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to chat with you, and eventually your face will probably be associated with their pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Badly-tempered lumps of flour, sugar, and fat would rather make people pretend to sleep when you knock on them.
Stealing food is a typical crime in student dorms.
Of course, stealing someone's chicken is theft, but is stealing a little milk for tea?
You can handle the milk owner.
He's probably gonna ask you to feel free, even if it's boiling inside of you.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you-- but try to treat it more adultly than my neighbor, who poured dishwasher fluid into her milk to avenge those who took it without asking.
She's in jail right now.
You don't have to make noises that will keep people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you're the same people from the glass houses saying.
The girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to lower the sound of the drum and bass guitar because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam this morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5 a.m., she graciously let him sleep for two hours, and then turned on her music and locked the door behind her, going to a three-hour exam.
Wasn't it romantic if your future husband settled in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, would it not be extraordinary, before biting elbows, clumsy, if you took your neighbor for your future spouse, became attracted to him, broke off the relationship, and should see him every day, and perhaps watch him pull to his side all your mutual friends?
Of course, you can't tell your heart, but if the hot neighbor isn't exactly your future husband, try to cool your own fire a little bit.
At this exciting moment, when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between prank and harassment is thinner than it looks.
A good prank is fun, but it turns into its opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never pack someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone else's door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you'll then put in the freezer - but don't tape other people's stuff to the ceiling more than two times.
iOS 9: How to install a new operating system on the iPhone after an update from Apple is released
You can request a new operating system by entering the Settings application to select General and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to download it and install it.
Some faced problems after installation when an error message appears telling them that "No application update failed".
To avoid this, users are encouraged either to wait until the reactivation has subsided or to try to update through iTunes.
The clues on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process.
The process may include removing applications to increase space - but Apple minimized the likelihood of the action by reducing the size of the update, and also simplified the execution with a special utilitaire that proposes to delete applications and re-establish them after the process has been completed.
You can make sure that your phone is charged or next to the charger to prevent the battery from being discharged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update as the discharge of the phone during the process could cause the update to fail.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity with a telephone call.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only exacerbates the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about this with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russian military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad poses the risk of exacerbating and prolonging the conflict and also has a negative impact on our common goal of combating extremism - unless we also continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through direct transfer of power," said the US State Department.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the US commitment to fighting the Islamic State in a coalition from more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member.
In addition, the US "will welcome Russia's constructive role in trying to confront the Islamic State".
Last Friday, representatives of the White House said that they did not know exactly what the Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the matter with Moscow.
However, White House spokesperson Josh Ernest noted that the time for a telephone conversation between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet arrived: "When the president decides that a telephone conversation with President Putin would be in our interest, then he would pick up the phone and try to make that call."
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime to be a "lost bet."
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake, that Assad's continued support would only make things worse.
"But he did not heed my warnings - and as a result, the situation deteriorated," said the President of the United States.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to grant temporary exemption to imported yachts and other floating equipment for recreation and sports from payment of customs duties and taxes.
Relevant changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported to the News by Elena Lashkin, Assistant Minister for Economic Development.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, following a visit to Crimea, instructed a number of agencies - the Ministry of Eco-Development, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation - to prepare proposals for the creation of favourable conditions for yachting in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - about €200 million are spent each year in the treasury of European States for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on the amendment of the list of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes, providing for full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating equipment for rest and sports.
According to the Ministry, this would certainly contribute to the creation of an enabling environment for the development of yachting in the coastal areas of the country, Laškina noted.
The matter was brought to the attention of the Subcommission on Customs and Tariff Regulation, Non-tariff Protection Measures in Foreign Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also endorsed by the authorities as a result of the discussion.
As the representative of Mineconomy noted, the proposed measure of full conditional release on entry was inherently a benefit.
Therefore, after the adoption of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will make a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member States of the EEA, Lashkin explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to facilitate foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for use in science, culture, cinema, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc. These include service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), measuring instruments, drilling equipment, stage suits and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skiing, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and religious observances.
In the Ministry's press service, Newsam reported that they had drafted binding regulations on the seaports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Theodosia and Evpatoria, which provided for simplified procedures for the entry and exit of small-scale, sporting sailing and recreational vessels to the seaport.
The Ministry has instructed the captains of the seaports of Crimea to ensure a simplified procedure for the entry of small-scale, sporting sailing and pleasure craft into the seaport and the departure of the listed vessels from the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared draft regulations of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the boundaries of the seaports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Theodosia, orders had already been issued, and the others were in the process of being agreed upon, as noted in the press service of the agency.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol are required to conduct State surveillance, classification and inspection, and State registration of small-scale vessels used for non-commercial purposes.
The problem is that in Russia it is the poor infrastructure that makes yachting very difficult.
If you look at southern Italy and France, it's a whole constantly developing industry that involves a lot of people.
In Russia, however, everything is actually in place.
Our coast is of little interest, the only piece where yachts can be operated all year round is the Black Sea in the Sochi, Gelenjik, Novoroskie, Anapa area.
But the big difficulty is that in this area, the very strict rules of the border service are that a lot of permits need to be issued to get out on the boat.
Besides, inside Russia, there's no place to fill up.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then there's a problem where to get it, says Nordmarine's sales director Denis Novikov.
With regard to yacht storage sites, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special yacht hangars up to 30 m. The yachts are also being deposited in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are rich people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts declined.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a $500 million loan.
The World Bank approved a new $500 million loan project for Ukraine to develop the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
“New financing will support a number of priority reform measures in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, the report states.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Qimiao Fan, said that banking sector reforms would help revive credit in the real economy and stimulate economic recovery.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank was witnessing initial signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
The Polish government had previously approved a loan in the US$100 million Ukraine, transmitting the RIA News.
Prisons are asked to set up separate units for transgender people.
The Public Council of the Federal Penal Correction Service (FSIN) for the Protection of the Rights of Convicted Persons will discuss, among other matters, the possibility of establishing separate units for transgender and transvestites in the colonies in October 2015.
That's what Board member Vladislav Grib told the News.
In his view, depending on the total number of convicted persons in Russia who had not determined the sex, it was possible to have separate cells, blocks or even (if there were many such criminals) in domestic prisons in the future to establish a special colony for transgender persons.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is only possible to determine whether citizens will serve their sentences in such isolated places once the convicted persons have undergone appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgender persons from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice worked successfully abroad: the remand centre (where the accused were held pending trial) had separate cells for transgender persons and special units in correctional facilities.
Today, it's the only way to work with such criminals.
Clearly, they need to be isolated because the presence of transvestites and transgenders in regular cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and the sea of problems for FSI staff.
The humiliation of trances by fellow inmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big a city, how many criminals with an uncertain sex, you have to calculate where to distribute them.
There's no need for solitary confinement, just cells, prison blocks.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
As Gryb explained, the block could hold 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps was established in Russia alone, transsexual prisoners from any region would be able to go there to serve their sentences.
Citizens are held in the remand centre at the place where the crime was committed, so the admission of transvestites or transgender persons from other entities during the investigation and trial is not feasible, but the introduction of such a practice for convicted persons in a separate colony - yes - considers the Mushroom.
As will be recalled, the day before, law enforcement officials were unable to determine whether a male or female detention facility had been established for possession of drugs by a 24-year-old transsexual, Dmitry Kojukov (known as Alina Davis), which prevented the arrest of a man with a female appearance.
He was released home on a non-departure subscription.
This news has been widely discussed on social media and the media, as the mechanisms for holding transgender persons in SIZOs and colonies in Rocia are not yet in place.
Russian human rights defender, LGBT activist (LGBT lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals), Nikolai Alekseyev, supported the idea of creating special places for transgender people to serve their sentences, noting that it was also possible to identify persons in the colony abroad, male or female, depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the offer is correct.
Yeah, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, just like the issue of ensuring that homosexuals are safe in prisons, says Alexei.
Prisons must be safe, so separate blocks could be made in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially as there are more of them in prisons than transgender people.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia willing to impersonate transsexuals in order to get into a different colony from ordinary ones.
Of course, you can introduce a medical examination before putting people in a colony for transgender people, but it's not always clear.
For example, in the United States, one of Chelsea Menning's inmates looked like a man, and already in prison, he said he wanted to change the floor, ” said Alexey.
A person can feel like anything.
But as long as there are no separate places to serve the sentence for transgender people, I doubt that prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people and understand the subtleties of their orientation or sexual identity.
At the same time, the international reproductive health expert on the territory of the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders in the colony could greatly delay the commencement of the sentence of convicts.
A commission is set up - it's a matter of sexology, psychiatrists do long-term observations, it's not one test on which a highly accurate opinion is based.
Today's mental health opportunities allow for that.
Therefore, before the change of gender, potential patients always undergo such tests - they clearly show whether the change of sex with surgical intervention is a necessary measure, says Lord Kipanidzee.
However, I find it difficult to see how this system can be implemented with regard to convicted persons, since on average it takes a month for such an examination.
The doctor, while generally supporting the idea of establishing separate units for transgender people, also questions whether, under the current economic conditions, it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical expertise, transgenders in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but considering that homosexuals in Russia are around 5%, it can be said that transgender people are even smaller, and those who have such a deviation and commit crimes are very few,” said Lord Kipanidzee.
Now, upon application to the administration of the colony, homosexuals and transgender persons can receive separate conditions of detention.
Michael Antipops won the Junior World Chess Championship.
The Hunty-Mansiysk World Junior Chess Championships were completed under the age of 20.
The end of the first was more than intriguing.
The winner decided only on the last round, and became a Russian Michael Antipop who managed to catch up with the Polishman Jan-Kshishtof Doudu, who seemed to be walking towards the title confidently.
The girls had their victory celebrated by Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buks.
The World Chess Championships held since early September in Hunty Mansiysk, by the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all the intrigue, as Polish representative Jan-Kshishtof Douda, who issued a series of four wins (the Swiss system competition in 13 rounds) confidently captured leadership.
Given that Douda was a ranking-favorite of the first, and is generally considered to be one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he would miss out on the breakout seemed very small.
And even when Douda slowed down and allowed the Russian Michael Antipop to reduce his underachievement to only 0.5, he remained an obvious favorite in the title struggle.
After all, Antipop had to win in the 13th round to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help, win Duda your party.
Plus this compulsory victory, of course, could have affected the game of the Russian chess player and led to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipops managed to avoid them.
He dealt confidently with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he had to wait for Douda to complete his party, who met with Benjamin Bock.
Fortunately for Antipopa, the Polish chess player brought the Dutch man up against him in a draw.
Thus, Antipops and Douda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipop had the best extras.
It is therefore to him that the leadership of the Hunta-Mansian Autonomous District, whose Governor Natalia Komarova, has traditionally devoted great attention to the development of chess in the region, has been awarded the main prize.
But the girls' competition didn't have an intriguing ending.
The tournament leader, Natalia Buxe (Ukraine), enough to win the title was not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russian woman Alina Bivol prevented her from catching up with Buxa.
The Russian athlete remained second with 0.5 points behind the champion.
The gyppelcom is changing the regional structure.
The company combines the Volgian and Ural regions into one larger Volg-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East into the East region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As pointed out by Michael Sloboddin, the CEO of Wympelcoma, changes are being made to "stay a strong player in the market", to develop a company "in a new, not always favourable external environment."
In an interview with the television channel Russia 24, Mr. Sloboddin explained that they intended to reduce “ten percent” of the staff in Russia.
Rospornadzor checked 78 Moscow Burger King diners and issued 367 orders.
As a result, a restaurant on the Volokolam Highway was fined 50,000 rubles, and a facility on the Great Tula Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed after all violations had been remedied.
Forty-three diners violated the requirements for space.
Among other violations, poor sanitation and hygiene facilities, and non-compliance with ventilation requirements have been found in some facilities by the bacteria of the intestinal cord group.
The franchise on the Burger King brand is owned by Burger Ruz, owner of the Chocolate Network by Alexander Kolobov, and there are 293 diners in Russia.
Igor Artemiyev, head of the FAS, stated that the agency was against indexing 10% of freight tariffs and granting state subsidies, as requested by the OAO of the RZD.
At first, they wanted 17% of the indexation, now they want 10%, and also a multibillion-dollar budget subsidy, he says.
We say it's wrong, it's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money on the left and the right.
He added that the FAS had its own, "more stringent" proposals, which were currently being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net-calculation option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of performing a $300 million-full-value stock swap, the gold mining company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the price of issuing shares in favour of Sumeru and market quotations), which can be taken from the free flow of money.
Sumeru has time until October 3 to implement the option or to demand additional payments.
The details of the talks at Polymetal don't reveal.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of the Polymetal project Kyzyl in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Department of Housing Policy of Minstroy, reported that the Ministry, together with the Central Bank, was developing a procedure for the sanitation of developers.
"We realize we're not going anywhere from this, so we're working on a mechanism," said the official.
Scripts of Citizen Kane are going to be traded.
Representatives of the auction house Profiles in History reported plans to tender draft versions of the Citizen Kane script, which is considered one of the best works of director, writer and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will begin in Calabas City on September 29, and will present three draft versions of the script, each with an estimated cost of $20,000 to $30,000, and transmits the AP.
The first of the drafts, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevich, is the earliest script in private collections? and is entitled "American" - the working name of the film.
The second draft is a more complete version of the script, and the third is the film's final plan.
Minpromtorg: Targeted food aid will not be the equivalent of cards in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Evtukhov, reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be akin to the food distribution card system that existed in the USSR.
These include modern targeted food aid to the population and support for an effective domestic commodity producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food card."
I would like to point out in particular that the proposed product maps should not be confused with the backlash of the past total deficit, the distribution card system in which the number of products received is normalized.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation," the TASS quotes Mr. Evtukhov's words.
I used to write that a program to introduce food cards for the poor is in the government.
For more information on the Minpromtorg initiative, read "I" "The Shuval Igor has commissioned the preparation of food cards".
The president of the Rosgosstraha wants to divorce his wife.
A source familiar with the situation informed RAPSI that Danil Khachatarov, president of the insurance company Rosgosstrah, had filed a lawsuit with the Moscow court for the dissolution of the marriage with designer Uljan Sergienko.
Court of Justice No. 100 will take up the case on 16 September.
Danil Khachathurov asks for the divorce of his marriage and the sharing of the property.
The court confirmed the existence of a divorce suit in the proceedings, noting that the division of property had not been, and would be, brought before a district court.
President Alexander Bobreshov of RZD resigns from his post.
OAO's Vice President of the Russian Railways (RZD) for Corporate Security Alexander Bobreshov leaves the company, reports Interfax, referring to the source.
Vice Prime Minister of Russia, Chairman of the Board of Directors of RZD Arkady Dvorkovich stated that the issue of the withdrawal of Alexander Bebreshov from RZD had been initiated by the new head of the company Oleg Belozerov.
According to the vice-premier, the reshuffles in the management of the RZD are not related to the change of the head of the company.
Previously, I reported that, instead of Vladimir Yakunin OAO, the RZD was led by the first Deputy Minister of Transport, Peterburger Oleg Belozer, who supervised the financial bloc.
The new head of the company first announced reforms in monopoly: in a year and a half, a new system of freight tariffs will be set up.

This year's study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top 1000 Russian Managers" is released for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of top-level Russian managers, the study takes stock of the work of Russian managers over the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional directions.
The initial pool of candidates consists of last year's ranking winners.
Last year's winners are invited to confirm their participation as the current year's ranking candidate and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial list is invited to nominate up to 10 new managers from other companies who would be useful to add to the pool of candidates.
The following directors of the company ' s functional areas may be nominated: Finance Director, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, Staff Director, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Government Relations, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert proposed manager is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate a management team and up to 10 new managers from other companies.
Industry-based nominations are based on the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forest and forest processing industry, engineering, media, steel, multidisciplinary holding, professional services, communications and telecommunications, service and consumer goods production, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to access the website www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see the information on the remaining participants and can provide their estimates on the criteria proposed for each functional area.
The rating methodology is based on the "best picks best" principle: top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle provides the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final outcome of the rating is approved at expert commission meetings.
All interested current-year ranking candidates and multiple past-year ranking candidates are invited to face expert commission meetings.
The Commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission for the approval of the list of top managers and eight commissions for the approval of the heads of functional areas.
At expert commission meetings, it is proposed that the lists submitted be approved in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly according to the Internet assessment and are classified information prior to publication of the rating) or that updates be made in accordance with the attached list of stand-by candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the rules of IO.
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
Comfort rate for investment is 10-13%.
Experts estimated that the small and medium-sized business credit market was 40 per cent off in January-April of this year.
What do you think the situation is today?
After the panic of late 2014 - early 2015, lending to HCMs declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
A 25-30% loan was no benefit to anyone.
If the bank had previously been able to put all of its possible problems into an increased rate in the future, ranging from delays to non-returns, it is impossible to do so now: the rates are already over-the-counter.
For business, the current level of HCMs lending rates is uncomfortable.
For much of the investment projects, the current level is not acceptable in terms of return.
A rate of 10-13% would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns on them.
How do you estimate that the demand of entrepreneurs for credit is being met?
The situation has improved slightly since the interest rate was lowered by the CB.
Credit resources have become more readily available.
However, according to our observations, clients have become much less likely to apply for loans.
In the first place, business does not understand its development prospects and future revenues.
Today, business has one option: it is necessary to learn how to work in the light of today’s economic situation in the country and the region.
There is a need to monitor current results more closely and to monitor cash flows.
At the same time, if financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to upgrade equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this ultimately allows the company to make products more competitive and to maintain business even in a volatile economic situation.
What are the main trends in the HCMs lending market that will be stronger and have an impact on its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast of a lower average rate will depend largely on the Central Bank policy, and the regulator is now showing consistency in lowering the key rate.
However, a radical fall in credit prices for HCMs is not worth waiting for.
In the current situation, inflation is primarily the problem, making an increased interest rate necessary to generate real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even if the CB rates fall.
In terms of the level of delay, traditionally small and medium-sized business companies, limited in both cash replenishment and adjustment options, would certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country ' s economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is spelled by Japanese hieroglyphics.
Beautiful, concise, and at the same time quite difficult for those who are used to Cyrillic or Latin.
So is the new CX-5 crossover, as is any other brand model: without dazzling, attractive from the outside, technically perfect inside.
Japanese is simply because of its "Japanese" ability to bring the country's high-rise country's attachment to products to a state of complete delight.
You can make as many arguments as you want in favor of cars from other countries, and a man will even agree with those arguments in principle, but the whole conversation is spread out from the final phrase, "But it's a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about.
Such people probably should love not only technology, but everything else Japanese.
Quote with Base's move, sew up Vasabi's food, collect katanas, and dress your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but in the canons of street Japanese fashion: nice, creative, and quite unexpectedly.
Perhaps the Japanese school uniform is the only form girls wear with pleasure after graduation.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in appearance of CX-5 is the radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But the image of the car is much more changed by the new pattern of the headlights and rear lamps, by which the car instantly learns in the traffic flow.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms sensual, but the appearance has an overflight of severity.
You don't have to call the police.
CX-5, one of the safest in the world, can only be tested with stoic Japanese calm.
A 2.2 litre diesel engine provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 hp-only 5.9 h. The powertrain shall be assembled exclusively by an automatic transmission and a full drive.
Black shoes, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can select leggings with a print from the Not Cross police tape.
However, Mazda made every effort to keep you out of your own car accident while driving CX-5.
To further improve comfort while maintaining excellent control, the suspensions redesigned the front and rear shock absorbers and optimized the shape of the front lower lever linings.
The full drive system has been adapted to Russian conditions.
High speed road and engine noise is reduced by 13 per cent.
The flower bath or strip is as boring as the budget sedan.
That's not the case if a girl walks in a bathing suit with an original drawing.
For example, from a role-playing computer game.
She'll have as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved structure for both front and rear seats, providing an optimal reserve of space for both broad shoulders and for long legs - who has what.
Longfoots will certainly appreciate the fact that the thrusts in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and don't hit the ankles in the swivels.
The widest range of Mazda active security systems is proposed at CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to detect a potential threat.
There's also adaptive lighting, and a warning to get off the lane, and monitoring the dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
Comfortable, with minimum projections, it carries a 561-litre load. The rear seats are folded in a 4:2:4 proportion, each section being equipped with a separate pulley - and increasing the baggage compartment to 1,560 litres.
The cartoon hero suit in Japan is called "kigurumy".
It's especially spicy looking like kigrumi pajamas.
There's nothing in it!
Of course you're sleeping.
But also, entertaining little kids.
Or just walking around like that down the street...
'Cause it's so great to have a choice-- cool clothes, behavior, or a car.
Thank you for your help in the preparation of the Kawaicat store.
Kiev tore apart the atomic fusion.
Kiev officially formalized Ukraine's refusal to cooperate with Russia on the Khmelnitka nuclear plant.
The Supreme is pleased on Wednesday from the second attempt, yet voted to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the completion of the third and fourth clusters had been signed as early as 2010-2012, but it had not been possible to proceed with the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law terminating the 2010-2012 agreement with the Russian Federation to build a third and fourth block on the Khmelnitka nuclear power plant.
The bill introduced by the Government had been passed only with a second vote, with 210 deputies supporting it for the first time, with a minimum of 226, but 234 members of Parliament voting in favour.
The Hmelnicki nuclear power plant, which was laid down under the USSR, was to consist of four power units of 1 GW each with VRE-type reactors, but only two had been built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the completion led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and Rada passed relevant laws in 2011-2012.
Since Ukraine had no budget, it was expected that the blocks would have to be built on Russian credit, but the funds had never been disbursed.
Following the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent chilling between the two countries, Kiev began to close relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing a refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant and on a project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations remained was the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for the existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (which provided about half of the electricity generation in the country), since the Ukrainian NAC “Energoat” had not yet been able to replace Russian supplies.
Plans for the pre-construction of the Khmelnitka NPP with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been finalized: as early as 2014 in Kiev, talks were announced with the Czech Skoda JS.
The UN General's against the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported during a press conference that the situation in Syria cannot be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution," quotes AP's answer to a question about Russian military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also reported that he would meet with the Foreign Ministers of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Nikolai Bogdanovsky, reported that the General Staff did not exclude the possibility of establishing an air force base in Syria in the future.
There are no plans yet.
"But things may be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Previously, I reported that the United States did not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to official Damascus was necessary to combat the Islamic State terrorist group banned in the Russian Federation.
For more details of the US's doubts about Russian aid to Syria, read in "I" "Russian military presence in Syria concerns Washington".
In the PA, OSCE reports a possible meeting of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), Arthur Gerasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentarian colleagues to discuss the situation in south-eastern Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," the TASS quotes Mr. Gerasimov's words.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and for “returning to normal activities of our countries”.
On the question of whether, in his view, dialogue between Ukraine and Russia was currently possible at the parliamentary level - in a “normand format” or as a contact group on the OSCE PA site - Mr. Gerasimov observed that the dialogue had taken place, there were Minsk agreements.
At the same time, politicians say that all types of dialogue are maintained in Kiev.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, former President Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics had not fundamentally changed their positions in the tripartite talks, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Lower Novgorod Electoral Commission summarized the city dumu elections by municipal district, distributing 12 seats on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral irregularities have been raised by representatives of CRC, who have accused the vilification of fraud.
The opposition ' s comments were not accepted.
In addition, the Communist Party of Russia refused to organize a referendum on the cancellation of the payment for the refurbishment of apartment buildings.
The town beater officially presented the election results to the proud Nizhny Novgorod by municipal constituency.
A total of 1.03 million people were included on the electoral roll in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand ballots were issued to the district commissions and 268,000 voters voted in the election.
More than 11,700 ballots were declared invalid and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of “One Russia”, six seats in pride rely on Dmitry Swatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnova, Vasili Shupranova, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rastäláev and Igor Nagornyna.
The only mandate of the LDPR was given to the leader of the party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the CRC are divided between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma member Alexander Tarnaev.
Three mandates of Fair Russia are given to Alexander of Rasumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will serve as MPs in the city's Duma: in the event that the mandate is waived, he will proceed to the next party list candidate.
The Chairman of the Gorizbirkoma, Alexander Makeev, informed the commission that he was putting on duty to "distribution of telegrams to Girinovsky and others" in order to waive the mandates.
In approving the election report, CRC representatives reported multiple violations.
A member of the Gorizbirkom, with the right to a deliberative vote from CRCF, Leonid Krasnokutsky, proposed not to recognize the vote in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, had been closed by order of the Chief of Administration of the Sormovsky District.
Neither the members of the Gos of the Udrama nor the candidates themselves nor the observers could pass in for a long time, and the resonant scandal of storming the doors of the Rayadian administration was shown on television.
All observers and panel members were able to attend the district commissions with the right to vote.
They were not allowed access by the head until the voting ended and the district commissions had not yet arrived to issue their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the chapter was corrected, and at all the meetings the interested persons could be present," was a member of the mountains beat up by Natalia Andrushin.
The Communists objected that in the blocked administration building, MP Ludmila Aristov had been illegally detained for more than four hours in the district hall, on which a statement had been sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that in a number of UIRs on election day, urns began to be sealed at 6-7 in the morning, placing early ballot papers on them.
In so doing, the members of the commissions with the right to vote and observers were not notified, so they arrived at the beginning of the election at 8 a.m.
The Communists are confident that in the morning hours before the opening of the polling stations, ballot papers could be thrown into the urns uncontrollably.
However, the mountains, which had already dealt with more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makeev, found no irregularities in the score of the unrecorded ballots.
Nor did the members of the commission support the proposal of her colleague from Fair Russia, Maria Popova, to issue, through the oiquirk, amendments to regional legislation in order to clearly set the time for opening the envelopes with the early ballot papers, which would then enter the urn.
"As a matter of your own initiative, go to the CIC," advised Mrs Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, a high-profile accusations were levelled against the chairman, Sergei Samohin, a member of CRCF, who shouted that the beater ignored dozens of complaints and covered up election frauds.
"You're not here at the rally, be careful!" The chairman of the buffalo was offended.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the polling officer must approve the overall election results, after which the first meeting of the 6th Legislature Lower Novgorod city dummies will be scheduled for three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the City Election Commission refused to register the initiative group for a local referendum by the Communists of Russia political party.
According to the documents, the parties were going to bring two questions to the discussion: whether they agreed that the house repairs fees should be "immediately cancelled" and that the housing and public utility rates should be "freeze until 2020".
However, Douma lawyer Irina Maslova explained that the "Communists of Russia"'s application was contrary to the law.
FedEx revenue is mixed, decreasing projections for 2016.
FedEx reported on the disappointing results of the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced the forecast of annual profits due to falling demand for freight services and increasing costs in its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it planned to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares have increased by about 2.5 per cent in pre-bidding 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that it planned to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous projection.
Analysts assumed $10.84 according to FactSet review.
The forecast is declining despite an average rate increase of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and an increase in land freight charges for heavy or bulk cargo, which begins in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase revenue over the previous year by reducing expenditure, raising gross income and increasing online trade.
The chairman and CEO, Fred Smith, stated that the company “worked steadily in view of weak economic conditions, especially in production and world trade, compared to forecast”.
Recruitment plans for the holidays were announced the day after a competitor, UPS, announced that they were planning to hire an additional 95,000 employees, approximately the same number they hired last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than a year earlier.
The share earned $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 per share conducted by the Zacks Investment Research poll of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in the international fixed-term transport sector, resulting in a lack of growth in gross income in its express transport unit.
However, the Internet shopping boom dramatically improved the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land transport revenue increased by 29%, but operating revenues remained largely unchanged due to higher costs of large departures and self-insurance.
The express transport unit earned higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector, income fell due to higher pay costs.
On pre-bidding, about an hour before the opening of the stock exchange, FedEx stock dropped by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 percent in a year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in a few years, Federal Reserve leaders will spend two days this week at the 27-foot table of the Honduran red tree, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At one end, a richly decorated two-story meeting room will be overlaid by a wall image of the United States.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must place the country ' s economic interests above all others.
The Central Bank received a double commission from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and keep stable prices there.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third, unwritten assignment: financial stability.
And this third assignment may prove to be an unknown factor in an almost predicted decision that will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Even though most data show strong economic growth, recent shocks in global financial markets can keep already cautious Federal system leaders from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds – even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject to be considered," said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist of the brokerage company Steel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise the stakes that increased uncertainty around the world market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she remarked.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself provokes financial market fluctuations.
About half of the economists recently interviewed Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, are expected to keep the Federal System from doing so, with a key indicator showing only about 30 per cent of the likelihood of rapid recovery.
This may lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal System raises the stake, provided that decision makers do not soften the blow with a promise that the next increase will not be short-lived.
On Tuesday, the Dow-Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The take-off was triggered by expectations that the Federal System's policymakers would leave the bet this week,” said John Lonsky, the group's chief economist, Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It will be a surprise if the Federal System increases the stakes at this point in time," he remarked.
If the Federal Reserve executives do this, "they'll have to go far in approving their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so they don't panic."
Other experts objected that an increase in the rate could calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty as to how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal System seemed to be inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of US recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she expected the rate to rise this year, despite complaints from the Liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the growth of the labour market was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 per cent last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years, and almost at the level considered full employment in the Federal System.
Wage increases show signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to fall below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the Federal System’s management stated that the key reason was the temporary effect of a sharp fall in oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher rates as well, and needs them, given the decline in the labour market," observed Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow-Jones average equity index for industrial companies fell by as much as 16% relatively high in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy could slow global growth.
The market partially regained its position this month, and the Dow-Jones index is now about 10% below the high May value.
For Federal Reserve management, market outrage further complicates difficult calculations of the interest rate increase time.
"In the absence of information on what happened in the financial markets and news of China's economic weakness over the past few weeks, they would be twisting nuts at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior UCLA researcher Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Federal Reserve employee.
Now, he predicts that they will wait for at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
"There is a great uncertainty as to what the impact on the American economy may be, and they have little reliable data since recent events in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal System and should not be technically taken into account in these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve has become a global financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
One hint from then-president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "shut down" its monetary expansion has caused market turmoil around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, leaders of the Federal Reserve system could be expected not only to monitor developments everywhere, but also to consult with representatives of other Headquarters banks and experts in order to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process - “a sooner art than science” - was noted by Zachary Carabell, the leader of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, president of Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, Virginia, noted this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve, there have been instances of excessive reactions to financial market movements that do not seem to be linked to economic principles."
Lacker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who insisted on raising the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis led the Federal System to reduce its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three sessions, "despite the limited identifiable impact on US growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Federal system leaders lifted these cuts.
The federal reserve system should be put first only in times of major crises such as the 2008 market collapse," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the interest-rate committee at Bank of England.
The last panic didn't get close to that level, he said.
"You wouldn't, of course, want to be in a situation where you're terrified of rising rates because markets are in shock," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute of the World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to have a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be ahead of events.

Although there may be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually easy to find.
The Speaker of the State Duma, Sergei Narishkin, admits that the US will deliberately destabilize the situation in the Middle East to allow waves of refugees to surge into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this view to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a supporter of conspirological theories, but is it not Europe the ultimate goal of those who, with such manic insistence in recent years, have destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East?" he wondered.
"Because someone must have thought and knew that the outflows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who escape death, would rush to the prosperous countries of the EU," he added.
Narishkin asked, "Do many European political leaders have openly spoken about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is now literally flooding their countries?".
"No, old Europe, with a few exceptions, prefers to remain silent," he said.
According to Narishkin, NATO flouts many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially watched and watched how the military boots, sewn in accordance with NATO standards, are also trampled on moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” the speaker stressed.
Government forces and loyal militias are confronted by insurgents, composed mainly of Islamists.
Subsequently, the terrorist group Islamic State, banned in Russia, joined the opponents of the Syrian government.
The US supports the rebels that confront both Assad and IG.
Official Damascus considers such insurgents to be terrorists.
The President of Syria has cited the West's aversion to Russia.
The Western claims against countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign states.
This view was expressed by Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners or sovereign States.
In those countries, he wished to remove one person and place another in his place, who would act in the interests of Western countries rather than in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the abrupt turn of the Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
To them, he said, Russian President Vladimir Putin "turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a king, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came to power undemocraticly, despite being elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West."
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West's constant statements that Assad himself should go away, he noted that the President came to power with the people's consent, through elections, and if he did, at the people's request, not by decision of the United States, the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
"If the people want them to stay, the president stays, or else they should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad described Russia and Iran as friendly countries and recalled that they were cooperating with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
Referring to Iranian military support, the Syrian leader observed that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, the economy and the military.
He denied the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
“It is natural that there is an exchange of military expertise between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place”, he explained.
For the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to combat terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-ihil coalition led by the United States," Assad pointed out.
The death toll exceeded 230,000 and the number of refugees 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was occupied by the terrorist group Islamic State, which was banned in Russia.
An international coalition led by the United States strikes at the positions of the IG from the air.
In Utah, 12 people were killed by the flood.
In the U.S. state of Utah, at least 12 people died as a result of the flooding.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is reported by Reuters with reference to John Kirby's State Department spokesman.
It is noted that the subject of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any further details.
In doing so, he stated that the US has tools for "further isolation of Russia", if it supports Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, transmits RIA News.
As reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lavrov, in a conversation with Kerry, again stressed the need to establish a unified front against terrorist groups operating in that country.
Ways of resolving the Ukrainian crisis and possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula were also discussed.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Earlier, American officials stated that Russia was building up its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern over the strengthening of Moscow's support for Assad.
Washington stated that if Russia continued to support Assad, it would be even more isolated from the international community.
In response, spokesman for Russian President Dmitry Peskov stated that the country would not be subjected to international isolation.
The rebels advocate the overthrow of the Assad regime.
A terrorist organization, the Islamic State, has seized part of the territory.
An international coalition led by the United States is attacking IG positions with air strikes.
Beardai called the information of the American newspaper a defamation of the Arrow.
Former Prime Minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic Alexander Borodai denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He stated this in a phone interview to the correspondent for Lenta.ru.
The note at Washington Post is beautiful because it's been re-drawn.
Former DNR defense minister Igor Arrowkov naturally did not tie up and "get out" him from Donbass Republic territory in a very uplifted mood, without ropes, without three fur money attributed to him by different characters," he noted.
According to Beardai, this was actually about the Arrow in a conversation with an American newspaper reporter.
"Yes, I said the Arrow was urgently required to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former head of the DNR government.
Beardai stressed that he did not know why a correspondent for an American publication had decided to write that the Arrows had been taken to Russian territory "bounded".
I suspect it's provocation.
If this is not provocation, these are surprisingly misunderstood words, as I stressed that the Arrows had left on their own," Beardai observed.
"It's slander against both me and the Arrow," he concluded.
Previously, an article appeared on The Washington Post that quoted Beardaj's words that he had forcibly taken the Arrow to Russian territory.
According to the publication, Beardai noted that he was forced to tie up his companion.
The Polish authorities have begun to search for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
The Polish loggers began cutting trees above the underground tunnel, where there is some evidence of a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, reports Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary in order to verify the reliability of the rumours of the train with the treasures.
Armaments and valuable minerals can be found inside the train.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Nizhnesiles Voivodeship, Tomaz Smolarz, suggested that new evidence of the existence of a gold train was nothing more convincing than previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cordon the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland's Deputy Minister of Culture, Peter Žukhowski, stated that local treasure detectors with a "probability of 99 per cent" found the very train with the Third Reich gold referred to in legends.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the jewels found, they would become the property of the State treasury, with the treasures not being handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of a law firm contacted the Polish city of Walbzhih to report that they had found a train in a sealed tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The main drug addict of the Russian Federation has proposed that the sale of tobacco to persons under the age of 21 should be prohibited.
Russia's main drug addict has proposed banning the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Eugeny Brun noted that until this age "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is particularly harmful."
So he said live on Radio "Speaking Moscow" commenting that Sovfed Speaker Valentin Matvienko had supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
Man is growing unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, and the man is physically ready for it.
Mentally, he's been ready for a full life in society since he was 21.
"It is known from scientific evidence that the brain, its biochemistry, is only finally ripening by 21," Brun noted.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the “Trestrial Russia” project, Sultan Hamzaev, told News that Matvienko had supported an initiative to raise the age limit for the sale of alcohol and “agreed with the Public Chamber to raise the issue again on the upper house of Parliament”.
According to the activist, a working group would soon be set up in the Federation Council to draft a bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to test compliance with the Child Information Protection Act
A resident of Novosibirsk asked the Regional Prosecutor's Office to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law “On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development”, a statement was read on 16 September by correspondent Sib.fm.
The author stated that on 26 August 2015, he had purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society at the Chinese City Store on the Red Avenue.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his view, violated the FZ “On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development”.
On 16 September, the application was accepted by the Prosecutor's Office of Novosibirsk.
A response to the appeal from the resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, the complainant commented to correspondent Sib.fm.
Moreover, it is a very fundamental problem that will elevate society.
It will start to reread the Bible, which it has never done before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatricians Rio Grandi promotes healthy nutrition for breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS has come up with a scandalous method by which to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves showing images of infants sucking breasts, plotted with images of harmful food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
In view of the high energy needs, it is recommended that pregnant and newborn women increase the daily calorie rate by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that one increase in calories is not the only change in diet that mothers have to make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy nutrition for pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents their developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child ' s immune system has been identified.
Under Hamburg, the train rammed a school bus.
Near Hamburg, the train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on the railway.
A 23-year-old female driver, realizing that she could not move off the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute after that, they had a collision in front of their eyes.
It was videotaped by one of the school kids.
The emergency caused panic among the students.
Some children began to cry and run along the side of the road.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was injured except one passenger of the train who was slightly injured.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300,000 euros.
The doctors call for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of injuries sustained in a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The battle for one of the regional International Boxing Federation (IBF) titles in the weight category of up to 57.15 kg, held on Friday, ended with Magaly's knockout victory in the 12th round.
Brown was in the hospital with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to a life support machine.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 wins, suffered only two defeats, and one fight ended in a draw.
He has two children left.
This is the second death toll among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, Braydon Smith, a 23-year-old student, died of injuries sustained in the ring.
The AMA now recommends not engaging in this sport, but rather, in its view, banning it at all.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally,” stated the organization's vice president, Stephen Parnis.
But as boxing now exists, there will always be situations where an athlete gets haemorrhage or brain injury, leading to either death or severe damage.
For that reason, the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure bringing together medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
Russian State Duma Speaker Sergei Narishkin called it unacceptable to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
He stated this by addressing the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We view this as unacceptable action, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not happen again because it is a manifestation of political shame and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue," said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on the OSCE PA to re-establish the Russian-EU partnership.
Let's get the morality back to politics.
Let us restore dialogue and the law to the practice of international communication.
Let us restore humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
"The doubles never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
"First, on the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group," Narishkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE must be commended.
"It's almost the only common ground where people are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
Let us recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until 18 September.
Enjoying the win for a couple or three days.
World Athletics Championship Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be described as triumphal for a 24-year-old tracker from Barnaul by Sergei Shubenkov.
He managed to win at his 110 metres crown distance with barriers in Europe's command championship, set several records and, above all, become the world champion, the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Diamond League, taking overall third place.
The News has asked Shubenkov to share his impressions from the passing season.
Sergei, isn't the season over for you?
Yeah, I'm going to play at the World War Games in Korea in October, and then I'm going to be thinking about rest.
Really, I'm going to be studying at home in Barnaul, and being home is still a very different condition.
It's easier than running around the world every week.
You once said autumn was your favorite time of the year.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a beautiful time.
The passions after the main start of the season have waned, the burden of responsibility no longer squeezing.
We can fight with pleasure, at the "silver."
Plus, you know, the vacation's coming up soon...
Are you tired?
After all, it's a special season, a lot of positive emotions...
Fatigue always accumulates by the end of the season.
And it doesn't matter what you did more, win or lose.
Every competition is stress.
Regular flights, moving-- all of this doesn't go without a trace to the body.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
I'm just happy.
By the time you finished at the Beijing World Cup, do you return often?
It happens.
And you journalists won't let me forget that.
But in general, I think it's bad for an athlete who lives in old wins to run his successful runs over and over again.
Enjoying the win for a couple or three days, and we have to move on.
The preparations for this wonderful season were very different from the usual one?
I can't say there was anything so special.
We started getting ready in December, but I missed the winter competitive season.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at the gatherings, then at home again.
It's the usual.
But with the coach, they set the goal of trying to get to a new level that I haven't been to yet.
Almost all winter time was spent laying a foundation.
They ran a bunch of sneaks, they did exercise on general physical training, which included both traction and sitting, and we pumped our backs.
Afterwards, they took on barrier training, and they did a lot of engineering.
Have you been watching your rivals perform?
I always try to do that, there's no problem in the Internet era.
I saw the European Winter Championship, and the French took the whole pedestal in the barrier sprint!
I thought I'd do something, dilute this company.
With each start this season, you added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've had all the last seasons going about the same pattern.
There's no way I'm running 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always twist my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All work focused on this result.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready to do something, and you don't always get to show your readiness in competitions.
How was it, for example, at the London Olympics?
I, to be honest, that semi-final race (Shubenkov couldn't fit into the finals.
I was ready to be very good, I could really run out of 13 seconds.
Even if I had repeated my best result at the time, I would have been the bronze medalist of the Games.
But bad luck.
Remember your first World Cup?
What about it?
That was in Tagu.
I really wanted to get into the finals at the time, and there was this maximum program.
And fell right off the morning, in the preliminary races.
That's when I realized to tear my head off, it means never running anywhere.
Two years later, at the Moscow World Cup, he was already in the final with a better time.
I remember my feelings well before the crucial race: I wanted to win the gold at the time!
How does it work if you're fast enough not to lose your head, not to pass out?
That's the hardest part.
You have to be very careful, focused on technology, so you don't get out of the way.
I've noticed that it's a lot easier when you adjust to the process, not the result.
And it's fun when you feel like you're running and it's like you're doing it all by yourself!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the interior, after their first major success, are trying to move closer to the capital.
You've never thought of anything like that?
It's better at home anyway.
I don't know where I'm going without my coach, who needs me?
It might be nice to have better terms, but I'm trying to be happy with what I have.
How long have you two been together?
Since he was 12 years old, since he came to athletics.
I mean, first I trained with his wife, who worked with the kids, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then I jumped in length, triple.
The children's lot was when they throw the ball, jump in the length from the spot...
At 14 I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
Since the first race, it has been possible to meet the standard of the second adult.
That's what I'm doing.
There's never been a fear of barriers?
Somehow, I managed to get a deal with them.
But we've always had to work very hard on the technique.
There's been a lot of pain in one run!
But there's nothing left of this routine.
The technique needs to be sharpened all the time - to wake me up at night, I'd get up and run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing claims it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually review my runs, and I couldn't help myself.
But efficiency needs to be further worked out, there is no limit to perfection.
Aren't you afraid that winning a year before the Olympics will be a heavy burden on your shoulders?
As they say in such cases, I will try to live up to expectations.
If you've chosen this road, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, you don't have to feel any extra weight.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not naive enough to be surprised by the response to an interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, not feed them bread - give them, plant the enemy.
And even though I didn't wrap my flag around, and that's exactly what I said here a million times, and I didn't call anyone a real bastard, it hit me another time.
All my pseudo-friends were in a flash, and they just vanished.
The press I'm going through is so strong that even me, who's seen a species of kid, I think people are full of bellows.
It was like walking, walking, and you were attacked by a mob and you were getting all twigped up.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a howitzer, I'm old, I'm scared.
The other thing is no support.
I had no illusions, and now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so eat it.
And only assholes can give passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson.
I'd rather be a better journalist than a shameless job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili described the Crimean events in sharp shape:
What happened to the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I suppose the reference to how Khrushchev's drunk tried to sign something doesn't in any way fit into the overall picture of the human dormitory.
It's like coming to a neighbor and taking his apartment...
The war from the Kremlin has gone, and it will only end there.
I'm pretty sure, like in the summer of 2008, she started by calling some bastard from the Kremlin's prison.
I have an idea who it might have been...
Cobzon doesn't have much to live for.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, they demolished him a monument.
Of course, people remembered him as insulting their small homeland.
Reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seventh leads in the ranking despite Ninth's attempts to highlight the leaders' loss at Today Show
Carl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson's raid on Canberra to cover the consequences of the Liberal Party's announcement of the leader's release was unable to raise Today's rating significantly.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the capital of the state after Malcolm Turnbull's defeat of Tony Abbott.
The rival, Sunrise, with leading David Koch and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long international broadcast series, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
This distance torture did not seem to matter much to Australian television viewers, although Sunrise had 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to Today's 339,000 audience.
Today gained a little more than its rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000, compared with 330,000 at Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September Sunrise has 349,000 spectators versus 314,000 at Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!
Published by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
An important news for Seventh was an amazing 800 Words debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
A new drama about a newly widowed family father who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with her two children has gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics wondered if Thomson could handle a popular show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result is a loud answer, yes.
The X Factor Seventh remained in strong positions with an audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily bypassing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the Seventh, luck and failure mixed on the second evening of Chase Australia.
The first half hour (from 5 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.) of the new television quiz led by Andrew O'Keefee gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the figure jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGwire (613,000).
Monday night, the first half hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators and the second half an overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat raised 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia ratings for the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for the Million Dollar Minute, which failed to replay the McGwire show.

Three finalists agree that the Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who's he gonna pick?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellouse, Sarah McKay and Snowhan Marcosky may have accidentally made clear which one of them would win the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually remain in the Bachelorette is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who reached the finals, of course, remain silent about which one of them got his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snowy Marcoski, and Lana Devons-Fellos the day before the three girls were supposed to be left with two, they may have inadvertently given a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood remains silent until the finale of Thursday.
All three women enter the lyrical mood, telling of why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, purpose, family values, vitality as the reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
However, with their answers to the question, "If not you, who should get the last Vooda rose?" they could unwittingly tell which one of them actually won the heart of the Bachelor.
Devons-Fallows and Marcoski have no doubt called McCoy the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have had a good relationship since day one.
"From the moment I became a contestant, I felt the energy (Sarah) and the energy of Sam and realized that they were very suitable to each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about it," said Devons-Fallows.
"Sarah is a very open man, easy and fun with her," Marcoski added.
I saw them together, there's a attraction between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood are gonna make a great couple.
MacKay herself said that thanks to her home dates last week, she realized that Wood might be "the man."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized it was definitely not just a game -- I believed him with all my heart," she says.
When asked who Wood should choose if it wasn't her, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snow and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor show is released Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarrid Hayne had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in him after he moved to the United States - as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day last year.
But Hain chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Thomsul and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would leave Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which a former Australian rugby league player allowed on the first return pant in a win-win game with Minnesota 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another opportunity to return the pant, and also engaged him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself on the good side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of giving the newcomers a ride in front of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the match.
Club 49ers special reporter Cam Inman reported that Hain also received support from Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and to think about the next game.
Jarrid Hain lost the ball on the pant's return by the Minnesota Wakings team during the first quarter.
This was clearly not the beginning of his NHL debut, and his numerous Australian fans clearly did not count on it.
It was seen that Hain was fighting when leaving the field after losing the ball, and later he told the host of the show Hamish and Andy at Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a more unsuccessful start for his NFL career.
"It happens, you're just thinking about the next game and everything," Hayne said.
Hain compared his failure to his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when a ball shot in his credit zone brought Queensland's attempt.
Ultimately, this experience proved very useful to a 27-year-old player.
Hain photographed with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted the picture to Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under gun threat at Siberian airport.
Openly defying President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy stopped.
At the border of Hungary, there had been clashes between migrants and the police.
The refugees protested on the border of Serbia near the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which developed into clashes with law enforcement officials.
As a result, Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, transferring Reuters.
Migrants stone the police and try to tear down the border fence.
Support has been sent to the scene of the clashes, and police officers have responded to violent acts by migrants and their attempts to cross the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, refugees managed to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants fled into Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border by bus towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports BBC.
The authorities have allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and transport them from there to the necessary country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament tightened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of State borders, the prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, and an accelerated asylum procedure.
The Hungarian court had already found one migrant guilty of crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border illegally, and he would therefore be deported and would not be able to return to Hungary for one year.
Also, the Hungarian Parliament intends to consider in the near future the transfer of border protection responsibilities to the Hungarian armed forces to the Hungarian Parliament.
In late June, the Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175 km barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
Russian confessed to committing the largest cyber attack in U.S. history.
Accused of the largest cyberattack in U.S. history, Russian Vladimir Drinkman confessed to stealing over 160 million credit card numbers, reports Reuters.
During the New Jersey Federal Court trial, Drinkman admitted to conspiring to obtain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke of a conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen accused of cyberattacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the defendants' actions was estimated at $300 million.
"Such defendants as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy and national security," said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is facing 30 years imprisonment, as well as a fine of $1 million.
In sentencing, the court would take into account the confession of a Russian and possibly reduce his sentence.
Drinkman's sentence will be read out on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitri Smiljanc, was taken into custody.
The latter denies being responsible for the crimes he is accused of.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk with Russian support from the Bashar Al-Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power," says a report published on the U.S. State Department website.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fight against the Islamic State group (which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) as part of a coalition from over 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad "can never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also during a telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved through a political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of its support for the Assad regime.
The day before, White House spokesperson Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest suggested joining an international coalition that was conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
In recent times, the media have frequently reported the presence of Russian soldiers on Syrian territory.
To which the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, has stated that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and have helped Syrians to learn technology to use against Islamists.
Four died when police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police started firing rubber bullets into a crowd protesting the proposed new constitution of the country, as stated by the spokesman on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandei County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the district police chief, reported that more than 1,000 protesters gathered at a police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that police officers used tear gas, then fired in the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets, which are known to be lethal, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last in several weeks of violent protests in southern, plain Nepal, where the Madesi people claim that the new provinces under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests have also taken place in western Nepal, among Taru citizens who want their staff.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
On August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for several centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that claimed thousands of lives in April.
Legislators voted for articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials stated that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create a 900-job enterprise.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s as a center for the chemical industry, and has developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk was led by the new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
He presented the results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects to the Regional Correspondent.
Oleg Valeryevich, where did you start as mayor?
First of all, I reviewed the results of the financial and business audits and initiated an independent audit of local budget expenditure.
An audit of municipal property was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the volume of documents to five days.
Previously, the papers could go on for months.
Activities have been developed to improve the revenue base and optimize costs.
Last November, a Government retreat was held in Sayansk to address the socio-economic development of the Territory.
The city did not have any design and estimation documents (PPDs) for any of the sites.
Without this, Sayansk could not take part in federal programs.
We started by preparing POJA for roads, kindergarten, northern sewer and water.
Roadworks on two sections are already under way.
How is the President of the Russian Federation ' s decree on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
This positive demography has not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in kindergartens is one of the most pressing ones today.
Since 1 September, the 320-seat day care centre No. 10 has been closed for major repairs.
The estimated cost of repairs is 86 million rubles.
The city has not yet received such funds.
Last year, after the renovation, kindergarten No. 23 opened, and 200 children are now attending.
The repairs were made on the basis of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, with a cost of over 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the district government, funds were sought for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the People's Initiatives programme also helped.
There are plans to start building a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the number of children between the ages of one and a half and three.
There are no queues for children between the ages of three and seven.
Investors are interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city must be carried out primarily by Sayyan enterprises, and that it is they that must be provided with work.
As early as October, a 60-bed house for orphans in Leningrad neighbourhood is being put into operation.
With regard to construction, I would add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya that has entered the economy-class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 blocks will begin shortly.
In total, we have announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of homes that would like to participate in the programme.
One condition is that housing should not be more than 30,000 rubles per square metre, which includes a turnkey finish.
If we manage the assigned amounts, we will continue to participate in the programme.
As far as investors are concerned, we have other interesting projects.
At the time, the Sayyan Pig Complex was built on the territory and sold for no price in 2004.
We're working with the D.A.'s office on this deal.
Especially since the land under the facility is federal property.
Work is under way with Moscow, and 88 ha are to be transferred to regional property, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor willing to invest 1.5 billion roubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
We'll have 900 jobs with the piggy pox, which will be a great help to the city.
Is the institution of social partnership developed in Sayansk?
We have some 140 social and economic partnership agreements.
A large number of projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Enterprises such as the Eastern Centre, the Novo-Ziminsk TETC, the Saiyan Broiler LLC, the PC IDF, provide tangible support, and the management of these enterprises respond to all requests.
Just prior to the Day of the City of Saiyan Broiler, the city was given a children's town by East Centre, and a horseyard was renovated by the East Centre, where professionals were working with children to treat them with treatment, at a cost of more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsorship, it was possible to improve the area of the city registry.
The sponsors helped to celebrate City Day in a colorful manner.
As in the good old days, there was a parade involving city groups and organizations.
A city record, a book of Saiyan poets, was released.
The pioneers and people who have made a serious contribution to Sayansk's development have been given jubilee medals.
The patrons also participate in the City Charitable Foundation.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 800,000 roubles have been devoted to supporting talented boys, helping children in need of costly treatment, and supporting children from low-income families.
How are social staffing problems solved in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and subject teachers in the city.
The provision of housing for professionals is crucial to addressing the human resources issue.
Over the past year, we have provided five apartments for doctors, and four teachers have received service accommodation.
We have a housing programme in place with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
The plan is to remodel the building, which will have eight more apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the “Housing for the Russian Family” programme.
In the long run, construction of a house for budget workers.
Most importantly, there's a working team in town with which I can handle the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
Sayansk and our region have great potential.
A bill has been introduced in the Duma to index social pensions in the light of price increases.
A bill has been introduced in the State Duma providing for the indexation of social pensions every year since 1 February, taking into account the increase in prices.
Aleksandr Lomakin-Romyants, a member of the “Just Russia”, also proposes an additional indexation of pensions on 1 April if the rate of increase in the subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of increase in the prices of goods and services.
Social pensions are indexed according to the legislation in force every year from 1 April, taking into account the rate of increase in the subsistence level of a pensioner in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The draft law introduced in the lower house provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions to take into account the rate of increase in consumer prices.
The first indexation is postponed to 1 February and the second is held on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA stated to Mogerini that it was unacceptable to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Federica Moguerini, OSCE Speaker Ilkka Canerva stated that sanctions against legislators participating in Assembly events were unacceptable.
This was reported to the journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar, Nikolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, the signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Cyprus, Cyprus, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, have been collected in support of Canerva's position.
"A fairly strong support has already formed," Kovalev said.
He had previously stated that the head of the OSCE PA had intended to collect signatures from deputies, who had pointed out that sanctions against parliamentarians should not be imposed.
In particular, Kovalev noted that Canerva had promised to raise the issue to the level of EU governance and to “send a petition”.
NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Cape islands is 60%.
A broad low-pressure front about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the islands of the Green Cape is likely to turn 60 percent into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, reported the U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday.
Another clearly defined area of low pressure around the middle between the islands of Green Cape and the Small Antilles also has a 60 per cent probability of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reports synoptics from Miami.
Google is launching a double-donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced the launch of a double-donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping European refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google used an uncharacteristical personal approach, announcing a fundraising campaign on its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, Google staff member Rita Masood, who had fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We got on questionable trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has worsened, many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
Donations will be made to four non-profit organizations involved in refugee and migrant assistance: Médecins sans frontières, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million in donations until the amount on the google.com/refugueerelief page reached $11 million.
Europe confronts the worst refugee crisis since World War II, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Obesity surgery can help diabetics with slight obesity
The beneficial effect after surgery of obesity in people with small obesity, type 2 diabetes, can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetics with slight obesity live longer after obese surgery than those receiving non-surgery treatment.
"Death statistics aren't immediately visible," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery, who wrote about a new study in the JAMA Surgery editor's column.
Obese surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organizsians to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved to be effective in treating Type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morphide obesity with a body mass index (MIT) of 35 or higher.
The IMT, a measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal at 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above shows that a person has excessive weight, and people with IMTs above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypassing and sleeve gastroectomy, with the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in people with slight obesity.
The average IMT for those who were surgically involved dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year of study.
At the same time, IMTs for those who received non-surgery treatment for diabetes remain at around 29.
Of those who had undergone the operation, 36 per cent had been completely cured of diabetes and 28 per cent had been partially cured.
In the group receiving medication, by comparison, only 1 per cent had a complete cure for diabetes and only about 2 per cent had a partial cure for diabetes.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LNP cholesterol were generally better in the surgical group," the authors state.
Researchers also monitored levels of A1s hemoglobin in blood, which reflected levels of blood sugar in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better held below 7%, written by researchers.
After surgery, average A1c hemoglobin decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at about 8%.
But the best glychemic control indicators, reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Cheng Soo, research manager, and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared to the band that had had a sleeve gastroectomy, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg), achieved a greater decline in the IMT (7.4 vs. 5.1) and in the hemoglobin A1s (3.1 % vs. 2.1 per cent) and was closer to complete remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent vs. 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not show the advantages of the surgical method in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to longer life expectancy, as Blackstone reports from the College of Medicine in Phoenix, Arizona University.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who chose bariatric intervention, the probability of dying for 15 years was about 29 per cent lower than the group in which more traditional methods were used.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encouraged people with an IMT below 35 interested in such a procedure.
“This report is very important because it states that such surgery is safe in a group with low IMTs where there is no increased risk of death or renal disease”, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient's IMT falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to get people to take it seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they build up the genetic changes that drive obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it's very difficult to reverse it.
In Mouses, the robbers carried out coats and 9 million rubles from the house.
In Mouses, robbers attacked residents of the Moscow house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's coats from them.
Interfax informs this by referring to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unknowns entered through an open front door a house located on Gorkoi Street, tied the 20-year-old son of the housewife and threatened both with a knife, stealing 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million,265,000 roubles, and criminal proceedings were initiated under the heading “Scatter”.
European fans risk becoming homeless.
Only 23 peterburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to see the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are not in a hurry to obtain a permit.
In the opinion of the experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to world championship, the authorities will have to come up with an urgent way to settle all the city's guests.
Rosbalta interviewers believe that the cost of renting rented apartments will increase by 10-30 per cent due to the tournament, and will have to be overpaid after the championship.
The World Football Championships led the authorities to draw attention to the condition of Russian hotels.
Under the law, written specifically for first place, every hotel in Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the stated number of stars and level of service.
It is already clear that this will not be possible for all: hotels are so afraid of checks that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Petersburg.
According to UFAS head Vadim Vladimirov, the agency has studied 138 hotels and now plans to file 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to the anti-monopolists.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived citizens by placing a number of stars in advertising, noted Vladimirov.
The problem is, right now, there's literally every number, no one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will occupy all peterburg hotels.
In the city now, tourists can count on 30,500 rooms.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two-star and three-star hotels, and 550 single-star hotels.
According to the First Deputy Tourism Development Committee, Nana Gwichia has so far been classified as only 23 hotels - so many checks have been carried out by accredited companies in Petersburg.
But did any hotel order a similar procedure from regional enterprises, which are not known for their surprising circumstances?
So there may be more classified, but no one knows about it.
"The last six months of hotels have not been very keen on classification," admitted the director of the Northwest branch of the Russian Tourin Industry Union, Catherine Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season during which hotels earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is that the budgets did not include the cost of the checks, and the procedure may cost the hotel, depending on the status of 30,000 to 100,000 rubles or more.
However, in recent times hotel managers have intensified and begun to apply for classification, assuring Shadskaya.
Hotels have to make it to July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay the fine, but will not be allowed to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that depending on starship, a fixed hotel room fee will be developed during the tournament.
The formulas by which the cost will be calculated will be released next year.
This is done to prevent the 200-300 per cent price rise, as is the case, for example, during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience, and you don't want a promotion two or three times, but you have to let hotels make a living.
"I think it's going to be up to 50%," explained the president of the Russian hotel association Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixing is consistent with an understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much this fits within the framework of economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's better than unbridled worth," he said.
It's not clear what's going to happen to the popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the State have introduced a bill according to which hostels are to be banned in homes.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not apply to Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved," says Nana Gwacia.
However, she said that the owners of the mini hotels should in any event be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the State Duma did approve the bill, about 80 per cent of hostels would be closed in Petersburg, and at present there were 1.5 thousand rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hotelers of Northwest Leonid Garbar, Petersburg lacks two- and three-star hotels that are precisely sought by football fans, but there is a bias towards hotels with four and five stars.
This state of affairs is similar to the situation where "75,000 vips sit in the 80 thousandth stadium".
This can be fixed just by mini hotels.
Their possible ban is considered by an expert to be "idiotism": "I find it strange that some people can live in apartments, but those who come here can't."
If the hostel is used as a dormitory, I agree it's wrong.
But if it's like a hotel that guests come to for a short time, why not?
Mini-guests risk skipping the World Cup and due to their slowness.
Hundreds of small hotels just won't be able to get classified, and the hole digs itself.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordering jobs.
"Companies that can run this procedure are not many, so they will give up less-paid orders from mini hotels, but will choose those that are more expensive," said Gennady Lumshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the rates of checks that have been made are now much higher than those of Petersburg.
The reason for the Peterburg delay is also related to the constant changes in the Government ' s tourist unit, which does not facilitate the smooth operation.
According to experts, if the peterburg hotels are not enough for everyone, it is likely that attention will have to be paid to regional hotels and rest homes.
Following the example of the 300th anniversary of Petersburg, the river fleet can be mobilized into the city, i.e. guests of the tournament can reside in cabins.
In addition, many fans are trained to come in vans that can sleep in.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that then they're empty," I'm sure Gennady Lumshin.
There will also be a high popularity of rental housing during the football championship.
The most likely place in the city will be a reserve of rented apartments.
The rent rate will increase by 10 to 30 per cent.
"From the obvious, housing near the stadium will be the first to leave," noted the development and real estate contractor Laris Bragin.
The rental price may not return to its previous level after the championship, especially in the bedroom areas.
The construction of new traffic interchanges on the outskirts of the city would also contribute to this, she stressed.
We should not forget the human qualities of our citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people not only point the way, but can also conduct a mini tour.
There are complications.
My father met a family from Murmansk in 1970, a father, a mother, and two children.
They didn't have a place to sleep, so it was hard to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to bed," the interlocutor recalled.
True, he added that there was no such trait left in the city today - calling in your home has consequences and fear.
But maybe in 2018, after the failure of the State's decision, the mistakes of hotels and governments, we'll have to remember what happened.
Girinovsky "sill" Amur Oblast.
I admired Girinovsky's clown in the State Duma today.
He did these things when our generation was just learning how to sell newspapers, and he's still in great shape.
The theme of the speech is, like, the LDDP protest against the election results in the Amur region.
The protocols do not shake - for nothing; the LDDP does not seem to have any protocols other than those signed by the buffalo.
Here he picks up the second-placed Ivan Abramov and shouts something like, "Here's the winner of the election!"
And then he throws himself at Rodney, and then, after a fight with the presiding officer, he takes the faction out of the conference room, screaming literally, "You're all with the fronts of your cons and thieves."
The press naturally focuses not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
Really Wolfovich prettyly and elegantly leaked the Amur Oblast along with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another Girinovsky-style act of "docks!", not a political party protest against the results of specific elections.
Both the faction formally chanted, and the election, according to the party's website and Facebook by Ivan Abramov, is not recognized, but the leader is clearly off the subject.
He gives the dead on Amura to bury their own dead, and he himself gives the good news against "One Russia" in general and innocent Rodney.
It's a fine decision, so you don't lose your face, and you don't have to go into a real scandal, not a show scandal.
Another thing is that Abramov himself is now in a strange position.
He couldn't wait to hear anything but shout from his superiors, and there are no alternative protocols on his hands.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but, on the other hand, for the narrow circle, he has become the formal reason for both insulting the respected champion and, even more so, the Ham attacks against the ER and the ONF.
And then, of course, he has to really think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the election, politics number 2 of the region, and candidate number 1 of the only district single-member district, he can become a pariah that has been successfully used by its own party leadership and super irritant for that very ONF and the party leadership of a stranger.
I'm sure it wouldn't have been Zhirinovsky, but he should've been thought of and respected.
The tram to him is still growing and growing.
There was news that the LDDP would return to the hall during the next POW.
I mean, the bath fell out of nowhere.
The only thing that's happened to Abramova is that she's buried it.
It's really beautiful.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in the countries of origin of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the continuing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Center at Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
In the circumstances, he said, the interests of humanity should be higher than those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama commended Germany and Austria for their response to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"The care of thousands of refugees is fine, but at the same time you must also think about lasting solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries," he stressed.
After all, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US's tough reaction had launched a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a solution to this problem could be achieved through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and that caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed hand disinfectants over the past 4 years
Toxicological centres in the United States have reported an almost 400 per cent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who have absorbed a high-alcohol hand sanitizer since 2010, according to Georgia State Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia State Toxicology Center, cases of children ingestion of fluids for hand disinfection reported to toxicological centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"Children contact these substances more frequently, and unfortunately some percentage goes to the emergency room," said López CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant fluid on purpose, and some do so to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking disinfectant fluid as cheap drinks.
Teenagers reportedly mixed disinfectant fluid with alcohol-containing mouthwashing fluid to obtain a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smell of disinfectant fluid.
"The kid doesn't think it could hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (sanitizing fluids for the hands) are those that are scented.
There are disinfectant fluids for hands that smell strawberries, grapes, oranges that are very attractive to children.
The decontamination fluid for the hands contains about 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's high-concentration alcohol," told Fox 4 in Kansas City Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician of the toxicology centre at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave a glass of whiskey, but people keep these hand disinfectants in plain sight, and if kids get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed an anti-sanitizer at school with a strawberry scent of about four sprays, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija confused the words and could not walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
The doctors watched her all night at a separate children's clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain trauma, as the girl fell and hit her head due to alcohol, told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," told CNN by Orthoria Scott, Naiji's mother.
It might well have been fatal for my baby.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-spiritants or disinfectant napkins, in addition to removing disinfectant fluids for their hands from the reach of the children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, not ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-graders in northern New York conspired to poison their "opposite" teacher by "dissemination of antibacterials in the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher has a severe allergy to hand disinfectors, and she banned them from her class.
Police believe the failed plan was "empty talk" and addresses discipline issues to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul, it became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the N.K. Krupska Children's Library, the iron owl is saddened.
The little ones who come for the books are trying to feed her candy.
For several generations he has been going to this library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twentieth years of the last century performed loud readings, performances on Mayakovsky's poems, literary quizzes, and correspondence with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the newspaper Young Stalinist wrote in 1939, each day "the friendship between Hope Constantine Krup and friends of the Children's Library of Barnaul" grew stronger.
Hope Konstantinovna even sent a picture of her child once to distant Barnaul friends.
And when the Barnauls asked if Hope Constantine objected to the library being given her name, she wrote that she didn't, she didn't.
Letters have long been burning in the museum, and first-read grandchildren and great-grandsons have to explain whose harsh profile decorates the barelef on the library building.
During the restructuring years, there were many calls from different people, outraged: Why is the children's library not renamed?
Let's have a library of some good children's writer's name without political color!
The staff of the library sat down, thought, and decided to leave it as it was.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul as "Leninka" in Moscow.
There's a yellow brick track on the floor in the library lobby.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is the favorite theme of artist Oli Moskovka.
Olja used to be a law manager, came to work at 8:00, left at 5:00, and all the other managers were different only from the love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet saying, "Illustration's required for the book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mom has cancer."
Olya made illustrations, and thought that life could end at any moment, and there would be no miracles in it unless you created them yourself.
She now works in the library, illustrates children's books from writers around the world, and writes fairy tales herself.
Traditionally, it is believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But there are children who read to us and their parents understand the meaning of reading, says The Russian Planet, director of the Tatiana Kushvid Library.
In recent years, we've even had such a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and it's going to live - the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
There's a big exhibition stained glass in the library lobby with an updated photo exposition.
Once a quarter, new photographs are posted of readers who go to the library by their entire family: Mom, Dad, and children.
The library is glad that more and more popes are coming with the children.
If at two years of age the child was read all of Chukovsky, at an older age he needs books more complicated.
But there is now a law that prohibits an eight-year-old prodigy from issuing 12+ books.
To get a book like this, a kid has to bring his parents with him - they come back, then they come back again, and gradually, "Krupskaya" becomes some kind of family club for them.
There are treasures in the library - a pre-revolutionary collection of venoms and eres, to lead Korolenko in an app to Niva magazine, a 1936 Murzilki app.
Because we're not just the conceptual space of the book's temple, we're open to motion, we're trying to be a special place: not home, not work, not school, Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play, draw together.
We've made a play zone for the little ones - the baby just comes to play, and the hand still reaches for the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they stick their feet around, and they don't want to leave.
Mothers with wheelchairs often come in, and we're glad they put the library first among all the other places to come with the babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says modern children like we once loved classical children's literature:
"The publishing business is now evolving, and much attention is being paid to authors who are a link between generations".
And speaking of little babies, it's important that there be some hero who travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library constantly produces booklets for parents, which show what is going on in contemporary children's literature, what books to look at, and why.
The booklets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library isn't for them.
It is forbidden for adults to carry books outside the reading room.
Only children have this magical privilege.
...There's a square hatch in the library's farthest room with an ancient wooden stairway in the basement, in the bookstore.
The steps will be squeaking under your feet - it's a very old time machine.
You're dating your childhood book like an old friend: hey, good thing you and I don't change.
Ally's still walking along the road paved with yellow brick, lazy Tol Reds stealing magic matches, and Malchish-Kibalchish never told the damn Bourgeins of the War Mystery - that's a hard word.
Books like passwords, you can recognize your own anywhere.
There's also real book rarity in the vault - like the pre-revolutionary collection was with yarns and eres.
Or take Corolenko to the famous Niva magazine app.
Or the 1936 Murzilki Apportion.
Time aged the pages, painted them in tea color.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
These are the pieces of our future collection, and I always dream of retiring and taking care of rare children's books.
But the kids aren't going to fall for it, so to speak, and the paints in the old books aren't very bright, and the topics... you open the front page, and there's Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now it's like, why were we all writing this Pioneer Truth?
But still it was interesting,' says "The Russian Planet" by Galina Ilasov, who runs the book store.
The Murzilk pages are darker from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna runs a book store her entire life.
She knows the color of the cap at Buratino, in which school year Harry Potter became captain of Gryffindor's team at the Quidditch Championship, in which situations Carlson uses a silencer for a motor, and who Alice's father Selezzeva works.
The librarian is paid little for his work, and anyone who can live without these book rows very quickly finds another profession.
The only ones that remain are the most convinced: educators, teachers, ministers of the book.
You can also recognize them from a smile - it's believed to be a professional trait of a child librarian.
If he smiled at you at the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I love children's books at all: how a librarian likes them to be, to stand upright and beautiful on shelves, and I also love to read them, ” says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical storytelling, fairy tales, fiction.
Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think things were different when I was a kid.
The books were the most interesting and exciting thing that ever happened to me.
And since I loved them madly, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be in spite of the Riders.
And I rejoice when our former readers bring children, or even grandchildren...
There's no disagreement at Celtic.
Griffiths denied talking about the Celtic disagreement after acknowledging Dale that Hoops is in a bad position, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim to Neilson, and Warburton fears signing contracts in January that could disrupt team unity
Dons increased the advantage over Celtic to five points.
Adam Rooney's first half penalty gave Aberdeen a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodri, allowing Dons to break off Celtic by five points.
Griffiths denied talking about disagreements.
This gave rise to rumours of disagreements in Celtic, which were stopped by Griffiths, who stated that he and his teammates were not suffering from any heightened criticism in preparation for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots aren't in the race for the title - de Boer.
Former Rangers quarterback and former Dutch team member Ronald de Boer stated that Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celtic because he was not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently a representative of Ajaxa, said, "The Dutch no longer show the most attractive moments of Celtic games, why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about bringing the Rangers back.
They're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in Old Firm games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," Dale said.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Celtic was in trouble, but the Norwegian coach vowed to change everything.
The defeat from Malmö and, as a result, the withdrawal from the Champions League was soon followed by a loss to 10 Aberdeen footballers, who now, having lost five points, is at the top of the table.
However, Dale stated, "Selica had bad periods before, and we'll go out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I realize it's very frustrating, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And so do we, but we need to keep going.
And we really, really need Celtic's support because that makes the players much better.
Staying together is so important right now.
Warburton with distrust awaits January transfers
Despite opinions just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he identified some of the objectives of the January transfers, Ranger boss Mark Warburton is distrustful of the January campaign, claiming that he does not want to destroy the team's unity.
Brentford's former attacker stated, "January transfer window is very different from summer window."
As for the players that come in the summer, you have a period before the season to adapt them, which is what you saw in our own group this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Michoo, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at his retirement.
Swansea Meach's attacker, linked to Celtic during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with the Swans was completed.
A 29-year-old player suffered from ankle problems for two years, and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Harts are going to confront SFA about Neilson's statements.
Harts ran 2–1 when Paterson was removed and lost 3–2, but the red card of the defender was later cancelled; this is the third red Collum card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not retract his words, saying, "I did not question ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tyncastle.
The hardball player of the Hibernian team received a reprimand after admitting to singing a song with offensive words about former Harts player Rudy Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in Roseburn District in Edinburgh before the beginning of the Edinburgh Derby on Tyncastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was hot," stated the attacker, adding, "I can safely say I wasn't going back to Tyncastle if he didn't play for Celtic."
Donnelly: Tannadis Council is confident in the management of Dundee United
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundee United's board of directors remains confident that the management team will make a difference, but agrees that the deterioration of the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys ready to go out again," said Donnelly.
McInnes is glad that "unpretty" won from Hamilton.
Derek McInness admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assis to win the league's seventh consecutive victory, which put them five points above Celtic, upstairs of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInness said, "There's no team here that would win anything-- a cup, or a league championship that didn't win a meeting like this."
The unemployment rate among Scots does not change, whereas in the United Kingdom as a whole it is increasing
THE number of unemployed in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher than the rate in the United Kingdom of 5.5 per cent, as shown by figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with 2,612,000 currently employed.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74.0 per cent in a quarter, above the United Kingdom average of 73.5 per cent.
Scottish Minister David Mandela, commenting on the most recent figures, noted: "The government's long-term plan laid the foundations for strengthening the economy".
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made its historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market, with rising employment and declining unemployment.
Why am I witness execution in Oklahoma?
Today, by avoiding legal interference at a later stage, I will watch a man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll sit on the death row galleries in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is executed with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
This request was first made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day approached, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more people than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'll be sitting with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we have our own relationship after a few months of phone calls and one visit lasting two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of tweeting about my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she could have made a better statement herself, but still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with something I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't even do it if he did.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he died, he believed that publicity would help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, the reporter from Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I wrote down.
I'm not going to go into the details here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip wasn't responsible.
His actions after Barry van Treese's murder make him guilty of aiding and abetting a crime.
But I believe there's a great chance he's innocent of murder.
I'm pretty sure there wasn't enough evidence for a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll watch him die.
I can't say I'll be completely objective.
There will be other reporters who can be contacted.
You'll learn from me what it's like to watch a man I like die without having to.
The man being chased by the police was persuaded to get out of the Canning River.
A constable from the town of Canning Vale managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River and to stay dry himself.
Perth's resident intended to leave the police, but failed to get stuck in dirty water in shallow waters a few metres from a police officer trying to "sweetly persuade him to go ashore."
Canning-Vail Police were called on Tuesday for illegal entry into foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them by throwing himself at Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I won't go out, come on, grab me," said Sgt. Chandell Castlestein.
Constable Lachlan Perhavetz didn't really want to wet the uniform, so he used a safer reception-- "negotiation with a good cop."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," says Sgt. Castledine.
That's exactly what the champion footballer Ben Kazinz remembered.
In 2006, Cazins moved to the ditch to avoid meeting with a police patrol to test for alcohol, and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts proved to be in vain, but encouraged locals to invent a funny "beatlon Ben Cazins".
Peter Moody accuses stewards of attempting espionage and threatens to withdraw from horse sports
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria of attempting to introduce a spy into his stable last year and threatened to immediately abandon horse sports.
He was targeted by stewards and ethics officers of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of having campaigned personally against him, and the withdrawal from the start of Lady Tatai due to the violation of the rules for the use of drugs on the day of the start, Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always made every effort to participate in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of Lidari's trial on a cobalt, which he can't explain.
He held his tongue about the suspicion of espionage for a year and a half and didn't want it to "look like green grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've endured it for a long time, but sometimes it gets you so out of line that you can't contain yourself anymore," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep tight.
I want to walk with my head high, and I want my owners to know that I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking it's not, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Moody previously stated sensationally during an interview at Racing.com that the ethics department had tried to spy in his stable.
"A year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I would call if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to convey information about what I was doing in my stable," Moody said at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If so, they should certainly all apply, as they failed to catch me.
Robert Ralston, former RVL chairman, David Moody, current RVL chairman, and Bernard Sondry, the incumbent RVL executive director, knew about this all the time and now know.
Shouldn't it make me think it's getting personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to hold accountable for what's going on in this business, people other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I so bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think that's what it is.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I'm sure what I'm saying can make them think about it.
But I've come to a point where I don't care, and it saddens me.
It makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and hold them responsible for their decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
Coach's frustration only grew during a long investigation into the cobalt and Lidari incident, and the last withdrawal of the horse from the start made him state that he could "pull his license on the table."
Moody, best known for preparing the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of medications on the day of the competition "a laughable" after a horse was compressed with clay on its feet, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a race violation.
"I must take full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my employees accidentally made a compress on her leg.
She could've got the compress last night.
She could've got it yesterday, just like she did.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody can be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medication on the day of the compress competition, on which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far," Moody said.
A driver who hit and fled the Cobram incident was arrested
Police arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobram on the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old in the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with abandoning the place of the incident, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic regulations.
A motorcyclist, a 40-year-old Cobram resident, remains in stable condition in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is partaking of the rivals' allegations of harsh force tactics.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called his team's criticism of the ball interception as "the binding of the agenda" by two NRL championship favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson stated that the judges allowed Storm to "fight" with his team during Storm's sudden victory in the Sydney qualifying game final on Friday night.
Coach Brisbane Broncos Wayne Bennett made a clear hint at Storm after his team won the final of the qualifying tournament from the Nostern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called this game "typical" for the rugby league and stated that the two of Queensland's team were not "too successful" in the hand-to-hand fight.
Bellamy defended the ball interception by his team and stated that they were just focusing on "contact" intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was embroiled with the confidence of two leading coaches to criticize his team, as it meant that they were concerned about a possible defeat from Storm.
"It keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about tough moves when they beat us with a 24–2 score," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything for a year in our defense systems or techniques, just in the last six weeks, we've paid special attention to the contacts in the ball interception, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always manifests at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that St George-Illavarre Dragons Bennett won the championship in 2010, showing "sick" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized for calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It's a football you'd like to play when you have players like that.
He made this remark in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play that way.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that Storm and Rusters were a contest with more points than Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen her yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is this impressive football?
Or do you think that breaks and failed attempts are impressive?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means at some point we can meet them there.
Storm's at the end of the week off, as they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronalla Sharks next Saturday night at the preliminary final at AAMI Park Stadium, the tickets will be available for sale next Tuesday morning.
A drug-depositing Serb released on $200,000 bail.
A man who was facing life imprisonment for attempting to embezzle 40 kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released on $200,000 bail.
Marco Maximovich, 29, is one of the five people arrested last month after federal police discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on Solay's yacht, coming from South America via Vanuatu and mooring in Coomer in August.
Throughout the morning, Maximovich and his associates were seen at the marina, and later he met with them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo's car.
Although Maksimović faces a life sentence for attempting to divert sufficient quantities of drugs for sale, Maksimović's lawyer claims that there is no evidence that the latter tried to obtain the entire shipment, and that the man could have been in the cafe without intent.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has connections with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maximovich's mother and stepfather were offered a joint bond of $200,000 for his release.
"From the testimony of both, it becomes clear that the sum of $200,000 bail is too much of a financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan remarked.
But this measure alone is not enough as a guarantee that it will not disappear, added the judge.
Maximović was allowed to be released on bail on condition that he surrenders his both Australian and Serbian passport, is reported to the police daily and observe a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katzikaris: "I'm sorry for Greece's team that fought until the last seconds."
Greece's head coach, Fotis Katzicaris, paid tribute to his team after the Eurobasket 2015 final match 1/4 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game had resolved some mistakes.
It was a big game,' quotes AFP Caticaris.
We were preparing for a great Spanish game.
Tried to work for the defense, but defence mistakes determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "In CSKA, I will be assigned Kauna functions".
CSKA rookie Joel Freeland stated that he did not believe in the curse of the Army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I talked to Coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, quotes Freeland's R Sport.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to rebuild the center position, but in the NBA, I was more of a forward.
Now, you're gonna have to confront a big center rival more than that, but I've done it before, so I think I'm gonna do it now.
The Army won the Euroleague the last time in 2008.
Since then, they've reached Final Four six times, but they couldn't show their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling the team's been jinxed.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's complicated, I understand all the frustration of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we do the best we can, we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague, I really think so.
I've always wanted to win this title, the Moskwichs have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSKA.
As for the glare, I'm not superstitious and I don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, everything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "To me, the match with Roma will be special."
The head coach of Barcelona, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the first round of the Champions League's Group Tour with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the face-to-face fight of his current and former team would not become a private for him.
Let us recall that Luis Enrique trained "wolfs" in the 2011–12 season, but failed to prove himself best in Italy's capital.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I gained some experience.
I have very warm memories of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The important thing is to start the Champions League with a win.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamber Cup will not affect team action in the next match.
I expect from Roma the game she showed in series A against Juventus.
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Scripchenko: Krasnodar has various options for attacking."
Acting head coach of Ural Vadim Skripchenko, in the run-up to the 9th Premier League match with Krasnodar, noted the variety of attacking schemes of the rival team.
According to the mentor, the bulls have several models of assault in their arsenal.
The fight will take place on 21 September and begin at 4.30 Moscow time.
How do we play with Krasnodar, let's see, the official Urala website quotes Scripchenko's words.
We've got a whole week of training ahead of us.
This team has different options for attacking, conducts their attacks in many ways, and we're not a slow team, so I think there's going to be a very interesting game.
In anticipation of this game, given that Krasnodar is hosting a European League match against the Dortmund Borussia, we will try to prepare ourselves very well to win.
Roher Kanyas: "Astana House can take points from anyone."
Astana quarterback Roher Kanyas, after the first round of the Champions League's Group tournament with Benfica (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
According to Havbek, in their field, the Astanans are capable of taking points from any rival.
Despite the fact that the match was hard for us, I can say that we played well, - cites UEFA's official website Kañas's words.
Benfica's above class, but in a home match, I think we can count on taking away their glasses.
It's pretty real.
But first we have to think about Galatasaray and then Atlético.
In home matches, we can take points from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "I repeat all the times: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Reala head coach Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with a major win in the first round of the Champions League's Group tournament with Shachter (4:0).
A specialist paid tribute to forward Cristian Ronald, who became the author of three goals.
The match was not easy because the Shahter can own the ball, cites the official UEFA website of Benitez's words.
The opponent did not have many moments, but their counterattacks are always dangerous.
I can't say Real was perfect, but we had plenty of goal opportunities.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll repeat it all the time.
Jordy Alba: "Cristiano Ronaldo cannot match Messi".
Barcelona's defender Jordy Alba believes that no one can match his one-club Lionel Messi.
According to the Spanish, the Reala forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, can't do that either.
Messi is five goals above the rest,' quotes Le Figaro Alba.
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
Things are changing with Leo on the field, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: "Barcelona" has not only unique style, but also bright identities.
Roma quarterback Daniele De Rossi, on the eve of the Champions League Group Tournament match with Barcelona, noted the importance of compactness and insurance in playing with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
Let's remind you, C.E.'s going to broadcast it.
Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players, quotes UEFA's official website De Rossi.
It's hard to play with blue granite because they have not only unique styles, but also bright identities.
To keep them, we'll have to work all the way through the match and keep each other safe.
Messi is almost always successful when she goes round, so we need to stay compact and organized.
Jezov hopes to enter SKA's starting squad in a match with Slovan.
Golkiper SKA Ilya Yezhov stressed that he hoped to enter the Army's starting squad in the next KHL Championship match.
Jezov went to the ice instead of Mikko Koskinen in the 23rd minute at the score of 0–3 and reflected all the shots on his gate, the fourth SKA goal missed after replacing the goalkeeper with the sixth field player.
The next match the team will be away against Slovan.
I hope I get out in the next start-up match, says "R-Sport" Jezov's words.
I'm not an expert on goalkeepers, I'm a goalkeeper, we don't have repeats of missed heads, so it's hard to trace.
Dinamo played well, everybody has bad matches.
The team still lost.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.

Stevean Hogg used the girl's phone to force pedophiles to send pictures.
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to solicit images of child abuse.
Stevean Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered with the internet messaging service, where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found her phone missing and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked him out and found shocking pictures, after which she immediately drew the attention of her mother.
Police arrived and saw five images, after which they examined the computers found at this address and found "relevant" queries in the search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done it because it might have been "attempting pedophiles" and then he would have "pretending to be a cop to scare them."
The court officer, Eileed Robertson, told the sheriff's court in Dundee, "He stated that it was an addiction, he became addicted to scaring people.
He admitted to making requests on the computer, but stated that it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare pedophiles.
He was questioned about talking to an unknown person who sent him images and about asking him to send more pictures.
He said he was doing it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking, and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added, "When the girl found the photos on the phone, she called her mother, shivering and crying.
She saw obscene images on the phone, and then a face-to-face bet was held with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused had used a computer and Plaistion to speak to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charges of making indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating bail on 25 January this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, requested that Hogg not be listed as a sex offender, as it can be shown that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed his sentence until October, pending receipt of the social services reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was taken into custody prior to the hearing of the other remaining cases.
He was listed as having committed sexual offences before the date of sentencing.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe reads the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest state leader, fell down the stairs leading from the podium earlier this year.
It was unharmed, but the video with the fall scene immediately spread through social media.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by statements by parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats warning them against whistling Mugabe during the speech.
A month ago, they whistled on the president during his address to the nation in Parliament; it was Mugabe who repeated that speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a Member of Parliament for the Movement for Democratic Change, stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is called Death," he told journalists at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned the noted members of Parliament that immunity ended in the Parliament building and that parliamentary immunity did not work as soon as they left.
A Member of Parliament stated that the party led by Morgan Tswangirai was “disturbed” by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and reduction programme for service delivery.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the faster-growing hardware and service sectors.
The deductions resulting from the anticipated job cuts would be approximately $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, as stated in the Hewlett-Packard statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard at present, and business portfolio will be wider and deeper to help the company move to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of over $50 billion and "will focus on providing previously unachievable complex technological solutions" to companies, reported in the company's statement.
This divides the company formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley."
Hewlett Packard is in the process of undergoing a major reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world's second personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in the United States, is the latest development in this sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies are doing better.
Arsenal captain Michel Arteta says his one-clubs should support injured Jack Wilshire before playing with Dinamo Zagreb.
In a conversation with Wilshire, Wenger also stressed that it was not until September, and that, provided that Wilshire's recovery went according to plan, nothing would prevent him from returning to the game by Christmas.
With the most favourable developments, Wilshire will definitely miss at least four further games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The most unfortunate part of this recent problem is that Wilshire confidently ended the previous season with the only ankle injury and was about to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during preseason training.
Wenger: "This injury doesn't threaten his career."
It's just not a fully healed bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not about the ankles or the injuries he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but, as Hungarian also allowed, there is a attendant risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavourable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire recorded 23 different injuries to him in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal scenario more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting in 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs most missed out due to day injuries.
Hungarian recognizes the possibility of being stuck in a vicious circle, but in Arsenal, they believe that improvements in injury statistics will continue in the last season.
"Sometimes when you're back in service after an injury, you've been vulnerable for a while -- during that time you need to regain strength and gain a competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he recovers physically, I'm sure, as well as his career will be what he deserves.
Arsenal starts a campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday in a match with Dinamo Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with Chelsea and on the next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the composition.
Héctor Belierin and Aaron Ramsey did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Mathieu Debushi and Arteta will play in the starting lineup.
It is possible that Wenger will also join Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giro instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Wolcott.
"I'm trying to keep balance and give a little break to those players who need it," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favorite in Group F, Maxim Stadium in Zagreb is among the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo hasn't lost a single of 41 games since they managed to spend the last season as Invincible.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was exposed to an earthquake with a strength of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal learned the lesson learned last season when the team was defeated in the Monaco Champions League game, and remains with a weak hope of leading the club to a win in the Champions Cup final.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger remarked.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm a realist with a long history.
We have ambition, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons in male friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially considering how desperate men's need for honesty has become now more than ever, with the suicide rate among young men at the highest level in 15 years.
In 2013, this was the single largest cause of death for men between 20 and 45 years of age in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely to die than women.
In an attempt to understand the issue of the Campaign against a Poor Life, it has declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to face this challenge.
A recent study of over 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a sufficiently large number of friends "in a normal mood", the chances of cure are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends halves the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, to make friendship work, first of all, you have to have it.
In an era when communication is managed by social networks, when style prefers content, the speed of response is often more appreciated than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving fun and successful, even if there is real loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which have a greater impact on our mental health.
And as one billionaire, the video game maker, recently remarked, you can't buy more happiness for money.
The Dignity of Friends is that they draw attention to this.
Each of the characters was defined not through his work, but rather through a personality that manifested itself in communicating with friends.
Joey's humor and Chandler's constant embraces, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross' sighing on Rachel-- everything comes from understanding that men can feel it even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As Samaritens said to me, "...my role as a listener for people who feel depression and suicidal feelings underlines how even the smallest communication of friends can be beneficial."
Often, men who turn to us feel unable to speak to their friends.
The old "live with it" teaching is strong, as is the feeling that a frank conversation about problems can be perceived as weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-lasting coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the subtle moments of male friendship.
As far as my task is concerned, the status of an outsider, who talks over the phone, helps people in times of despair, and long-term support comes from close family and friends.
So, if you're going to FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where you've completely restored the decorations for the holiday, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a drink.
Or even better, if you see a lonely man at Starbucks, smile and say, "Hi."
I can't guess what good friendship can do in advance.

Di Maria scores a goal by helping the SGC defeat Malmö.
Angel de Maria celebrates scored balls at Malmö Gate on the same footing as Blaise Matthew and Edinson Cavani.
Angel de Maria, making his championship debut, scored a goal, which allowed the SGW to easily bypass Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel de Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job when Paris Saint-Germain started their game in the Champions League with a very convenient 2–0 win against Malmö at Park de Prince Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after his first game in the Champions League as a SGC player began to guide the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavani scored a goal on the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Donetsk Shachter in Group A, Paris had to start a good game against Swedish champions, as they aimed not to qualify the playoffs, but to continue a series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time was not the best decision by Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovich useless in the attack and later replace him with a field in a game against a team from his hometown and club in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or as guests in the Champions League, so to win 2–0, deliver problems to rivals and play a great role in protection is a good start, even if there are more things we'll have to do during the season," Blanc said.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I wish we'd scored one or two more balls.
Ibrahimović returned after being injured in one of the substitutes for the Paris team, bringing her a 2–2 draw in a match with the Bordo in the First League on the weekend, but he was pushed back to D Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker was noted as a player capable of bringing the SGC to a new level in Europe after being bought last month from Manchester United, and he proved why when he ran out to pass from Marco Verratti behind Malmö's defense and beautifully completed the attack by sending the ball past Johan Villand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone expected the SGCs to win a small and large victory, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs to get to this stage, having nine world-level players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two teamback midfielders, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of Nicola Jurdzic's hit, in which the ball flew past Kevin Trapp's 34th minute gate, they attacked very little.
At times, however, the SGC failed itself with unsuccessful broadcasts and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimović, who in the first half alone was unable to perform at least five attempts, and then failed to process the ball scored by Kavani immediately after the game resumed.
However, he showed himself much more able in exact pass, and this was a pass from Ibrahimovich, who, Di Maria, received the ball with a twisted punch, which went in the line to the bar past Viland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the clock mark thanks to Kavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovich had rigged the ball sent to the center of the field with the left flank Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas Malmö had about returning to the game, and only Wieland's close-range capture of the ball prevented David Louis from increasing the final score before the replacement Eskeel Lavassi did not count the goal at the end of the match.
Malme coach Age Hareyde later admitted that the PSG was a class above his team, with the Norwegian saying, "Our last game in the Champions League took place last December."
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, and that's not the level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Hail "Pari"!
It was a wonderful match with them.

The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
The White House confirmed on Tuesday in an official message that China's head Xi Jinping would arrive with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, Xi Qingping's first visit to Washington, will take place on 25 September and will be a return visit to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama will also host Xi Jinping with Peng Liuan's wife at a government lunch on the evening of the same day after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to enhance cooperation between the United States and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, as well as allow US and Chinese Presidents to deal constructively with controversial topics," the report states.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with the leaders of several leading American technology companies on his way to Washington, D.C., and then to New York to participate in the September UN General Assembly.
Obama and Xi Jingping are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged cyberspying by China and China's increasing categoricalness on the issue of the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
The hit-and-run biker at Kutuzovsky Lihach received two years of colony.
In addition, the court partially granted the victims civil claims against Denis Mirzoev in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
The Moscow Road Court handed down a verdict against Denis Mirzoev, who killed a motorcyclist on the Kutuzov Avenue in Moscow.
As reported by the Russian News Service, Mirzoev was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in a settlement colony.
He has been found guilty under the article “Breach of traffic rules and the operation of vehicles” of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
In addition, the court partially granted 1.2 million rubles of civil claims to the victims.
During the deliberations of the parties, the prosecutor requested that Mirzoev be sentenced to three years ' imprisonment and that he recover the full amount of eight million rubles from the victims.
The accident in question took place on 22 May around 3 a.m. in the vicinity of 30 Kutuzov Avenue.
The BMW vehicle, which was driving Mirzoev, crossed the oncoming lane and hit a motorcyclists standing on the side of the road.
A 1989 man died locally of injuries.
Friends of the victim on social media reported that the BMW driver was driving at a high speed and headed to the oncoming lane before the accident.
Fearing that the driver would attempt to escape responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle run from the Sparrow Mountains to the Moscow HMS Department of Internal Affairs building on Petrovka, 38.
Shortly thereafter, it was reported that the investigation following the interrogation had detained the alleged perpetrator of the accident.

More than 40 orders and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakusev, the governor of the Tyumen region, at a meeting of the regional government presidency.
Some of these related to the allocation of funds for educational and health facilities in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, funds have been allocated for the purchase of a bus for a school in Nizhnetavdin district and for the major renovation of a regional hospital in Kazan district.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the major renovation of the second floor of the therapeutic branch.
The hot and cold water supply, drainage, power grids and electrical equipment, ventilation systems, the facade of the building, the renovation of premises, a set of fire safety and energy conservation measures will be renovated.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
A second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus, chaired by the Governor, will be held in Sochi from 17 to 18 September.
The forthcoming event in Sochi and the intermediate outcome of the cooperation are described by the Honorary Consul-General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumeni Vladimir Shugl, who was part of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the tasks of the Sochi Forum?
A large-scale event in Sochi reflects the Union State's industrial policy.
It is based on fruitful cooperation between regions, important links of relations between the two States.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, are scheduled to participate in the plenary meeting.
The plenary and break-out sessions will focus on the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in implementing industrial policies, the regulatory framework and the programmes of the Federal State.
The Forum will be addressed by the Governor of the Tumen region.
I think that is evidence of successful, sustained interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of the relevant ministries and departments and Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also be present.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will be held, including from the Tumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I would add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
It was attended by more than 200 delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important cooperation treaty was signed between the Tümensk and Minsk regions.
The importance of our work is also reflected in the fact that a meeting of the permanent seminar of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus took place in Tumeni.
In addition, a delegation from the APC of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in agricultural training, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial sector.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with Vladimir Yakušev, the governor of the Tyumen region, the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus was discussed under the current difficult conditions.
The question of the supply of Belarusian agricultural equipment and the use of financial mechanisms was raised, in order to reduce the cost of machinery to the end-user.
Problems were discussed in the operation of the Belshin Tumen Chamber of Commerce and options for preventing losses.
Important issues, as investment projects must work well and yield benefits to the region.
Further deliveries of passenger and cargo equipment by the OAO "MAZ" were mentioned, and the development of the OAO "MAZ" service centre, which had been established in Tumeni on the basis of the OAO "TPAT".
The discussion also focused on the preparation of a working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of the year.
Another theme of the discussion was the finalization and signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the region of Tyumen and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promise to rise to a new level.
These questions also applied to the regional centre.
During a meeting with the city's chief of staff, Tumeni Alexander Moor, we talked about the renewal of the Tumen bus park.
About 100 buses are already breathing on the ladan, so a new batch of cars from Belarus are required to operate on gas, cleaner fuels.
Another aspect: The Tumen elevator factory cooperates with one of the leading elevator products manufacturers of the OAO Mogilevliftmash, receiving components.
In my view, this activity could become more active, given the programmes to install new elevators at the regional centre.
I would add that, as part of the consul's expanded powers, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan Oblast, Alexey Kokorin, during which discussions were held on increasing the trade and supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zaural.
A meeting with the Omsk Governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The extended consular district comprises five constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but the Tumen can be described as the district's own headquarters.
The region is a launching pad for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary General Consul.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good in that they enable many problems to be solved directly and quickly, reducing their severity and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current circumstances, it is essential not to break through while continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon is against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in film production.
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, claiming backstage that there was no need to consider the ethnic composition.
During the Sunday release of the show Project Greenlight on HBO, a well-known actor interrupted Brown as she tried to emphasize the need for alternative viewpoints on the main black heroine in the selected draft script.
"A variety is appropriate when you cast for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
"Wow, wow, well," while the Martian actor was commenting live.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers.
"I'd like participants -- no matter who's gonna be the director -- to think about the interpretation of Harmony's image they're going to follow," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who gets beaten by a white pimp.
The film's producer, Dear White People, advocated that Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancacho should be filmed; Damon was sharply opposed, saying that "in the end, we may not get what we want."
After this discussion was aired on television, social networks exploded with disapproving comments to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni was angry to say about the video, "An explanation of the essence of the diversity from Matt Damon to the only black person in the room, SO WHITE, that it hurts."
Tweet scored over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "likes."
Damon's remarks appear just when the most pressing issue on the public debate is the correct coverage of a racial theme in the media.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity throughout the country, urging legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince mentioned this movement when presenting candidates for the Album of the Year nomination at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"The albums still matter," he said.
Like books and the lives of blacks, albums still matter.
More recently, Black Lives Matter leaders issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck as to whether this group would be regarded as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the movement leaders reported.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business figures, producers and media magnates invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unknown whether the actor accepted the invitation or met the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior awards first champion
The professional climber and assistant waiter Isaac Caldiero on Monday night was the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show, taking home a $1 million prize.
On this sports show, the seventh season of which has just ended, none of the participants has yet been able to pass all stages of the track with obstacles.
In the final of the season, two contestants, Caldiero and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included climbing a rope of 75 feet in 30 seconds.
Britten performed the assignment first and met the target time, becoming the first athlete in the history of the American Ninja Warrior, having passed the exhausting stage 4, but Caldiero did the task as fast as three seconds, making him the winner.
After winning with tremendous labor, Calmiero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
"Thinking about it is incredible, I have never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac commented to journalists E! such a serious leap in my income.
And then all of a sudden... I never even imagined how it could be... the future is unknown.
Executive Producer Kent Weed met with the Hollywood Reporter journalists to talk about the final and why Britten, who was the first to pass the track, would not receive any money prize.
According to the rules, the money gets the fastest participant.
"If there are more than one finisher, the prize gets the fastest of them," said Weed.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes life, it still gets a great deal of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels bad about that.
He's happy about what he did.
He got tons of enthusiastic reviews from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was meant to lose, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
The America Ninja Warrior show will return with the eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers are quietly bypassing the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't much fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers are now ranked last in the Central Division of the American League.
Claiming only to be a hindrance, the Tigers won on Tuesday from Minnesota Twins with a score of 5-4 at Targetfield.
Twins missed a chance to cut the Houston Astros by half game and rank second in the playoffs in the number of points after the winners.
For Detroiters, even for one night, it was the return of the word to letter F, which eluded them most of the second half of the season.
"All winnings are fun, no matter how they turn out," said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
The Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon made his contribution in support of the attacks, resulting in Detroit scoring three points in the first two innings, then adding another one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start in nine exits.
"I just want to end the year with good numbers," said Simon.
Pitchers don't succeed in dropping out in every game, and that's why I want to go deeper into the game.
The designated batting Tigers Victor Martinez managed to strike three times and achieved two wounds, the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits since four hits in the game against Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well as a bat," said Osmus.
He performed well in (the quality of the batter), noticeably better in the work with the bat, and kept that quality for the game.
After getting three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance to get back in the game.
Central host Byron Buxton opened the inning with a double on the left line of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making a bow, took the first base, and the second Baseman Brian Dozier received a strikeout on a swing from Simon before his seat was taken by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy bypassed Moer, the only player in the way, before the new appointed batting Miguel Sano, who knocked out a double-run single to the left of the right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of runners not in the out and a matching wound at Ver Hagen's second base, he managed to bring Trevor Pluff's third baseman to a doubleplay batting.
It was the 27th time for a major league lead player this season when Pluff hit the ball on a double play.
After Detroit added a safety wound in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned a RBI "double" in the space between the outfielders against the closing pitcher Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player kicked Sano out after three strikes and received his fifth savve.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily unpracticed Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the injured list until the game, missing more than a month due to lumbar inflammation.
"Exactly not the start I'd like," Hughes said, "but as the game developed, I felt more comfortable and was therefore able to perform some rather good shots in the third inning."
After the first batter reached the first base, Hughes threw the single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
Walker on two outs of Wrightfielder J. D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez, who made the single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series "0 for 21" with the early men in an effective position.
Third base player Nick Castellanos followed "sing" with another wound, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to approach third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning, getting a single-out "double" from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from central batting Anthony Goose, and what became 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes, whose shots were counted, threw in the uninduced third inning points, after which he was replaced by a right-handed reliver, A. J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three wounds on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Pitcher right-handed Tigers Anibal Sanchez dropped out of the players due to the spraining of his right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed a shoulder surgery on Sanchez as early as 2007.
For Sanchez, who has been on the injury list since mid-August, a start is scheduled for Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, pitcher-left, Daniel Norris, will leave the injured list and go against Twins.
Norris, who has left the Tigers in four starts since its acquisition in exchange for pitcher-left David Price on July 30, has one win and one defeat.
He has not participated in the games since August 20 due to the sprain of the slash muscle.
Tigers and Twins will complete a series of three games at Targetfield on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play pitcher right-handed Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original of Kadyrov's complaint about the book "Molba to God" went to the South Sahel court.
The South Sahel City Court received the original appeal from President Chechnya's spokesman Ramzan Kadyrov against the decision to recognize the "extremist material" of the book "Molba to God: Its meaning and place in Islam", reports Interfax, citing the chairman of the Gorsud Alexander Chuhray.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties to the trial.
Chuhrai refused to comment on the statements made by some members of the State Duma of the Russian Federation on the need to test the court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence agencies and ISIL.
"Let them themselves comment on such nonsense," he said.
On 11 September, the South Sahel City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalia Perchenko's decision to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
An appeal from the South Sahalinsk Prosecutor's Office came on Friday night.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to declare extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, not the Koranic Signs.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the judge made the wrong decision," said Chuhrai.
The decision to recognize the book as "extremist material" was taken on August 12, 2015.
In particular, quotations from the Quran were called "extremist" - "We worship you and we pray for Your help" - "Do not call on anyone besides God."
Kadyrov called the book's decision-makers "shitans and provocateurs."
Members of the State Duma were called upon to prohibit by law judicial decisions concerning the texts of sacred writings.
"I firmly believe that the State Duma should adopt a law that prohibits judicial decisions directly affecting the texts of the Koran and other divine scriptures," Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will delete comments insulting migrants and refugees
Facebook staff intends to delete posts and comments that give a negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
Facebook's leadership is working with the German Ministry of Justice to combat xenophobia and racism on the network.
For example, the previous day, the head of the department, Haiko Maas, stated that the Ministry of Justice was working with social media professionals to establish a special group of moderators.
Participants are required to monitor and remove incorrect comments on migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, it is expected that the authors of the intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for the removal of their record.
Organizations whose specialists collect complaints from social media users about offensive posts should also facilitate the rapid blocking of illegal content.
Facebook management intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative remarks against migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice was taken after xenophobic attitudes rose sharply in the German Facebook segment.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that affected the European Union countries some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all refugee shelters are already overcrowded.
The day before, the authorities had decided to temporarily settle migrants on the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Internally displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
Moscow cemeteries will have areas for relaxation.
In the near future, several metropolitan cemeteries will provide specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
The first will be Butovski, Domodedovsky, and Shcherbin Cemetery.
The first area for psychological rest has already appeared at the Troekurovsky Cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar plots will appear in other parts of the city.
This portal was told by Artem Ekimov, the head of the Ritual State Budget Institution.
Relaxation zones will represent small green areas resembling parks.
According to experts, in such “coals”, visitors to cemeteries will be able to rest, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, areas for relaxation will be built in Domodedovsk, Butovsk and Shcherbin Cemeteries and then in other parts of the capital.
According to the head of the Ritual GBW, if there is a need to expand the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest areas to the maximum extent possible.
The green stands will serve as a living fence that will separate the rest areas and the squares directly to burial sites.
The Ritual experts also announced their intention to make a proposal for the removal of fences at burial sites.
The new cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the Ritual Office of the Public Prosecutor has indicated a willingness to install electronic terminals that will enable visitors to recognize GPS coordinates and burial plates.
In June of this year, Ritual also proposed that the cost of disposal services should be adjusted according to the time of the year.
So, digging graves in summertime will cost a thousand rubles less, in the winter, when the earth is cold.
Note that over the past year, the cost of all ritual services has been at an average cost of 10 per cent.
Five days later, a lost fungus was found in the forests of the United Kingdom.
The elderly man was alive, although he spent more than a hundred hours in the woods without provisions.
The discovery of the mountain flurry was achieved through the joint efforts of rescue workers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "79-year-old retired from Tambovsky Oblast spent five days in the woods."
No food and no water.
He was sought by relatives, rescue workers, volunteers.
There were even movie scientists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was able to be detected after the helicopter was engaged in the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the forest for opts and picks, but did not return by the evening.
Relatives immediately sought help, and as early as the following day, rescue workers and interested residents from a nearby village were raised to search for the fungus - only about 30 people.
They were joined by a helicopter of the fire and rescue centre for the fifth day.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue unit of the Smolen County Fire and Rescue Center, said, "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
He's gone very far, completely somewhere else.
It was about 12 kilometres from the search site.
He went a long way at his age.
It's a miracle that's alive.
The fungus was taken to the central district hospital in Helsinki, unconscious, in extremely serious condition.
The doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia.
How an elderly man managed to survive after five days in the forest, doctors have no idea.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Ilinian CRS: "A patient's examination, treatment given."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all of his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition has improved this morning, and remains difficult, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich comes to Smolenschyna every year from Tambovsky Oblast.
His grandson says his grandfather went to collect mushrooms before, but never went far into the woods.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of a found fungus, said, "The forest is near the road, not really local."
I've been visiting my family for a few years.
So I went to get some mushrooms.
I guess I went a little far and got lost.
As the fungus season begins, people are regularly lost in all parts of Smolen Oblast.
There have been five similar cases in the last few days alone.
Rescuers remind us that you have to walk into the woods in bright clothes, with little food, matches, and compasses.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces behind so that we can then return.
Accidental An-2 sat on a pass in a brother's taiga.
Right on the window sits down in Siberia emergency An-2.
An emergency landing was carried out by the Krasnoyar airline Enisei 68 kilometres from Bratsk.
There were no fatalities or injuries, but the aircraft itself suffered significant damage at the landing.
An-2 was on a service flight.
He had three crew members on board, the commander, the co-pilot and the flight mechanic, reports to Interfax.
The crash plane flew along the railway-Ilimsk-Achinsk route, where the airline is based.
The plane crew has already arrived in Bratsk.
The brotherly Transport Prosecutor ' s Office, after an emergency landing, An-2 began to verify compliance with air safety legislation.
An investigative team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office travelled to the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed their aircraft with passengers due to a technical malfunction on an abandoned taser airfield in Komi.
Engines and on-board electronics failed on the liner, but the crew did the impossible.
The aircraft was manned by 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was injured in an emergency landing.
News Economy - Nobel Laureate: Globalization
The processes of globalization should have helped to reduce inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, and the income gap in the developing economies is increasing.
Eric Muskin.
To remedy this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to Erich Maskin, Chief Scientist at the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-Making of the NEU, the 2007 Nobel Prize winner in Economics.
Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization have projected great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true to a great extent," emphasizes Muskin.
For example, China and India have experienced strong growth in per capita GDP.
However, it's not as bright as that.
Globalization was expected to narrow the gap between the “poor” and the “poor” in poor countries, which was reflected in the high income inequality, or more precisely, wage inequality.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, as noted by Eric Maskin in his article “Why Global Markets Have Not Reduce Inequality in Developing Economies”, published in The World Bank Economic Review, which the NIE has translated and quoted.
Together with an economist, Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income disparities in poor countries are increasing as globalization increases, reminds the NIEs of the RES.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin identifies four levels of expertise - A and B for rich countries, C and D for poor countries.
After globalization, D experts from poor countries lack the skills to collaborate with A and B experts from rich countries.
And if level C workers from poor countries are getting their wages increased by collaborating with B staff from rich countries, then D workers are not growing or their wages are falling at all.
The net effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to the widening of the wage gap between the two professional categories in poor countries and consequently to the rising level of inequality.
Kremer and E. Muskin are offered an amazingly beautiful model, alternative to the ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fouad Aleskerov, an ordinary professor in charge of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Decision-making, head of the NEU Department of Mathematics of the NSE.
And as a powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a surge in empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, according to the scientist, the employees themselves do not have the means to do so, and it is not possible for companies to pay for their training.
Governments, international agencies, NCBs and private foundations can play a significant role in this situation, according to Maskin.
The scholar notes that the theory developed does not in any way call for a halt to the process of globalization, which has produced and is bearing fruit in the form of the growth of countries' GDP.
Derbent: the live bond of time.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, celebrates his 2000s anniversary in September.
In the holiday program, the National Culture Festival of the Dagestan Peoples and the past-style fair, the Derbent carpet exhibition and Open Temple Day, the two-hour history and music show "2000 Years in Two Hours" and the guided tour of the reconstructed Peter I Museum.
The medieval stones of Naryn-Kala fortress, the old Arab inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens, it's all come from the pages of the Thousand and One Night.
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has survived since ancient times.
Although he was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar kaganat and the Golden Ord.
The age of the eastern planks, which grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mosque, is several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian Program on Trees - Monuments of Wildlife.
The shadow of the scattered krone saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
A visitor to the mosque will be served a scented tea and will be served with Dagestan treats - honey figs, persimmons, musmoules, scones, airans and sweets.
In Derbent, for centuries, they use large samovars to pour tea at one time to numerous guests.
The inscription above the entrance to Juma Mosque says the building was built in 115 Hijra.
That is, in 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking with scale and solemnity: the arcades of domes and vaults are based on square columns and lighted by sunlight from tiny windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is the traditional fascination of Derbent's inhabitants.
The owners of the pet birds put doves in the courtyards, under the trees, in the attics.
The thrilling sight is the taking to heaven of a pack of white pigeons like the flashes of the holiday fireworks.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians closed the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
As it sailed 500 metres into the sea, this structure locked Derbent's harbour.
In 2003, Derbent's serfs were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification building.
The carpets in Derbent were weaving as early as the fifth century, and until now the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for any taste - coats of wool, cotton, or wolk of all colours and shades, with or without a thief, with complex ornaments and a bizarre border.
The construction of the city began with magals - blocks with single-story stone structures.
Over the years, the magicians have hardly changed.
Only satellite plates, air conditioners on walls, and street lights remind you that you are not in a medieval city, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, parts of a water supply built by Persians some a thousand years ago remained.
To this day, ancient springs have reached where locals are still gaining water.
Many derbens prefer regular tap water from proven historical fountains.
Derbent had one of the centres of the pottery trade.
The pouring vases, the platters, the jars, the cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of potters are still making wonderful ceramics for both practical and souvenir purposes.
During the holidays and festivals, crowds of viewers gather under a tight rope at which students from the Republican School of circus art perform.
The history of amazing and risky skill spans several centuries.
The new trend is that more and more girls can be seen among rope walkers.
The Old Derbent Museum is now operating in the premises of the former Virgin bath.
Used to be washed here by unmarried girls and brides accompanied by their friends, and now anyone who wants can see a short and dome hall, hot and cold pools that have gone past bathing supplies.
Most of Derbent's houses have hot water, but baths and couples are as popular nowadays as in the old days.
The benefits of warming up the body by ferry are written in ancient books.
After a bath, blood improves, muscles lose fatigue, and the body acquires flexibility and ease.
The "Commonwealth" festival, which takes place on the territory of Naryn Kala Fortress, is attended by ethnopods of many areas of Dagestan.
The participants in the national costumes dance, play folk tunes, perform the songs of the peoples of the Caucasus, and treat visitors with delicious home cheese.
Kyrkhlar is a burial ground for forty martyrs who have lost their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most respected complexes for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
The yellowed sarcophagi from time to time are carved from whole stone blocks and oriented, as is customary in Arabs, along the west-east axis.
The Gavril and Albert Yacubova brothers are shaving their clients in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The hairdresser's been in this place for years.
Circumstances are passed on from generation to generation.
In doing so, the Yacubov brothers can do not only traditional but also modern hair.
On one of the streets of the Old City, there was a house in which the dekabrist writer Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinski, exiled to the Caucasus, lived.
After learning Turkic and collecting ethnographic material, he described Derbent of the first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, the life and livelihood of the citizens.
Chaihana is a traditional club in the East where only tea and homemade pastries are served.
Men come here to satisfy their thirst, to hang out with their friends, and to solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not encouraged to cross the threshold of tea.
The Derbent dance ensemble "Caspius" was created three years ago, but has already taken part in events at the Republican and Russian levels.
The ensemble soloists rehearse every day, perfecting people's avar, Dargin, Tat, Armenian dances.
As the evening comes, when noise is quiet and street lights are lit, local residents sit on shops near houses with performing terraces.
Generally, Derbents discuss domestic matters.
But in the run-up to the anniversary, they increasingly recall episodes of their city's unique history, which affected the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
Domodedov had a business airport game.
The capital is experiencing a new form of learning.
Four hundred students tried to be airport employees.
To do this, Domodedov installed models of the three airlines.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also served the planes.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but in complexity it did not yield to reality.
Late flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the stairs lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
It's hell for a real airport.
For the one who settled in Domodedov's hangar, the standard set of tasks to be done by the newcomers.
There were three major airports in one hangar from around the world.
They now employ four hundred students from capital colleges and universities.
Unprecedented chance to learn everything about the internal world of the airline.
Passenger registration, aircraft service, luggage turnover - even busses on the flight field, stairs, and passenger screening were entrusted to them.
And passengers are a lot of trouble.
One's got a bad ID, the other's late for the flight, the other's filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you have to deal with it as in life, in a minimum time.
For each of these tasks, he is charged a certain amount, virtual money, as if he had been paid by the airline for the service of the flight.
"For failure to do so, they are fined," explains financial analyst Dmitri Hilko in an interview with Vesti-Moscow.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely following this.
For them, this exam is an attempt to test a new form of learning.
She's already been found a place in secondary vocational education.
“Six interregional centres of competence will be established, which will essentially become new models of the activities of modern colleges with modern management systems, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment”, said the director of the Department of State Policy in the area of training of workers and additional vocational education of the Ministry of Science of Russia, Natalya Zolotarev.
But students don't have global plans.
After three days of training like this, they're probably gonna need a day off.
At the same time, the scores for this examination were quite material.
The latest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding in a timely manner to a claim to our airport at Instagram," was pleased with the game's player, the team's PR manager Sergei Shuvalov of Frankfurt Airport.
The best judges, which is called, are on pencils to invite them to work by the time they finish their studies.
The United States Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the Foreign Literature Library of the American Centre.
The centre worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The United States Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the American Center of the United States Embassy under the All-Russian M.I. Rudomino State Library in Moscow.
"Unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation recently call into question the commitment of the Russian Government to the links between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the cold war and in other difficult moments in the long history of our countries' relations," states the statement of US Ambassador John Tefft at Interfax.
The American Centre has created deep and lasting ties between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was a centre for American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a venue for meetings with numerous American personalities, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Only last year, the American Centre held more than 400 cultural and educational events and hosted more than 50,000 Russian visitors," the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX Educational Exchange Programme (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal proved to be swift in its execution.
Typical situation: four officials stand in front of Judge Swatanter Kumar's desk, listening to his claims to the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-page order to make fun of him, said Kumar.
If there's one more brick on the table, we're gonna have to take down all the existing buildings.
Kumar is the head of the National Green Tribunal (NZT), a judicial body established in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal has dealt with more than 10,000 claims relating to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to discontinue the construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are extremely high: in the 60 years that have elapsed since the declaration of independence of strengthened industrial development, India has become one of the most overcrowded and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large mega-cities, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and few remaining housing estates are shut down for new residential neighbourhoods.
Despite formal State support for the green movement, NZTs are regularly criticized by the Narendra Modi Government, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May this year, for example, the Minister of the Environment called the court's decisions "extreme" and "unenforceable."
Sometimes it is indeed impossible to execute the court's decisions within the time limit, confirmed by environmental counsel Raj Panjwani.
However, unenforceable grandfathers also have a positive side: at least they force responsible persons to move.
"His main goal is to shake this system," adds counsel.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly cancelled major constructions: its account for the cessation of the construction of the airport, the power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
They also try to remember people — for example, when discussing the fate of a pharmaceutical company in Telagna, which contaminated the local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we're responsible for the economic consequences.
"People lose their jobs," commented Kumar.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can be changed by the one hand of the judicial pen.
In April, for example, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, thus causing public outrage.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to reverse the decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Delhi Government on incoming and outgoing vehicles and also offered to purchase 10,000 additional buses, prior to learning from factories whether they were in a position to carry out such an order.
As pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to fall into the court's attention, popular anger began to subside a little.
But the most painful subject of the principled judge was the Gang River Cleanup Program, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganga, a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often stops controlling his emotions and turns to screaming.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from Gang on God's statue, and there were feces in it, the judge is hot.
You keep contaminating the river because you think Gang is Gang, he'll take all our sins.
It's a river we worship, and look what you do to it every day.
Cleaning the Gang is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new Government.
The number of fecal bacteria in this river is now more than 120 times the norm.
Every year, 1.5 million to 3 million of the 700 million Indians bathing in it die of infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Ganga Rescue Fund money derived from the sale of his suit, in which he met with Barack Obama and 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the premiere of populism: the suit was bought for $700,000, while river cleaning takes at least eight billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the cost of progress should be the environment.
"In a developing country, talking about the environment is often perceived as an unaffordable luxury," says the activist Malik Bhanot, the Ganga Zombie.
And the court is trying to find the golden middle between ecology and development."
A man spilled blood on several Dalí paintings at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the exhibition of the Latvian Union of Artists in Riga broke windows in the museum and ruined Salvador Dalí's "Emergence of the Angel".
There is now an exhibition of Salvador Dalí and Pablo Picasso's works at the museum.
A 1985 man came into the sculpture hall at 2:20 p.m.
He immediately led inappropriately: ruined the sculpture, broke the windows.
He then began moving around the premises and stained blood with several permanent display works.
Among them is a portrait of the Hand of the Hand of Miervaldis Polis.
According to the President of the Latvian Union of Artists, Igor Dobochin, referred to by Interfax, the windows were also ruined.
Police and art experts are working at the scene.
The latter determine the extent of the damage and damage.
A criminal case of hooliganism has been instituted against a man.
In the Latvian Union of Artists, an exhibition of Picasso and Dalí works takes place from 4 August to 27 September, featuring more than 200 original works by artists.

Xi Jinping calls for making the economy more open to the world
The economy must become more open to the world to boost its growth, as President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday in addressing a group that is facing the challenge of leading reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and promoting an open policy”, he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Central Lead Group Committee on Comprehensive Reform.
He said that greater openness and reform would give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including regulation of investors' access to the market, change of border controls, encouragement of State-owned enterprises (SOEs) attracting private capital and revision of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be compiled.
The system will be gradually decomposed through trial programs.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a greater role in resource allocation, business rule and openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also weaken control over the powers given to its companies, thereby guaranteeing that companies themselves will run their own businesses.
