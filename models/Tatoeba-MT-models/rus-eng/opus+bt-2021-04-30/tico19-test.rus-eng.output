Rapidly increasing cumulative coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and in the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
Cumulative coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, thus confirming that despite different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units, there is a need to improve preparedness for the influx of COVID-19 patients who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan of Hubei Province of China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new species of coronavirus, now known as type 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), was responsible for the infection.
From then on, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 began to be called a coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 suffer from a mild form of disease, i.e. a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of the patients recovering.
Approximately 14% of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe disease with hospital needs, and in the remaining 6% take a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyses the cumulative trends of COVID-19 in each European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) country and in the United Kingdom and compares them with those in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK with data for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and Great Britain
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 spread to other countries, and in the rest of the world the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamics as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria for WHO to determine the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020, with all three patients returning from Wuhan of Hubei Province of China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750, including 1,441 fatal cases, were in Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative morbidity of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates the number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country of the world daily at 8 a.m., from official sources such as the ministries of health of these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK and to compare them with data for Italy.
The reduced cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in 14 days was calculated as an indicator of the prevalence rate of active COVID-19 cases in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We have also provided a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country as at 8 a.m. on 15 March 2020, compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA and Great Britain
Trends in reduced cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 over a 14-day period in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom were generally consistent with those observed in Hubei Province of China (figure 1).
Cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole began to rise around 21 February, and there was a sharp jump in this indicator (additional material) on 28 February 2020.
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have seen similar trends in cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK, compared with the same for Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as at 8 a.m. on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to that recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the UK.
The cumulative trends observed in COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the different stages in different countries, the different responses taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases and different rules for selecting patients for COVID-19 analysis, including “completion” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive treatment, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions were already as full as possible.
To date, data on admissions from COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) intensive care units in the EU/EEA are only available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not provided).
However, such data should be systematically collected in order to complement current observations that target the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, there is a significant variation in the number of beds in the intensive care and intensive care units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth update of the ECDC report on the results of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment presents scenarios to model the supply of health systems resources with estimates of the hospitalization of infected COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, where the risk of a shortage of accessible beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
As cases are now grouped into certain EU/EEA and UK regions, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a given territorial group, it is recommended that information on infections and the number of beds in intensive care units be provided, if possible, at level 2 units of the Territorial Units Nomenclatures for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the SarS-CoV-2 contact-infection scenario, which has continued unabated over the long term, and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as can be seen in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on the results of the rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and integrated approach to containing the spread of SARS-COV-2 is important, with a consequent shift from containment to minimization, because, given the predicted rapid increase in the number of diseases among decision makers and hospitals, there may simply not be sufficient time to reflect, adopt and adjust their response if such measures are not taken in advance.
The rapid risk assessment report also listed public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time in which they can intensify their monitoring efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, in the coming days or weeks, the health systems in other EU/EEA countries will be faced with an influx of patients who will need intensive treatment.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Coronavirus of the 2nd Type Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) was a tragedy for humanity: more than 3,000 people have now died in China and elsewhere in the world, with more than 80,000 infected.
Like the homologous SARS-CoV virus that led to the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower degree of disease and a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older persons more often than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on new disease, this article offers a relevant and comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving subject matter of the study.
We will consider basic aspects of epidemiology, etymology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction of further currents and prevention of the disease.
While many questions have yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate a dangerous disease.
The Spring Celebration (Chinese New Year), which fell on January 25, 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home throughout the festival and for weeks after it in the wake of the outbreak of a new viral infection.
Given the high resemblance to coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the virus SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease a coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and spread rapidly throughout the country and then to nearly 50 other countries in the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been detected, more than 40,000 patients had recovered, and more than 3,000 patients had died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is an "enemy number one for society" and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etymology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which defined the sequence of the virus isolated from a number of patients.
The review is an attempt to synthesize research findings in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus-induced disease, the coronavirus of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which erupted in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts known to date about the prevention and prediction of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among pathogens that are not fatal to humans and mostly cause about 15% of total respiratory diseases.
However, in this century we have faced twice highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, i.e., the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused an outbreak of disease originally in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other states with a terrifying level of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronavirus infection in human history.
As shown in figure 1.1, the reported clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of the PRC from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health workers were infected, suggesting the possibility of human transmission of the virus.
On 23 January, a quarantine was imposed on Wuhan and urban public transport ceased to operate.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, 21 out of 41 patients with a confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of coronavirus was a global public health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to some 50 other countries around the world (figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scope and risk of an outbreak has yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-central clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed by COVID-19, provided the following updated picture of the epidemic development (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SarS-CoV-2 infected all age groups, but mostly people between the ages of 30 and 65 were infected.
Almost half (47.7%) were over 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SarS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread clusters mainly in Hubei province and in nearby regions.
On average, between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and diagnosis, it took 5 (2–2) days.
The incubation period averaged 4.8 days (3.0–7.2).
From the onset of the symptoms to death, an average of 9.5 (4.8 to 13 days) passed.
The base reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51–4.05), and the corrected R0 was 2.23–4.82.
By January 23, 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infections, coinciding with large-scale transport on the eve of the Chinese New Year celebrations.
Mortality among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10–1.86%) and corrected mortality among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02–4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were: gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large shell viruses containing one strand of meaning RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha- and betacoronaviruses are known to strike people.
In the case of coronaviruses of type SARS and MERS glycoprotein of shypoid processors (S), it is associated with the cell receptors of type 2 angiotensin-revolving enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidiyl peptidaze-4 (DPP4), respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
In cytoplasm, the virus RNA gene is released; after replication of the virus genome, the genomic RNA along with shard glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins generates viria-containing vesicles that then merge with the membrane cell, releasing the virus.
The first genomic sequence reports of SARS-CoV-2 were released on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is found to be a new type of betacoronavirus, the genome of which coincides 99.98% with 10 consecutive specimens collected at the first outbreak of the disease, in the seafood market Juanan in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
With the help of a leaking electronic microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-fine cuts of human respiratory epithelius.
It has been established that the ACE2 human enzyme is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 enzyme weaker than that of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to have a lower degree of illness than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate an previously unknown short-lived protein encoded orf3b and a secreted protein encoded orf8.
The protein orf3b of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can play some role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress the expression IFNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a team of authors led by Zhou (Zhou) presented reports on the cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-size ACE2 human enzyme with a 2.9 Ö resolution in the compound with a transporter amino acid B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-protein, which serves as evidence for the detection and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target during drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate master
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have been bats from which the virus was transmitted to humans via cyvet and camels, respectively.
Using a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 were bats, as the new 96% virus was identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely the coronaviruses of SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21 bats.
However, it remains unknown what kind of intermediate host the virus has managed to overcome the species barrier and infect humans; the route of transmission also remains to be determined.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and colleagues suggested that snakes were vectors of the virus from bat to human, in the process of which homologous recombination occurred in S-protein.
According to their research, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that pangolines, long-fingered mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between the pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference distributed between the two genomes is still very large, so it is considered that the final results with specific evidence are not yet available (figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are for the most part still unknown.
Under laboratory conditions SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and between 40 and 50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and to heat up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; the activity of the virus may be effectively blocked by ether, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlor-containing disinfectants, perucous acid, chloroform, and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorgoxydine.
The human population as a whole does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to a new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed studies conducted on immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
So we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4).
Generally, the host virus first recognizes the congenital immune system through image-identifying receptors (OPRs), including Lectine C-type receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus induces the expression of inflammation factors, the ripening of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons, which contain the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrofags for viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-protein SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.
An adaptive immune response is soon included in the fight against the virus.
T-limphocytes, including CD4+ T cells and CD8+, play an important role in protecting the organism.
T cells CD4+ stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and T cells CD8+ directly kill virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit T cell functions, causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyper-response of the immune system results in the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to lungs and other organs, and in the worst-case scenario lead to polyorganic insufficiency and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2, which is characterized by cluster expression, is more likely to affect older persons with associated pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for those people who are exposed to large numbers of viruses or who have immune system disorders.
According to the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 1 to 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days.
However, an examination of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days, with a range of 0 to 24 days.
A later study, based on the demography of 8,866 cases described above, showed an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0–7.2).
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the timing of quarantine measures to the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected with the disease without any symptoms.
A common practice was a 14-day quarantine for persons with contact with the virus or infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often high temperature, which may be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizzying, headache, throat pain, fainting, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients suffered shortness of breath and (or) hypoxia a week after the disease began.
In severe cases, the disease advanced rapidly and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and (or) respiratory and acute fever should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis, even in the absence of pathologies in chest photos.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 revealed the following symptoms: 98% high temperature, 76% dry cough, 55% short breath and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients needed artificial lung ventilation.
Similar results have been obtained from two recent studies of family infection and transmission of the virus from unsymptomous infections.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in patients with MERS-CoV, who also had high temperatures (98%), dry cough (47%) and breathing (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required artificial lung ventilation, which is much higher than the patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high temperature (99–100 %), dry cough (29–75 %), breathing (40–42%), diarrhoea (20–25%) and throat pain (13–25%), and artificial lung ventilation requires 14–20% of patients.
As at 14 February, COVID-19 deaths were 2 per cent, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this figure, the mortality rate from SARS by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a 37% mortality rate out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Based on an earlier study, the baseline reproduction (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 with 95% confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate a higher potential for SARS-CoV-2 to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for new virus infection is lower than the latter two.
Thus, containing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Cluster manifestations often occur when infected within a single family or group of people gathered together for any reason or caught up in a particular transport, such as a cruise liner.
Patients often travelled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there or had contact with infected or infected persons during the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, according to the reported data, people may be infected with the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients may become infected again when they leave the hospital, and this is an alarming signal to extend the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced levels of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 were diagnosed with lymphops with white blood count < 4×109/L, including white blood cell levels < 1×109/L, as well as elevated asparagin aminotransase and virusemia.
Higher levels of liver enzymes, muscular enzymes and myoglobin were found in the blood of some patients, and most patients experienced elevated levels of C-reactive protein and sedation of red blood cells.
In patients with severe disease, the D-dimer level, fibrin decay product present in the blood, was increased and the number of lymphocytes steadily decreased.
In most patients with COVID-19, the chest X-ray study revealed pathologies characterized by uneven shades on both sides or by "mat glass" type darkening in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory disease (SARS).
Uncontrolled inflammable inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant disruption of the gas exchange when the ARI develops.
Type I and II pneumocyte dysfunction reduces the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of lungs to expand and increase the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst results of the X-ray study often coincide with the worst cases of disease.
On February 18, 2020, COVID-19's first pathological analysis showed the separation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes and inter-tissue lymphocytary infiltration, and multinuclear sincitial cells in lung patients who died of the disease corresponded to the pathology of viral infection and ORI and were similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The main criterion used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 was the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a polymerasic chain reaction with inverse transcriptase (PRC with inverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false negative results that can accelerate the epidemic, since 13 February 2020 China has begun to diagnose on the basis of clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on reverse transcripts for PCRs).
The same was true of the SARS diagnostics.
Thus, effective diagnosis is critical and requires combining data from disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-rays.
On 14 February 2020, a team of specialists, led by Mr. Feng Zhang (Feng Zhang), described the protocol for the application of the SHERLOCK methodology, based on the CRISPR repeat, to detect SARS-CoV-2; this technique allows the detection of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 fragments at a density of 20 × 10-18 moles/L to 200 × 10-18 moles/L (10-100 copies per microliter of the reference sample) by using indicator strips in less than an hour without using sophisticated equipment.
This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity of the tests and their convenience.
Owing to the lack of experience in resisting previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mainly provide patients with COVID-19 only support therapy while trying to apply any therapy that has been used or offered in treating other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immunity suppressors, steroids, recovered patients' plasma, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients was suggested for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
During the initial stages of SARS-CoV-2, attacks mostly the lungs, and may also be less striking other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
However, the disruption of work and the failure of breathing organs are the main threats and causes of death of patients.
Thus, in order to alleviate symptoms and save lives, support for the respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation, and invasive mechanical lung ventilation, are critical, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extra-corporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonal circulatory method used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of wet balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine storm is known to be a consequence of hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process developing in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immunocytes to release huge quantities of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of the ARI and polyorganic insufficiency.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients in serious condition, suppression of immunity is essential.
Corticosteroids and tocilysumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as an interleukin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat cytokin storm.
Other methods of treating cytokinic storm based on suppression of immunity include modulation of the immune response aimed at controlling T cells; blockade of the production of cytokinin IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; suppression of Janus kinase; application of pandiumomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4 and hystondeacetalas inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used to reduce the severity of the effects of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses as suppressors of immunity.
However, steroids in large doses are not useful in treating severe lung injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecosis, which significantly worsen the prediction.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended with caution in treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective anti-virus therapy.
However, the intravenous introduction of the remdesive, a nucleotide equivalent, proved to be an effective treatment for an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesive is a recently developed antivirus drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and the Marburg virus.
Later, the remdesive also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other single-chain RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this data, Gilead has provided this drug formulation to China for pairing studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were proposed as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined lopinavir/ritonavir treatment can be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
Care should be taken to monitor the interaction of these drugs with other drugs assigned to patients.
Recovered patient plasma and antibodies production
Blood withdrawal from patients who have been treated for contagious diseases, for other patients suffering from the same disease, or for the protection of healthy populations, has been used for a long time.
Indeed, the blood of recovered patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to control pathogen.
Antibodies are found in immunoglobulin, produced by B-lymphocytes to control pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target them.
Based on this premise, plasma was isolated from the blood samples of a group of patients treated with COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 seriously ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, inflammation and viral stress decreased, and blood saturation with oxygen increased.
However, an untested and unexplained test is required to suggest a massive application of this method before specific therapy is carried out.
In addition, in view of the therapeutic effect, some of the shortcomings associated with the use of plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune system and cause cytokine emission syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
Antibodies are usually low in the blood, and plasmas are required to treat patients in critical condition.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to single out the V cells of recovered patients and to determine the genetic code of effective antibodies or to screen to find effective antibodies against the critical proteins of the virus.
So we can go straight to mass production of antibodies.
Chinese have used traditional medicine for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on a combination of multiple components of a formula whose composition differs depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on Chinese traditional medicine theories.
Most effective components are still unknown or undefined, as it is difficult to identify and test these components or their optimal combination.
At present, due to the lack of effective specific COVID-19 therapy, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild and moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from a serious stage of illness.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Liang Hua Qing Wen capsules were found effective in COVID-19 treatment.
The largest proportion of recovered patients with COVID-19 were found in several provinces in China where Chinese traditional medicine was used for 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ninxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province where Chinese traditional medicine was used for only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, the lowest recovery rate (13%) was recorded.
However, this is a fairly rough comparison, since the assessment must take into account the many other influences, such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing treatment exclusively in Western medicine and combination treatment in Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time frame for normalizing body temperature, removing symptoms and providing in-patient care had been significantly shorter for patients who had been treated in a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who had been treated only in Western ways.
Most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who began to deteriorate symptomatically (from mild to severe) was markedly lower in the group treated through a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine techniques than in the group treated only by Western methods (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent) and the death rate in the first group was lower than in the second group (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and security of Chinese traditional medicine still require more closely monitored research carried out on a larger scale and in a larger number of regions.
It is also of interest to obtain, where possible, a description of the mechanism for action and an explanation of the effectiveness or combination of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 are mostly strongly afraid of acute and even deadly disease, and people who are closed to quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness, and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
During the early stages of the outbreak of the SARS virus disease, a number of psychiatric diseases were reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psycho-psychological symptoms, dysiria, and even suicidal behaviour.
The mandatory monitoring of contacts and quarantine, which are among the measures taken by the health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase the anxiety and guilt of people associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, to persons suspected of and in contact with them, and to all other people who require it.
As part of psychological support, multidisciplinary psychiatric teams should be formed, regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans should be made clear, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the transmission chain from animal carriers and infected people to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to anti-virus therapy to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
S-protein-based vaccines have been developed to provide long-lived and highly active antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal research has developed live weakened vaccines against SARS viruses.
However, prior to the commencement of clinical research, it is still necessary to determine the impact of these possible vaccines in the natural environment when used in age patients, the pattern of lethal doses and the degree of protection against the infection of zoonous viruses.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of disease caused by the MERS virus continue to occur, emerging in the Middle East and spreading to other regions through the conservation of zoonous sources in endemic habitats.
To combat MERS, vaccination strategies were developed using inactivated virus, DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies were evaluated in animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for persons without immunity is an urgent and critical task that needs to be addressed to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long time (average of 18 months) needed to develop the vaccine and the dynamic modification of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical current of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with the high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
Therefore, it is critical for health authorities to develop a predictive model of the disease in order to prioritize their interventions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on the clinical studies submitted so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prediction of the current of patients with COVID-19 (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the current of the SARS virus disease, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to have initial diseases and complications and were significantly older than patients who did not require such treatment (average 66 years versus 51 years), indicating that age is a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000) as mentioned above.
Disease and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute damage to myocardial and arrhythmia.
Cardiological events were also the main cause of death of patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 was also reported to be able to contact ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver damage in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and underlying diseases are closely interrelated and may distort the results.
Deviations detected in laboratory studies: the C-reactive protein level in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage and is suggested to be a potential predictive factor of the disease's current, reaction to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested that the relationship between the C-reactive protein level, the severity of the disease and the COVID-19 projection should be taken into account.
In addition, higher levels of lactatdehydrogenase, asparagin aminotransferases, alanin aminotransferases and creatinkinases can also predict the result.
These enzymes are released in large quantities by different organs, especially in the heart and livers, and their release occurs when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: To predict the results and complications of COVID-19 treatment, data from the chest X-ray study and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account among other factors.
The use of steroids: as described above, steroids are inhibitors of immunity, commonly used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
As corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecosis, causing lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if needed, steroids should be used to treat patients with COVID-19 patients in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, many patients suffer from unexpected severe stress in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, as they often have to endure long quarantine periods, cope with high levels of uncertainty and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
Mental counselling and long-term support must be provided in order to relieve the stress of such patients and help them return to normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to differ in its characteristics from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tracts, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common cold diseases, can successfully reproduce in the upper respiratory tracts and cause weak symptoms or not cause symptoms at the early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients who have an early stage of the disease or have not yet completed the incubation period may, through their normal lives, spread the virus on a significant scale, making epidemiological monitoring very difficult.
However, the transmission of the SARS-CoV virus was thought to occur when patients were seriously ill, although in most cases it did not occur at an early stage of infection.
So today's COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it's harder to control.
China is currently engaged in a major effort to establish a universal quarantine in Wuhan and neighbouring cities and to extend the quarantine regime to virtually the entire population in order to break the SARS-CoV-2 virus chain.
Although these measures have caused enormous damage to the economy and other areas of the country ' s life, the number of new patients identified is declining, indicating a slow-down in the spread of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak will end by March, and the phase of dilapidation will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and his colleagues estimated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which appeared far more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini developed a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could hit two thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian team reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been detected in nose and throat swabs taken from patients who had recovered and discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to the flu.
However, the decline in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, pointing out that the strategies currently in place may have had an impact.
According to initial projections, Ebola was expected to hit up to a million people and cause half a million deaths.
But through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually brought under control.
Like the SARS-CoV virus, it is likely that the infection potential of SARS-CoV-2 may weaken, and it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans over time.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through cough or sneeze, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been detected in the calve, which means that an oral-fect mode of transmission is also possible.
According to a recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of infection in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even others who are in contact with patients or infected.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is wearing facial masks; and surgical masks, and N95-class respirators (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not allow microcaples of liquid from potentially infected to fly in the air and settle on the surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 class masks (No. 1860s series) can protect viriones of 10 to 80 nm from inhalation, they miss only 5% of viriones; SARS-CoV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks folded together, medical personnel directly in contact with patients must wear N95-class masks (series No. 1860s), rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care workers should wear an appropriate protective robe to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a class N95 mask; the virus may have entered his system through inflammable eyes.
Medical personnel should therefore also wear transparent face panels or closed-type protection glasses.
All people in affected or potentially endangered regions are urged to wash their hands more frequently with disinfectants, to try not to leave the home while insulating themselves and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
The distance to the patient is considered to be about one metre.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was previously unknown to humanity, its high degree of resemblance to SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, was to be a wake-up call for China, taking into account the experience it acquired during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control calmed the citizens, reporting that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductiveity in human-to-human transmission and that prevention and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement greatly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal losses.
China's health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since every word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information coming from clinics rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to contain a potential epidemic at an early stage of its development rather than reassure the public; and (4) more often conduct targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly monitor and improve the public response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the previously unexplored coronavirus of Type 2 severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease had spread throughout China and, at the time of writing, had spread to 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus and COVID-19 symptoms are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the outbreak of COVID-19 gave rise to a sense of SARS relapse.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are significant in terms of containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older persons more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality rates among older persons are also higher than among young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even in an unsymptomic course of disease, while patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases of disease, so it is more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative conventional samples for SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, cured patients can show positive samples to the virus again.
All of this greatly increases the risk of the virus spreading.
Against the background of such rapid advances in COVID-19 research, some crucial issues remain to be resolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 percent homologist between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses of bats, we still cannot claim that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
What kind of animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the course of transmission, and the epidemiological situation can worsen at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus inject into respiratory cells and induce subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to cells producing ACE2 in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve through human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global pandemic, will it disappear like SARS, or will it recur like flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and to return to normal life.
Zoonous origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation stimulated the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoV) were known to cause a mild disease such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our understanding of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The introduction of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China in late 2019 again drew attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmission but weaker pathogenicity of this virus than the related SARS-CoV virus.
The coronavirus infection of humans is zoonosis, and understanding its zoonous origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.
The definition of animal carriers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Examination of the interaction of animals carrying coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonic origin and modes of interspecies transmission.
It is important to note that we compare and compare different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current coronavirus epidemic, discovered in 2019 (COVID-19), is also considered in this context.
In addition, the conditions necessary for a successful change of vectors and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of block viruses with one positive-polar strand of RNA.
These viruses, with the largest RNA-containing genome containing 26 to 32,000 nucleotides, have been named because of their form, which, when viewed under an electronic microscope, resembles a crown.
From a structural point of view, coronaviruses contain unspewed genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are broadcast in polyproteins of the pp1a and pp1a.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins, referred to as nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open reading framework for structured proteins, including a spiked protein (S), a shell protein (E), a membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other coronavirus lines also encoded a number of liniespecific accessor proteins.
Based on differences in sequences, protein\coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses), with betacoronavirus species comprising most human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and betacoronaviruses is bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecies barriers, and some have evolved to human-threatening pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five betacoronaviruses include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), coronavirus of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type two SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild-shaped symptoms such as cold and (or) diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV viruses, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (SARS) and showing extra-light symptoms.
The first strand of human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample of patients separated from the nasal of patients suffering from a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has generated more detailed knowledge of HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that the infection of human coronavirus was generally considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people were overtreated and the total death rate was approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease sporadically spreading to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, discovered in 2019, is the cause of the current coronavirus infection epidemic of 2019 (COVID-19), which, as of March 3, 2020, had claimed more than 3,120 lives, and the number of infected persons exceeded 91,000.
An alarming signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are of zoonosic origin, their sources being bats, mice, or pets.
Numerous data sets show in favour of the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to whose organisms the viruses have adapted well and in which they have no pathogenic properties but demonstrate a wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a severe challenge to China and the world from a medical, scientific, social and moral point of view.
A study of the zoonic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will make it possible to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution, and the factors limiting interspecies transport.
It may also help or accelerate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifying carrier SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the disease from spreading again in the future.
This overview provides general information on zoonosic origin, interspecies transmission and human coronavirus pathogenesis.
In particular, we refer to and consider the following general feature: the initial viruses from which human coronaviruses originated are usually not pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to the new wearer.
We are also analysing the trend of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by the weakening of pathogenic properties.
The result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before strain B814 of the HCoV-229E virus was first obtained from a sample of cold-distinguished patients, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been detected in recent decades.
Table 1 provides an informative and illustrative history of the detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from patients' respiratory tracts with an infectious upper respiratory tract injury in 1966; the virus subsequently adapted to reproduction in the WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with the HCoV-229E virus showed cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, general disease, and throat pain, with high temperatures and coughing observed in 10 to 20 per cent of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from the organ culture and a subsequent serial pass to the brain of the sputum mice.
Clinical signs of infection with the HCV-OC43 virus appear to be similar to those of the HCV-229E virus, the symptoms of which are indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza type A viruses and rhinviruses.
Both the HCV-229E virus and the HCV-OC43 virus are common worldwide and are generally transmitted in winter at moderate latitudes.
Most of the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week and is followed by approximately a two-week disease.
According to a study on volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCV-229E virus developed a common cold of light shape.
Only a few patients with reduced immunity experienced severe lower respiratory infections.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the "atypical pneumonia epidemic", was the first well-documented pandemic ever caused by human coronavirus, and the disease was caused by SARS-CoV, the third of the discovered human coronaviruses.
The first case of SARS was detected at the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread across many countries and continents.
Excluding superactive distributors, it was estimated that each patient could infect approximately two more people; the incubation period ranged from 4 to 7 days, and the virus load peaked on 10 days of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially showed muscle pains, headaches, high temperatures, general malaise and chill, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, cough, and respiratory failure.
The common laboratory deviations from the SARS standard are lymphopenia, liver failure and increased creatinkinase.
patients with SARS also have diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and macrofags.
Approximately 20–30 percent of patients later require intensive care and mechanical lung ventilation.
In such severe cases, other organs, including gastrointestinal tract organs, livers and kidneys, may also be infected, in addition to lower respiratory tracts, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which may prove lethal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from the open biopsy of a patient's lung relative who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on human coronaviruses.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was found that it mainly affects young children, the elderly and patients with reduced immunity and respiratory diseases.
In the case of the disease caused by HCoV-NL63, manifestations such as colding, conjunctivitis, high temperature, and bronchiolyte are characteristic.
Another independent study described the release of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was detected in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for approximately 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases, with peaks in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngite, which is also called croup.
HCV-HKU1 was allocated in Hong Kong that same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolith.
In addition to out-of-hospital pneumonia and bronchiolyte, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with increased asthmatic diseases.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, the HCV-HKU1 virus causing respiratory diseases of light shape was detected worldwide.
All four human coronaviruses causing non-hospital infections have adapted well to humans, and their mutation, resulting in highly pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents were also unknown, as in the rare example of the more virulent subtype HCV-NL63, which has recently reportedly caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Usually, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic by acquiring the ability to communicate effectively and remain in the human body.
The coronavirus of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Most of the laboratoryly confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia there were inbound cases and distribution through occasional secondary cases of contamination with close contact.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by coronaviruses transmitted to humans.
More than 30 per cent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratoryly confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4 per cent) have been recorded, so MERS-CoV is considered one of the deadliest viruses known to man.
Between mid and late December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified, which is now associated with a type 2 coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2) as they look back.
The World Health Organization has announced that the continuing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been called "coronavirus infection 19" (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a death rate of approximately 3.4 per cent.
It should be noted that the death rate is 4.2 per cent in the Chinese province of Hubei and 1.2 per cent outside.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by rising temperatures, coughing and breathing.
Some patients also suffer from diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is capable of rapidly changing to acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nonetheless form different branches of phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but has a greater transferability than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of unsymptomous infection of SARS-CoV-2 have been recorded, indicating the ability of the virus to spread rapidly throughout the world.
Comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, human-transmitted coronaviruses have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease they cause.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronaviruses causing extra-hospital infections (i.e. HCV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to those most commonly observed with human coronaviruses causing extra-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms, or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of COVID-19 heavy cases can be distinguished, although the ratio is slightly lower here.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also features interesting patterns that characterize both human coronaviruses causing extra-hospital infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transferability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as human coronaviruses causing extra-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it is yet to be verified whether the transferability of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transition of the virus (i.e. the infection of each next person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses causing extra-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in rock samples.
We have yet to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral route of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, which is characteristic of human coronaviruses causing extra-hospital infections.
Nevertheless, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenicity and sustainable distribution after human transition.
All four human coronaviruses causing extra-hospital infections with mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it may have been people who have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be described as the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronaviruses causing severe diseases in humans and people whose human coronaviruses cause severe diseases simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in the human body to a sufficient extent that there is a accumulation of adaptive mutations that counter the constraints of the host.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the greater the chance that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to stop its transmission among people by quarantine or other measures to control infectious diseases.
For many years, four extra-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population causing a normal cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses don't need a reserve animal.
The highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well enough, and their transmission among humans cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and reproduce in their zoonosy reservoirs and to search for sensitive human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or augmenting carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features such as SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and four extra-hospital HCV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as extra-hospital HCoV, at least at present.
But it is more pathogenic than non-hospital HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it adapts completely to man and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate carrier animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, augmenting and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
The animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a close-born ancestor with the same high homology at the level of the nucleotides sequence.
The ancient virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this medium.
Similarly, the reserve carrier has been constantly carrying HCoV for a long time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
By contrast, if HCoV was only recorded in an intermediate medium just before or around the time when it was recorded to a person, it was not well adapted to the new wearer and often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as a zoonosic source of human infection and play the role of an augmenting carrier by allowing the virus to be replicated by lightning and then passing it on to people, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCoV can withstand a dead end infection if it cannot withstand transmission inside the intermediate host.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to intermediate carriers and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that SARS' zero patient had contact with hunting and fishing animals (divines) in the past.
Further studies of seroprevalence have shown that animal traffickers have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV than the general population.
The Himalayan Cyvetes (Paguma larvata) and the raccoon-like dog in living animal markets were the first installed carriers of viruses like and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all cibets in the markets, no cases of SARS were reported anymore.
At the same time, it was reported that in Himalayan cyvetes living in or on farms and not entering markets, most SARS-CoV was not determined, suggesting that the Himalayan cyvetes could only serve as an intermediate augmenting carrier, rather than a natural SARS-CoV reservoir.
Notably, as 80 per cent of the various animals in the Guangzhou markets have antibodies for SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out that multiple species of small mammals can also serve as intermediate augmenters.
They all seem to be dead end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
A follow-up search for the natural carrier SARS-CoV revealed a closely related CoV bat, which was called a coronavirus related to atypical pneumonia by the coronary-bearing bat HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese submarine-bearing bats.
These mice are positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses of bats have 88–92 per cent of the same holology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundations for a new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) were also detected in bats, but none of them, except one that denotes WIV1, cannot be isolated as a living virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It has been shown that WIV1 derived from a sample of bat fecals uses ACE2 bats, cyvet and human as a receptor for entering the cell.
Curiously, the recovery serums from SARS could have neutralized WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95 percent of the homolog of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus SARS-CoV, and bats are not the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
Philogenetic analysis assigns MERS-CoV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats, and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dieptildiptidazu-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of the MERS-CoV virus phylogenetically closer to sequences from bat betacoronaviruses detected in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild bats have not found a live MERS-CoV virus.
The homologies of the MERS-CoV nucleotide sequences and his closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats only match by 87%.
So bats may not have been the direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-handed camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
Living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal swabs of single-arb camels, further confirming the role of camels as true MERS-CoV reservoir carriers.
It is also worth noting that camels with experimentally infected MERS-CoV had minor symptoms, but massive virus fission.
Notably, infected camels released the virus not only by respiratory but also by fecal oral route, which is also the main route of virus separation in bats.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome did not have contact with camels in the past prior to the onset of symptoms and are plausiblely related to human transmission or transmission by unknown channels that include unidentified species of animals that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The homology of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides coincides by 96.2% with the CoV RaTG13 bats isolated from Asian horseshoes Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the hierarchy of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute to them parent relations.
So bats may not have been the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless almost identical coronaviruses of bats are found in the future.
The direct carriers of SARS-CoV-2 should presumably be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Uhanian wholesale seafood market, which involved many initial COVID-19 cases, indicating a likely case of animal transmission to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolines (Manis javanica) could also carry a parent betacoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homology of the sequences of nucleotides of these new genomes of pangoline coronavirus coincides with SARS-CoV-2 by 85–92%.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with an identity at the nucleotide sequence level of about 90%.
They cluster into two lines of differentiation of viruses like SARS-CoV-2, in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor binding domain (RDD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
Quite the contrary, RSDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more diluent, despite a higher homology of sequences throughout the genome.
An earlier study of pangoline patients also reported the determination of viral contigations in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of assembly and manual processing were used to obtain a genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full size virus genome.
The possibility that pangolin has become one of the intermediate carrier animals of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangoline.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses of pangolines associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution path SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolines and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest sequence homology was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence homology within the genome.
Very theoretically, a high degree of resemblance between betacoronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is related to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposing proposal favours a recombination between the betacoronavirus of pangolines, related to SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonous origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to HCoV highly pathogenic viruses, the zoonous origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 viruses is also being investigated.
Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E can occur from coronaviruses of bats, while parent viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 strains have been found in rodents.
It was reported that the bat coronavirus named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected at the North American tricolored crocinogue showed close affinity with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier might also be camels.
For clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
Philogenetic analysis provided evidence of HCoV interspecies transmission events in history.
When an interspecies transmission of the HCoV-OC43 virus occurred around 1890 and people contracted from domestic animals, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E interspecies transmission is not so clear.
Alphacoronaviruses of bats closely related to HCoV-229E were detected.
Between them is alphacoronavirus alpaca.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpaca, who could contact bats in the general ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpaca.
Second, alphacoronaviruses of bats, related HCV-229E, in bats are diverse and nonpathogenic, while alphacoronavirus alpaca caused a respiratory disease attack in infected animals.
Finally, alphacoronavirus alpaca was not detected in wild animals.
Thus, the probability that alpacas received alphacoronavirus, related to HCoV-229E, from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogen viruses, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipach virus, and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCV-229E to people.
On the other hand, while bat alphacoronaviruses could serve as a gene pool of HCoV-229E virus, alpaca and single-handed camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to people, just as in the case of MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV provides an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to single-handed camels and from single-handed camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known from its original identification and was then confirmed by subsequent studies.
Clearly, bats provide a rich pool of virus varieties for interspecies gene exchange and interspecies transmission.
Long-term longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction, and the ability to fly make bats "ideal distributors".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to one-handed camels a decade ago.
He adapted well to these camels, which became a stable and natural reservoir carrier from an intermediate carrier.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low frequency of mutations.
Its occasional transmission to a person is an accident, and the person remains a dead end carrier of MERS-CoV as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, pangoline betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolines.
They can be dead end carriers of betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as cyvetes in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several possibilities for inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from human animals should be confirmed or excluded.
First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats through coal mining or carving of the carcasses of these animals.
Second, pangolines can be one of the intermediate augmenting carriers into which the related SARS-CoV-2 virus recently entered.
People are infected with the virus through carving and eating wild animal meat.
It is quite possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of domestic and wild animals on antibodies is justified.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third form, which was in contact with both bats and pangolines.
Search for animal origin SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, three major factors from viruses have also contributed to cross-species barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered "moderately-high" with an average rate of substitution of approximately 10–4 substitutions per year in one plot 2 depending on the phase of coronavirus adaptation to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have a corrective exorbonuclease, the removal of which results in an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening or even non-violation.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesire suppresses the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exorbonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesire is one of the most promising means against SARS-CoV-2 to be tested in clinical research.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.
In addition, mutation frequency can often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the wearer.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation frequency, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of human adaptation.
Presumably, this virus has already adapted to another wearer close to man.
Apart from SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, well adapted to single-handed camels.
Theoretically, vaccines and antiviral drugs from SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to lose their effectiveness rapidly as a result of genetic drift.
Second, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses results in greater plasticity in the genomic modification of mutations and recombination, thus increasing the probability of interspecies coevolution, which is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by the many unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3'-end genome.
Third, thanks to a unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcription of the DNA of the coronavirus in the carrier, which serves as a mixing receptacle, threads are often switched.
Highmological full-size and subgenome RNAs can recombin and create new coronaviruses.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 and in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus carrier interaction with respect to transmission
In addition to the above three viral factors, the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor is another key factor for inter-species transmission.
This article cites the SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in inter-species transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis between SARS-CoV strains of humans and cyvetes, SARS-CoV is considered to undergo rapid adaptation in different media, especially with regard to mutations on RSD protein S.
In general, RSD protein S coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor, and the carrier's antibody's response is intensively taken away.
SARS-CoV's RSD are amino acids, with 318th to 510th, on a fragment of S1, which, to introduce the virus into the cell, binds to the angiotensinpreventive enzyme 2 (APF2) of humans as well as its tracers.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD is able to recognize the APF2 receptors of various animals, including bats, cyvetes, mice, and raccoon dog, making it possible to transmit the virus in interspecies.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in the RSD that differ from human viral strains and cyvetes, 4 of which are in a receptor binding motive to interact with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civetes have mutations K479N and S487T in the RSD, which can increase the affinity of the interaction of the spiked protein with the human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important for human adaptation.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30 percent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 segment of protein S results in the binding affinity of protein S to human APF2 could change.
Indeed, a cryoelectronic microscope study says that the affinity of this connection is 10 to 20 times higher than between APF2 and the SARS-CoV virus S protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other tracers were required for the transfer of SARS-CoV-2.
It is surprising that HCoV-NL63 is also connected to APF2, but to another segment of S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as the aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E and 9-O-acetylic acid for HCV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from animal carriers.
In addition to cellular receptors, the inter-species transmission of HCoV is also controlled by other media dependency and restriction factors.
The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural HCoVs reservoir carriers, such as bats, single-handed camels and rodents, can constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Successful inter-species transmission of HCoV viruses requires the usurpation of dependency factors and the subordination of vector rectification factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between virus and host still need to be defined and categorised.
Good results can be achieved by impartial full-genome screening of dependency factors and retrieving hosts for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPPR technology.
Emerging new HCoV: Back to zero
The variety of coronaviruses of bats creates a wide range of opportunities for new HCoVs to emerge.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein encoding genes has the potential for radical modification of virus phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessor proteins, ORF8 is considered important for human adaptation as bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but it has been established that they encode the ORF8 diverse proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide division characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses was detected.
This division breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gammacoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant plots were identified in RNA-dependent RNA-polymeraz.
Localizations of the recombination were also defined in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV was subjected to recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-handed camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs in which HCoV recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, which is likely to result from the virus being removed from the given breeding pressures, such as the immune system of the host.
An example of such effects is the loss of a full-size ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to binucleotide separation.
While an intact open frame of ORF4 reading can be seen in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alphacoronavirus alpaca shows a single nucleotide insert, resulting in a shift in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also due to the sampling pressure on their reservoir carriers.
Infecting bats with coronaviruses recorded weak symptoms or their absence, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turns out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of an inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed by the apregulation of the inhibitor receptor of NKG2/CD94 natural killer cells and the low level of expression of the molecules of the main class-I histocompatibility complex.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen forms that is provided by high metabolic activity of bats can suppress coronavirus replication, while affecting exorbonuclease reading, thus creating a selection pressure to generate strains of the virus that, when entered into a new medium, prove to be highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the host.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged in the last twenty years.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause slight symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They are confidently replicated without causing a strong immune response from the host.
That is the secret to why we see unsymptomous carriers and what causes the serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly related to hyperactivity of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung injury.
On the contrary, in the unsymptom-free carriers, the immune response does not involve a replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy of unattached immune response can have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
The bats have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, the adoption of type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, should have a beneficial effect in humans.
In addition, in bats, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasoma has been disrupted.
Based on this, inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasoma using MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While betacoronavirus of bats was found, whose nucleotide homology coincides 95% with SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of bats, whose nucleotide homology coincides 96% with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was discovered that cyvetes and other animals in markets carried viruses identical to SARS-CoV, direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 were not installed.
Betacoronaviruses of pangolin were found, striking homologous SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolines could serve as an intermediate carrier or that fragments of betacoronavirus genes of pangolines could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by man.
Coronaviruses attracted general attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonic origin and HCoV reserve animals in human transmission.
The conclusive evidence showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and were passed on to man through intermediate carriers.
If the SARS-CoV infection comes from human-civette contact in the markets, closing the game markets and destroying the cyvet in them could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of various lines of betacoronaviruses of pangolines close to SARS-CoV-2, pangolines should be removed to prevent zoonous transmission of the infection from the food markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals and how this can continue to be the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus had long existed in single-handed camels.
These camels are an important vehicle as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and in Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to donate all camels to control MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop periodic MERS outbreaks, an integrated approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in conjunction with other infectious control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can appear that cause outbreaks of disease.
A variety of zoonous coronaviruses are circulating around the world.
In particular, coronaviruses of bats with zoonous potential are extremely diverse.
There are many possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonosic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses, which are more easily transmitted and (or) more deadly to humans.
In order to reduce the number of unnecessary contacts between humans and animals, the culture of wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.
After severe trials such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, there is a need for better preparedness and a plan to respond to such situations.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until the possibility of seizing new territories arises.
While many of the properties of bats are favourable to the spread of viruses, by teaching people to stay away from them, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals can be minimized.
A better understanding of the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers requires constant epidemiological surveillance of mammals, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from human animals and future outbreaks of disease.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonosis viruses.
In the puzzle of zoonosic origin, SARS-CoV-2 still lacks some fragments.
First, if bats have transmitted the ancestor SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolines share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if the third mammal is the true intermediate carrier, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it be a bat, a pangoline, or another mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified from their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolution path SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" COVID-19 need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our group published a short reference guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides us with lessons learned and validated recommendations to combat the pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has gradually increased based on current research and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the document "Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19" (7th version) issued by the PRC National Health Committee.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus outbreak occurred 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially known as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus disease itself was called "heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2" (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a short reference guide and published it on the Internet on the website of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This publication has attracted great attention.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, between 16 January and 3 March 2020, seven issues of the "Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19" published by the PRC National Health Committee (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) were published, with some of its provisions significantly changing.
Recent work by Zhou with co-authors has provided comments on our recommendations, with simple proposals for diagnostics based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations, as well as valuable background information on this pandemic that has spread throughout the world.
We reaffirm the value of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19 (trying version 7) and from ongoing research, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of this document (dated March 3, 2020), in order to perform a comprehensive analysis when a case of suspected illness is confirmed, it is necessary to combine one element of the characteristics of epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of movements or residences in and around Wuhan and other localities where COVID-19 cases were recorded within 14 days of symptoms; (2) history of contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and its surroundings or other localities where COVID-19 cases were reported during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases with high temperature or respiratory symptoms recorded within 2 weeks in small areas such as home or apartment, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external occurrences of COVID-19; (3) total white blood cells are normal or reduced with reduced lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on suspicion of a disease with one of the following points of pathogen or serological evidence, namely: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-genome sequencing of the virus shows high homogenity for new coronaviruses; (3) the positive results of the serotest for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies IgM and IgG; or the change of the test result from negative to positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies IgG, or the increase of the titra at least four times in the recovery phase relative to the corresponding indicator at the acute phase.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions of the said document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in respiratory routes or blood samples was added.
Pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; then the seventh issue added the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on continuous work by researchers to find an optimal set for nucleic acid detection in rapid diagnosis, as well as for analysis of respiratory samples, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of different samples and facilitates the incorporation of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirmation of the disease.
However, there is increasing evidence of the need to be cautious in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients with no expressed symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou's work, etc., should be updated, as it classifies persons without clinical symptoms as a group of "low risk".
The assessment system also needs to be clarified in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspect cases” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in the countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the day maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 in a day.
That's the highest death rate of the virus in a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Disease Epidemiology, Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that there were 114 current cases among the registered cases, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Mirjaby Sabrina Flora told that the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the dead were over the age of 60, two between the ages of 51 and 60, and one between the ages of 41 and 50.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
A clinic official told the local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwaiti Meitrey Clinic.
On Saturday, on an online video statement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, stated that public transport would be discontinued for a longer period than originally scheduled until next Saturday.
Public transport was stopped from 26 March and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods — medicines, fuel and food — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Bangladesh on 8 March for two people who had returned from Italy, as well as one of their wives.
As of March 19, these three people had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 crossed the millionth point of infection worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total incidence of coronavirus infection by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded one million.
Coronavirus COVID-19 killed at least 52,000 people.
The turn came on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first coronavirus death was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries that did not have a coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours preceding 10:00 Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, referring to Johns Hopkins University data, reported that more than 1,000 deaths due to coronavirus infection were recorded in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced stronger measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the isolation of the city's citizens until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin had previously stated that Russians throughout the country, despite being isolated, would receive wages until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of an extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; voting results: 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while previously the curfew had only been extended from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio State Governor, Mike Dewein, announced that the state's home isolation regime had been extended by order until 1 May.
Stores in Australia limit the number of packages of toilet paper that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian networks of Woolworths and Coles stores reduced the number of packages of toilet paper that could be purchased at one time in all the country's stores, to two and one, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a restriction on one package.
These restrictions were reported in cashier announcements as well as on the Facebook page of the network.
Citizens reportedly started making emergency stockpiles because of fears that COVID-19 might trigger a general isolation regime.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Previously, March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this quantity to four packages.
Coles's shopping network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that, with the imposition of a restriction on four packages, "the toilet paper is still being bought too fast in many stores, one shipment within an hour," and called such demand "unprecedented", while ALDI in a Facebook post published on Tuesday called such a trend "unexpected".
According to a representative of Woolworths, sales increased sharply last week.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also limited this number to two packages.
To fill the deficit, Coles began ordering larger shipments from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional shipments, while ALDI made stocks for a special early-selling stock on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Rhythlers Association, reported that the Rhythlers were trying to replenish the stocks, but this was made difficult by local authorities' restrictions on truck schedules.
It expects higher product costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, but fewer and less profitable offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to stock depletion, some stores could not hold shares on Wednesdays.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, told that shops replenished stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper was a bulky commodity, so the quantity of stock was small, and after the sale of the whole volume of the goods, the long rows of shelves remained empty, increasing the sense of lack of stock.
"Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelves could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers probably wouldn't panic so much," says Russell Zimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of the reprocessed toilet paper Who Gives a Crap reported the end of stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a company manufacturing toilet paper Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent brand goods, reported that they operated 24 hours a day to ensure sufficient quantities of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne fell due to the absence of buyers during the week of Labor Day, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first bidders.
The Thursday issue of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed to cut and use as toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australia report of March 3, the stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, claiming that they did not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, halantery, handwashing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, on Sunday evening it was observed that the online store of the British supermarket Okado also limited the sale of Andreas toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of COVID-19 infectious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term “pandemic” describes only the extent of the disease and not the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that national Governments need to take action:
"All countries together are still able to influence the development of the pandemic".
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, isolate the sick, monitor the occurrence of the disease and mobilize their citizens," explained Mr. Tedros Adam Gebreisus, Director-General of WHO.
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming prevalence and seriousness of the disease and the alarming level of inaction".
According to Dr. Tom Freeden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that "no other respiratory virus other than flu has yet been tracked from its inception to continued global spread."
Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before."
First, in January, WHO declared an outbreak of the disease to be a public health emergency of international importance and then gave it a new status, the pandemic.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, said about the outbreak: "This is just the beginning, it's going to get worse."
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases were reported worldwide for Thursday, and more than 4,600 people died.
The coronavirus pandemic of 2019–2020 is a present-day coronavirus disease pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome –2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and a public health emergency was declared on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, killing approximately 97,000 people.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficult breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive: recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering mouths at cough, observing distance between humans, identifying and ensuring self-insolvency of people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, workplace risk control and closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has resulted in serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as a widespread shortage of goods exacerbated by panic shopping.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 per cent of students worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has begun to spread on the Internet, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people who resemble them externally, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where the virus has been widely spread.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased as a result of reduced travel and closure of heavy industries.
On December 31, 2019, the health authorities of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China, reported cases of pneumonia with unknown cause, and an investigation into the situation began in early January 2020.
Infections were mainly related to the seafood wholesale market of Juanan, so the virus is believed to be of zoonous origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recently discovered virus with a large resemblance to bat coronaviruses, pangoline coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease originated on December 1, 2019, and the infected did not attend the market after that date.
Two thirds of the cases recorded in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, a publication by the South China branch of the newspaper Morning Post, which has not been verified, suggested that the very first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of infection in China had declined, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases of infection outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The incidence of disease can be significantly underestimated, in particular because of the many cases with weak symptoms.
By 26 February, there had been relatively few cases of infection among young people, with patients under 19 years of age and younger accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of the world ' s cases, and the United Kingdom ' s Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Wallans, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected before effective group immunity was established.
Statistics include cases of contamination of people who were tested for COVID-19 and whose test was positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had adopted an official policy not to test with only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected in China before 23 January, and that such unregistered patients had become a source of infection for 79% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual infections in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of basic reproductive infection (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that this figure could be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 recover safely.
In other, more complex cases, the time from onset of symptoms to death ranged from 6 to 41 days, with the most frequent time being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were among persons over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent of those killed had associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, Official data on deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include deaths of patients with positive COVID tests performed under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not include those who have not been tested — for example, in the case of deaths in their homes, nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded official COVID figures four to five times.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: "We know that [the claimed number of deaths] is lower than actual." His words are confirmed by reports of some isolated cases in the United States. This incomplete accounting is often found in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was recorded in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside Mainland China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines and outside Asia in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods are commonly used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary according to region and time; they are also affected by levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment systems used, the time since the outbreak of the disease and population parameters such as age, gender and general health status. The death/infectibility ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97,039/1 617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality to morbidity ratio fell from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include determining the percentage of deaths due to illness (CFR) — the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease and the percentage of deaths due to infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the performance of certain population groups from infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.
According to the University of Oxford Center for Evidence Medicine, the death rate from the pandemic is generally between 0.1 and 0.39%.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random COVID-19 testing in Germany, as well as a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact duration of the flash cannot be defined and may vary according to location.
Macei Boni, a staff member at the University of Pennsylvania, claims that "uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to come out on the plateau, and then, when the number of available carriers ends, they begin to go out.
In the current situation, however, it is virtually impossible to make any reasonable forecast as to when this will happen.”
Zhong Nanshan, Senior Medical Adviser to the Chinese government, claims that "everything can end by June" if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will circulate, possibly for a year or two".
According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, "until a vaccine (perhaps 18 months or more) is created", physical distance and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a member of Vanderbilt University, believes, "I don't think this coronavirus will ever disappear forever, because it is so easily transmitted," and that it "may become a seasonal disease, flashing every year."
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may experience the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are elevated temperatures (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, wetting in respiratory tracts (sis), loss of smell, breath, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chill, vomiting, haemorrhage, diarrhoea or cyanosis, WHO claims to be seriously ill with respiratory problems of about one in six people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list urgent symptoms such as respiratory difficulty, permanent pain or chest depression, sudden sensation of confusion of consciousness, difficulty in awakening and blueding the face or lips. If these symptoms are present, you should immediately seek medical attention. Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory dystress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
In some infected people, the disease may occur unsympathically, without any clinical symptoms, but the results of the tests confirm the infection, so doctors recommend that those who are in close contact with confirmed patients be placed under strict control and tested for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that the incidence of unsymptomous disease varies from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; it is usually five days; so far, the smell loss symptom is not fully clear: initial estimates of the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed the symptom were originally 30 per cent and then down to 15 per cent.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact as well as through small drops released into the air with coughing, sneezing, or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, in open cough, drops can spread from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
There are suggestions that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops released into the air during conversation, which can stay in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory drops can also be formed when exhaled, including during conversation, although the virus is not usually transported by air.
Drops may fall into the mouth or nose of nearby people as well as in the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (CPR), can lead to exhalation and hence spread the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if the person touches the contaminated surface, including the skin, with subsequent touch to his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus can be transmitted through feces, but the risk of this mode of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of a fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days of the onset of the symptoms, although its spread can occur both before the symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where tests were positive in testing three days before the symptoms appeared, suggesting that the virus could be transmitted before the symptoms were expressed.
There are only a few reported laboratoryly confirmed cases of unsymptomous disease, but contact-tracking studies in some countries have also identified cases of transmission from unsymptom-free carriers.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claims that it is not clear yet how easily the virus spreads, yet it is known that one patient usually infects 2 to 3 other people, and that the virus is able to survive on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and stainless steel (304), the virus was able to live for up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day and on copper surfaces for up to four hours.
These data, however, vary according to humidity and temperature, with a positive result for COVID-19 in domestic and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first discovered in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases recorded in Wuhan.
All signs of a new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed by domestic soap that dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 has a large resemblance to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to be of zoonous origin.
A genetic analysis of the coronavirus revealed that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, sub-nature of Sarbecovirus (cell line B) in conjunction with two other strains of bat viruses.
At a holistic-genome level, it is 96% identical to other coronavirus samples of bat (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangoline viruses and humans.
An integrative-genome comparison to date has shown that the highest similarity (92 per cent) exists between pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolines are intermediate owners of the virus.
The virus infection can be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this should ultimately be confirmed by a polymerasic chain reaction analysis with reverse transcription (RT-PRC) of a infected secret or computer-based CAT scan.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that the CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease currents.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a first line test method in COVID-19 diagnostics".
WHO published several RNA testing protocols on SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
Real-time polymerosal chain reaction testing (RT-PRC) is under way.
It may be carried out on respiratory samples and on blood samples.
The results are usually available within a period of hours to a few days.
A swab from the nostril is usually used for the test, although a swab from the yawn can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them had proved accurate enough to obtain approval for universal application.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Typical features of visualization of symptoms on X-rays and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetrical peripheral muzzles of the type of matt glass and the absence of pleural spatter.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for the development of an international database of confirmed cases of infection.
Because of similarity to other infections such as adenovirus, when COVID-19 is identified, images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical features.
In China, a major study comparing the results of the thorax CT and PCR testing was carried out, and it was found that although the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be deciphered more quickly; they were also more sensitive, and thus the diagnostic method could be seen as a screening tool in contaminated areas.
In order to diagnose the virus using X-rays and computer tomography, synthetic neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed.
Prevention strategies include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding eyes, nose or mouth contact with dirty hands, and using coughing or sneezing napkins that should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may have already contracted the disease should wear a medical mask in public places.
In order to prevent transmission, it is also recommended to physically distance ourselves from people, and many Governments recommend that no non-urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak should be undertaken and that the movement of citizens should be restricted.
Nevertheless, the virus has been able to spread in most regions of the world.
It is recommended that health-care workers who care for patients who may be infected should use standard precautions and precautions in contact with other people and eye protection, and that contact tracing is also an important method used by the health-care authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the location of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements demanding that this type of surveillance be limited.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups had worked on developing solutions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data, such as recording the user's proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test has been positive, he receives a notification. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection — for example, nose and mouth patching, which is actually ineffective.
To date, there is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working on it.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with heavy hand pollution, as well as before eating, after shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because while outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which opens up its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends the use of sanitizers for alcohol-based hand treatment with alcohol content of at least 60%.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching eyes, noses, or mouths with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with a number of solutions (on the stainless steel surface, the disinfectant starts to operate a minute after application) with 62-71% ethanol, 50-100 % isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% species.
Other components, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorogexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if COVID is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office or day-care facility, all spaces in such a room, including offices, toilets, public spaces, electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control consoles and ATMs used by sick people, should be decontaminated.
Medical organizations recommend that when coughing or sneezing, the mouth and nose should be covered by the back of the elbow or napkin and immediately discarded.
Those who may have been infected are encouraged to use medical masks, since mask use can limit the volume and range of exhalation products that dissipate in the air when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, and touching a face with dirty hands is the main means of infection." Masks are also recommended for use by those caring for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who take care of a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of mask does reduce the number of facial contact.
Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.
CDC Centers, USA, recommend wearing tissue face masks for non-medical purposes. China specifically stressed the importance of using one-time medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 metre (3 ft) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask in public transport or public spaces.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make face masks in the home and to wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going out without masks closing their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, the Vietnamese Government asked all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government has obliged all visitors to grocery stores to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel has also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks per day have been produced since mid-March, medical masks have been prescribed for all passengers on trains and coaches.
In Panama, residents were required to wear a medical mask when they went outside; residents who could not acquire masks were advised to make them themselves at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an infection control measure aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding public places, using uncontacted greetings and physically distanced from others.
Many Governments in the regions particularly affected by the outbreak now prescribe or recommend social distance.
The maximum number of people who can be collected in one place as recommended by U.S. governments and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 (in regions where COVID-19 was not available) to 50 and later to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany prohibited the gathering of more than two people into groups; older persons and those suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system face an increased risk of contracting a serious form of the virus. CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak of the disease in the region. In late March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began replacing the use of the term "social distance" with "physical distance", thus clarifying the purpose of this measure to reduce physical contact within the framework of social relations, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood to mean that people should be subjected to complete social exclusion instead of remaining in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, recommendations were made to have sexual intercourse only with your permanent partners with whom you live, and in whom you are confident that he does not have the virus and its symptoms.
Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are recommended to be self-insulating in the home.
Health-care institutions have issued detailed instructions on proper self-resolvement, and many Governments have also made it mandatory or recommended that the entire population of the affected areas be quarantined themselves.
Persons in high-risk groups were given strict quarantine orders.
Individuals who may have been in contact with those infected with COVID-19 or who have recently visited a country or region heavily affected by the epidemic have been advised to be quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat outbreaks include containment, suppression or mitigation.
The containment of the spread of the disease takes place at an early stage and is aimed at tracing and isolating the infected and involves other measures of infection control and vaccination to halt the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
At a stage when the spread of the disease can no longer be contained, efforts are being directed towards mitigation: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health systems and society.
Measures to control and mitigate the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
The introduction of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of an infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the equalization of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overburdening health services and provide more time to develop vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to deal with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, medical masks and self-insulation; public measures aimed at physical distance such as closing schools and cancelling mass events; community involvement in and participation in such measures; and environmental protection measures such as surface cleaning. After the severity of the outbreak became apparent in China, stronger action was taken to contain the outbreak, such as the isolation of entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries have also adopted a number of measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as an alert system for the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected persons in isolation and heavy fines were imposed on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of medical masks and has been fined for the accumulation of excess stocks of medicines, and modeling for the United Kingdom and the United States has shown that there are serious problems with mitigation (slow but not stop the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (stopping the epidemic's growth).
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the health burden by 2/3 and mortality by double, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Pressure may be the preferred method, but it needs to be used as long as the virus circulates to the population (or until a vaccine is developed, if sooner), because otherwise the spread of the disease will resume rapidly when measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic results in social and economic costs.
Anti-virus drugs approved for COVID-19 treatment do not currently exist, but efforts are under way to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking cold-free drugs, drinking enough fluids, and resting can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may require oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid injection, and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can only harm.
Several compounds previously approved for other virus diseases are also being considered for use for COVID-19 treatment.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic funds” can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and adaptation of health care to patients ' needs from COVID-19 as the primary response to an outbreak of disease.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health-care services to facilitate the reallocation of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, the elimination of non-urgent procedures where possible, the detection of the virus and the isolation of patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as the enhancement of intensive care facilities through training of staff and the increase of the number of IVL and beds available.
There are different theories as to where the very first case of infection could have arisen, the so-called "zero patient".
The first known case of new coronavirus infection probably occurred on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
During the month, the incidence of coronavirus in Hubei province gradually increased.
They were mainly related to the Juanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus has entered the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus is of zoonous origin. On 26 December, Hubei Provincial Clinic recorded a massive case of pneumonia of unknown origin, with which Dr. Zhang Tianjin worked, reporting the case to the Jianghang Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan City on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the central clinic of Wuhan city warned their colleagues of "coronavirus, similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlian, were warned by the police of responsibility for spreading false rumours, and the doctor, Ay Fen, received a reprimand from her superiors for raising panic.
Later, on December 31, Wuhana Municipal Health Commission published a public notice and informed WHO about the situation.
The health authorities of Wuhan reported cases of unknown pneumonia, which proved to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January; in the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, facilitated by China's New Year's holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 new infections in one day, including two people who fell ill in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to later official data, by 20 January 2020, 6,174 people already had symptoms of the disease; as of 26 March, the United States had outperformed China and Italy in the largest number of confirmed infections worldwide; as of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, more than 97,000 had died and over 364,000 had recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one reported case of contamination.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen zone have restricted their freedom of movement and established border controls.
National responses included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory stay at home, mandatory shelter or isolation), as well as curfews. As of 2 April, some 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were in some form of quarantine, more than 50 million were in isolation from the Philippines, some 59 million were in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later that figure increased to 2.6 billion, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report whose reliability was not verified, that date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Jang Jisian was working on a case of massive pneumonia of unknown type, which her clinic notified the Jianghang Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan City on 27 December.
Primary genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on 27 December 2019, revealed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission published a public notice.
WHO was notified the same day.
In response to such notifications, the police warned doctors in Wuhan of responsibility for "dissemination of rumours" about the outbreak.
Initially, China's National Health Commission argued that there was no “clear evidence” of the ability of a newly discovered virus to transmit from person to person.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later named Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping "people's war".
The events of "the largest quarantine in human history" began to unfold, and on 23 January the Sanitary Cordon was announced and the entry ban on Wuhan and vice versa was later extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province and affected a total of some 57 million people.
The city was banned from using personal transport.
In many places, the Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled.
The authorities also announced the construction of the temporary Khushinshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishengshan, was built and received other incoming patients.
In addition to newly constructed hospitals, China has also reassigned 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health reports for travellers and extending the period of the Chinese New Year celebrations.
Universities and schools were closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote working regime.
Travel restrictions have been imposed in Hubei province and beyond.
The schedule for public transport was changed and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
In many cities, a citizen movement control regime was introduced, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of open-air traffic restriction. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine had been introduced in Beijing for all international travellers entering the city; as of 23 March, only one case of internal transmission had been recorded in mainland China, which had occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who had returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, China's Prime Minister Lee Keqiang reported that the spread of internal transmission cases had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been brought under control.
On the same day, travel restrictions to Hubei other than Wuhan were lifted, two months after the province was closed for quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that, as of 28 March, entry for persons holding a visa or residence permit would be suspended.
Those wishing to come to China would have to apply for a visa from Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on businesses and factories to resume work and provided companies with monetary stimulus packages. On 4 April, a national three-minute “minute silence” was held at 10:00, which opened the day of mourning for the victims of coronavirus, announced by the National Council of State and coinciding with the Queenmin holiday, but the central government asked citizens to pay tribute to the dead online while exercising physical distance to avoid a recurrence of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji in Tegu.
The followers of Shincheongji came to Tegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, out of 9,336 church followers 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported having symptoms of illness. On 23 February 2020, South Korea announced the highest level of anxiety.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were recorded in Korea, and as of 29 February this number had risen to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers were tested to have a virus.
The outbreak has affected the number of travels, hence the scheduling of airlines has been changed; South Korea has launched a screening programme for the presence of the virus, tracking contacts and organizing quarantine measures for contact persons, which is considered to be the largest and best of its organization worldwide.
Screening methods included mandatory communication of symptoms through a mobile application by all visitors from abroad, a routine virus test that was ready the following day, and increased testing capabilities that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's program is considered successful in combating the outbreak of the disease despite the fact that entire cities were not isolated there, and originally South Korean society was divided due to President Moon Jae-in's reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for what they believed to be the Government ' s response to the outbreak of disease.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of infections in one day within four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad would be placed on a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea sought help in testing for the virus in 121 countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kuma, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Health Education, two people died later that day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sports events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, institutions of higher education and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to restrict intercity travel were announced in March, but intensive city-to-city movements continued before the Persian New Year.
Shiite shrines in Kum remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center for the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the backdrop of allegations of concealment of the outbreak in Iran, by 28 February more than 10 countries had linked their cases to Iran, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak there could be more serious than the 388 reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members reportedly had positive results of testing for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as to release temporarily all prisoners suitable for this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths within one day, the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By March 23, 50 new cases of coronavirus were recorded in Iran every hour and one new death from coronavirus every ten minutes.
According to the WHO representative, Iran ' s prevalence rate could be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
It is also suggested that US sanctions against Iran may affect the country's financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded the easing of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease had entered Italian territory when two Chinese tourists tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome had a positive result.
The number of cases of infection has increased rapidly, prompting the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
A non-associated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered, starting with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were quarantined.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said "entry into and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.
In these areas, it has already been ordered to suspend businesses and cancel sports activities.” On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, as 100 people had already died in Italy at that time.
All major sports events, including A-series football matches, were scheduled to take place behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March all sports events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Therapy (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols for setting priorities for patients to receive medical care, which may have to be used.
On March 19, Italy surpassed China in the mortality rate from coronavirus, ranking first in the world, following the announcement of 3,405 deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed coronavirus infections in Italy, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovery cases, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report notes that a combination of two factors can contribute to this high mortality rate in Italy: the large number of elderly citizens in that country and the lack of capacity to examine all those currently suffering from coronavirus.
The United Kingdom had responded to the virus in the calmest of all affected countries, and until 18 March 2020 the British Government had not obliged citizens to observe any form of social distance or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not reacting quickly enough and seriously to the danger faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all travel and social contacts, which were not of paramount importance, should be avoided, inviting people to work from home whenever possible and to avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay up to 80% of their wages, but not more than £2,500 per month, as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distance measures, prohibiting more than two people from gathering and limiting travel and active outdoor rest to cases of extreme necessity only.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed by the police, fines and crowds.
Most businesses were ordered to close down, except those that provide “life-saving activities” including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages.
On January 20, in the Pacific Northwestern State of Washington, a man who returned from Wuhan on January 15 was confirmed to have the first COVID-19 case in the country.
On 29 January, a Coronavirus Task Force was established in the White House.
On 31 January, the Trump administration declared a state of emergency in the public health sector and imposed entry restrictions for visitors from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, a leading U.S. government public health organization, announced that it had developed its own testing kit.
Despite this, testing of the population in the United States was not initiated immediately and the true scale of the disease during this period was concealed.
Testing was hampered by the marriage of test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, the absence of federal government authorization by the end of February to use non-State test kits developed by academic organizations, various companies and clinics, and restrictive criteria until early March that would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only be done by the appointment of a medical doctor).
The Washington Post reported that by 27 February less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
The Atlantic reported that by March 13, less than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many patients, even with symptoms and appointments to a doctor, were waiting their turn for tests for hours or days." Following a report from the state of Washington on February 29 about the first death by coronavirus in the United States, Governor Jay Insley declared a state of emergency, which was also soon announced by other states.
On March 3, Seattle schools cancelled classes, and by mid-March schools closed throughout the country. On March 6, 2020, a group of Imperial College epidemiologists, London, informed the United States of projections of the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Additional Funding for Preparedness and Response against Coronavirus Act, under which emergency assistance of $8.3 billion was provided to the federal authorities to respond to the outbreak of the disease.
Corporations imposed travel restrictions on staff, cancelled conferences and encouraged staff to work from home.
Sports events and seasons were cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions to most of Europe, except the UK, for 30 days starting on March 13.
The following day, he extended the restrictions to include Great Britain and Ireland as well.
On 13 March, the President declared a state of emergency in the country, allowing for the use of federal means to deal with the crisis.
Beginning on March 15, many companies began closing or reducing working hours throughout the United States, assisting in the fight against the spread of the virus.
By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. On 23 March, it was reported that 10,700 cases per day had been reported in New York City, exceeding the total number of cases in South Korea.
On 25 March, the Governor said that social distance was probably an effective measure, as estimates of doubling the number of cases fell from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As at 28 March, 32,308 cases had been reported in New York City and 672 persons had died. On 26 March, more confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As at 8 April, 400,335 cases had been confirmed in the United States of America, 12,841 had died.
According to media reports dated 30 March, President Trump decided to extend the period of social distance until 30 April.
On the same day, a USNS Comfort hospital ship docked at the port of New York City for 1,000 beds.
On April 3, 884 coronavirus deaths were recorded in the United States within 24 hours.
In the State of New York, as of 3 April, the number of cases exceeded 100,000, and the White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring publicly available information through the Office of Vice President Mike Pence public statements and publications by health officials and scientists related to the virus.
On the whole, the supporters of President Trump have divided their views on how successful he is in dealing with the crisis.
Some officials and observers have criticized US dependence on imports of essential materials, including essentials, from China.
In mid-January 2020, Travel Medicine published an analysis of air travel patterns, which was used to map and predict the spread of the disease.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association in 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei hosted the largest number of travelers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali was identified as the least prepared for an outbreak of disease, while Australian cities are considered the most prepared. On February 7, Australia adopted its new coronavirus emergency plan (COVID-19).
In this regard, it is stated that much remains to be learned about COVID-19 and that Australia will focus on border control and communications in a threat situation.
On 21 March, a human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia.
Thanks to the effective quarantine measures applied in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries planned to evacuate their nationals and diplomatic personnel from the area, mainly through charter flights of their home countries, to which the Chinese authorities had granted their authorization.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first to plan to evacuate their nationals.
Pakistan stated that it did not intend to evacuate citizens from China.
On 7 February, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians/Brazilian relatives, as well as four Poles, a Chinese and an Indian citizen.

On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate U.S. nationals aboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner.
On 21 February, a plane with 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian government began to evacuate its nationals from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airways aircraft chartered by the South African government flew with 112 South African nationals on board.
Prior to the flight, a medical examination of passengers was conducted, and four South Africans who were found to have coronavirus were left in China to reduce risk.
Only South Africans with negative coronavirus tests were evacuated.
The analyses were taken from all South African citizens, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, and they all remained under surveillance as a precautionary measure and were quarantined for 14 days in The Ranch Resort.
On March 20, the US began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq in response to the pandemic.

On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced that it was going to send $2.26 million worth of aid to China.
Japan has also donated one million medical masks to Wuhan, Turkey has sent medical equipment there, Russia has more than 13 tons of medicines, Malaysia has announced the donation of 18 million medical gloves, Germany has sent various medical supplies including 10,000 protective kits, the United States has donated 17.8 tons of medicines, and has pledged $100 million in financial support to affected countries.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medicines and experts to Italy to help the population cope with the coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the organization to distribute them to its member States.
Later, he also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks and 5 IVL machines to Panama.
Ma also donated medicines to Canada, the Czech Republic, Georgia, the Netherlands, Spain and Turkey expressing concern about medical masks and testing kits for Chinese production.
Spain, for example, withdrew 58,000 Chinese coronavirus test kits, which provide only up to 30 per cent accuracy, and the Netherlands withdrew 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also withdrew 100,000 unusable medical masks: they were supposed to have been manufactured in China, but subsequently turned out to be from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and control the spread of infection.
WHO noted clear differences between the situation with the outbreak of atypical pneumonia in 2002–04, in which the Chinese authorities were accused of secreting information, which allegedly hindered the prevention and control of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government “regularly provided updated information on the situation to avoid panic on the eve of China's New Year”.
On 23 January, in response to a decision by the central authorities to impose a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Goden Galea noted that, while “this measure was definitely recommended by WHO”, it was also “a very important reaffirmation of the commitment to contain the epidemic at the most common location” and called it “unprecedented in public health history.” On 30 January, after the ability of infection to be transmitted from person to person outside China and the increase in the number of infected countries, WHO declared an emergency in the international public health system (PHEIC); this situation was the sixth since 2009, when it was first applied during the swine flu pandemic.
The WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adanom, said that the PHEIC announcement was due to “a global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures that unduly hinder international movements and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the global community to provide $675 million for strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need to provide urgent assistance to countries that “do not have systems to identify people infected by the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “our readiness is the degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest link”, and called on the international community to “make choices: invest today or pay in the future.” At a press conference on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide "the capacity of the entire UN system in response to the problem".
As a result, a UN Crisis Management Group was established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, WHO states, will “focus on the health response, while other agencies can use their expertise to address the disease outbreak from a broader social and economic perspective”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint ad hoc group, which ensured the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in resolving the situation within the country and to assess the “seriousness and contagiousness of the disease”, organized seminars and meetings with key national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of the response at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas.” On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that “it is too early to call the pandemic, but countries must nevertheless be prepared to do so”.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the probability of global coronavirus proliferation would be increased from “high” to “very high” — the highest degree of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO health emergency programme, warned in his statement: "It's a test of every government on the planet to be ready for reality: the time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared," and stressed that the right response can help the world avoid a "worst scenario."
Ryan also stated that current data did not warrant the proclamation of a global pandemic by public health officials, and added that the announcement of the pandemic would mean that "we essentially recognize the fact that every human being on the planet would be at risk of contracting the virus."
On March 11, WHO announced a pandemic coronavirus outbreak.
The WHO Director-General stated that WHO is “deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction on this issue.” WHO is seriously criticized for its perceived inadequate approach to the notion of the pandemic, including the late announcement of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
In response to this situation, a petition was filed with the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, inviting him to resign, which had been signed by 733,000 persons as of 6 April.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to life-saving measures against him and that the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
The experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older citizens, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of public support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and recommendations.
The digital hub provides information on the policy actions of different countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote a coordinated global response to coronavirus.
The Chinese Government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gow and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonar, for taking action to combat the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) provincial level were dismissed for their quarantine measures in central China, and these dismissals indicated dissatisfaction with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the coronavirus outbreak had begun in Wuhan, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had originated in the United States or Italy.
The administration of US President Donald Trump called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Whanya virus", stating that "censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus, which has now become a global pandemic", and this statement has in turn been criticized by some commentators who argue that such an approach is racist and "restrains from the US President's failure to contain the spread of the disease."
The Daily Beast gained access to the U.S. government telegram, which contains a communications strategic trick, apparently coined by the National Security Council, with such references to strategy: “The whole case in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television performances." Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg stated that China's efforts to help countries affected by the virus are part of a “promotional push” to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy director Josep Borrell warned of the presence of a "geo-political component that includes the struggle for influence through the PR and the so-called policy of generosity".
Borrell also stated that "China insists on promoting its role as a responsible and reliable partner, as opposed to the US".
China also called on the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, reportedly sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned in connection with the United States sanctions imposed on April 3.
US authorities are also accused of redirecting aid destined for other countries to their own country.
There was also controversy over medical masks among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of IVL vehicles destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of support for coronavirus-affected Italy.
Mauricio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that "China alone has responded bilaterally.
This is clearly not a sign of European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the dispatch to Italy of Russian military ambulances, specialized disinfection transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous "high-level political source", claiming that 80% of Russian aid was "unuseful or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favourable impression on world public opinion at the "geopolitical and diplomatic" level.
Lombardia President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mayo rejected the media attacks and expressed gratitude for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that "in offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase production rates, they will also be able to respond if necessary."
NATO's Protector 2020 military exercises, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries — NATO's most large-scale military exercises after the end of the cold war — will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized Defender 2020 (Protector 2020): "In a public health crisis today, the conduct of these exercises endangers not only the U.S. military and many European participating countries, but also the inhabitants of the countries where such events are to take place." The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus. About two dozen MPs, as well as fifteen other current or former politicians, have been infected.
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, in an open letter, requested the assistance of world leaders, reporting that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets owing to the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic gave rise to calls for the United States to adopt social policies prevalent in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a unified health and child care system, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Political scientists expected that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election, and the pandemic has made diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worse.
South Korea criticized Japan's "controversial and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen coming from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine in government-designated locations.
South Korean society was initially divided due to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the President ' s actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for what they considered to be the Government ' s inadequate response to the outbreak of disease; the pandemic forced countries to enact emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this step will enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Victor Orban the indefinite right to rule through decrees, suspend Parliament, and hold elections and punish those accused of spreading fake information about the virus and government responses to the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak was cited as causing several shortfalls in supply due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods in a panic environment, and disruptions in production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruptions in suppliers' performance.
Panic purchases have also occurred in several localities, leading to the disappearance of essential goods such as food, toilet paper and bottled water from the store shelves, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100fold.
This surge resulted in a 20-fold increase in prices over the normal price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It has also caused a lack of personal protection throughout the world, and WHO has warned that health workers will be hit for this reason.
In Australia, owing to the pandemic, daigow buyers have been given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
These activities have led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and have since been banned by the Australian Government, despite the high incidence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, both areas have avoided severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and illegal trade in critical products, which proved successful, avoided the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant declines, but the industry is of the view that agricultural prices may rise.
The shelves of food stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the town of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to porcine stocks in order to provide adequate food to the population.
Similar laws require food producers to preserve food supplies in case of emergency, as well, in Italy.
The damage to the world economy has affected China: according to media reports from 16 March, China’s economy was badly affected in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to combat the spread of the virus, which have resulted in a 20.5% decline in retail sales.
Mainland China is a major economic and production centre; therefore, the virus outbreak is considered to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agatha Demaray, a member of the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that market volatility will remain until there is a clearer understanding of potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic on global growth could surpass the effects of the 2002–2004 SARS epidemic.
According to an expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis, damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have taken “urgent measures” following a sharp drop in oil prices due to the fall in demand from China.
On 24 February, world stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected by COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to growing fears of a coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and Dow-Jones' index for industrial equity, showed the sharpest decline since 2008, with Dow's index falling by 1,191 points, the largest one-day fall since the financial crisis of 2007-2008.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10% drop.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The shares fell again due to concerns about the distribution of coronavirus, and the largest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a possibility of economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks are reacting faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors with regard to travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of Governments not to undertake any travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in the demand for airline tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has proved to be stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of the Chinese New Year's celebrations.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of large-scale events, including annual New Year festivals; private companies also closed their own shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands.
Many New Year's events were cancelled and tourist attractions closed to prevent mass crowds of people; for example, the Forbidden City was closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs were abolished.
In 24 of China ' s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the New Year ' s Holiday until 10 February, directing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling the New Year's celebrations. The retail sector has suffered globally: shop hours have been reduced and some stores have been temporarily closed.
Attendance at retail outlets in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Retail businesses in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March, the attendance of malls fell by 33 to 43 per cent compared to February.
Trade centre operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of visiting temperature testing equipment and cancellation of activities: the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimates that a recession in Latin America caused by a pandemic could leave 14 to 22 million more people out of poverty than would have been the case, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, in the midst of the Wuhan epidemic, some 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China ' s 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves at home in their country ' s provinces or locked up in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought assistance from the Government.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, the outbreak of coronavirus could deprive 47 million people of their jobs and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent; self-immunization measures imposed in India would leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers in receipt of daily pay; a study by the Angus Reid Institute had shown that 44 per cent of Canadian households had experienced unemployment in one way or another; almost 900,000 Spanish workers had also lost jobs since the imposition of severe isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit, almost half a million companies in Germany transferred their employees to government-subsidized reduced working hours, part-time.
The German part-time wage scheme was also introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The arts and cultural heritage were also severely affected by the pandemic, which affected organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (often State-funded) mission of ensuring access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and, where possible, supporting art people.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed down for an indefinite period around the world, or access to them had been restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances had been cancelled or moved to other dates.
Other recent and growing effects of the virus are the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered setbacks, with the Vatican announcing the cancellation of the Good Week events in Rome, which are held during the last week of the Christian Repentance Period, the Great Post.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live or television, while some church leaders offer open - air services.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims no longer appear, and later other religious organizations also abolished worship and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gourdvares.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and its own residents from accessing the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or rescheduled, including the UEFA Champions League 2019–20, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019–20 season, and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The coronavirus outbreak also destroyed plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to start in late July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "post-2020 but no later than summer 2021." Casino and other gambling institutions around the world were closed, and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast live, were also either rescheduled or cancelled.
This has led many players to go online and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway, also cancelled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have begun to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results over the Internet, organizing live broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this helps people of creative professions to continue to perform, produce or publish their works.
There have been many Internet memes on the subject of coronavirus, many of which are humorous and soften the anxiety surrounding periods of uncertainty.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism against Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
The February information reports (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly earned the virus or received fair retribution for something.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has also increased in some African countries.
Many Uhan and Hubei residents reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese citizens, as well as those living in virus-affected areas, were supported in both offline and online mode.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, particularly in Italy, the first country in Europe to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, citizens of such regions may also begin to feel the influence of suspicion and xenophobia; citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed an early petition, insisting that Chinese citizens be prohibited from entering their countries in order to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#Chinese Do Not Come Japan) was a leading Twitterer.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report a growing level of racism and even attacks.
US President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus"; critics consider this opinion racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan to the New Sanjars.
Students coming from northeastern India bordering China and studying in major cities in India reported persecutions associated with a coronavirus outbreak.
Dileep Ghosh, President of the State Unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, West Bengal, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "so God avenged him."
These remarks were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called them "misleading." In China, the pandemic once again sparked xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents: foreigners became called "foreign garbage" and objects subject to "recycling".
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles on the coronavirus outbreak publicly available.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to their research results on the Preprint publication servers, such as bioRxiv.

The smuggling of wild animals and diseases transmitted from animals to humans are health risks associated with the trading of exotic animals.
Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is only designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
Antibodies detection (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population control purposes.
Antibodies tests reveal the number of people who suffered the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to be treated in hospital or were not at all available.
The exact death rate from the disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined from the results of the test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests carried out in different countries was very controversial.
Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be greatly exaggerated.
With the polymerasic chain reaction of real-time inverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on airway samples obtained in various ways, including a swab from the nostril or a sample of wetting.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
The oth-PCR test performed on swabs taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.
The virus may later disappear from the throat, nevertheless continuing to reproduce in the lungs.
Infected patients tested in the second week of the disease may alternatively take material from the lower respiratory tract with the help of a suction catheter, or use snorting (mocrot) products.
One of the early tests of the PCR was developed at the Charith Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a polymerasic chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 sets subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-level SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It identifies the gene "E", common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the gene RdRp specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain permission from China's National Drug Administration for the emergency use of the kit to detect SARS-CoV-2 based on the PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their diagnostic panel through the International Reagent Resource to conduct the RT-PCR in real time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from older versions of test sets gave incomplete results due to defective reagents and a narrow testing area conducted by CDC in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples per day were successfully handled on average throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was only after that date that public and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency use permit. US commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 contamination based on the RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics began testing on COVID-19 nationwide from March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been reported; the extraction and processing of the analyses must be in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR State Centre for virology and biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Supervision Service. It was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to use a test that could be conducted for 3.5 hours on a large volume of samples, allowing one car to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency application permit (EUA) to Abbott laboratories to test the Abbott m2000 system; formerly the FDA issued a similar permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives the EUA from the FDA for a test lasting about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test using amplification technology for insulated nucleic acids instead of the PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, the method can detect positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is currently developing a monoclonal antibodies test that is specifically linked to the new coronavirus (N-protein) nucleo-pasid protein, and there is hope that results can be obtained in 15-20 minutes, like a rapid flu test.
A March 2020 review of specialized literature concluded that "the chest's thorax transcripts have a small diagnostic value at early stages, while the results of the CT [computer tomography] may have that value even before symptoms appear."
Typical features identified during the CT include two-way long subpleural compaction tricks of the "mat glass" type with peripheral, asymmetrical, and aposterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of a rock bridge, and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
A study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that the CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation "not to use CT for screening or as a first line test method in COVID-19 diagnostics". As of March 2020, the PCR method is recommended for initial CDC screening.
The partial immune response to the infection is expressed in the development of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after day 7, to define immunity, and to perform population monitoring.
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed at which each system is produced.
CLT usually uses one sample of peripheral blood, although serial samples may also be used to monitor the immune response.
At PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by punctured skin cover.
Unlike the PCR methods, the blood withdrawal phase is not required for sampling. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all the necessary registration procedures and can now extend their tests to antibodies.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA had approved only one emergency application test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were granted European permits to use their test sets, which can be detected in IgG and IgA blood samples that have the ability to control the virus.
The test performance is several hundred samples over a few hours and therefore the method works much faster than the normal PCR analysis of the viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after infection, and in early April the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it acquired yielded satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspicion of the virus to stay at home: "Emergency department staff deliver a sample sample probe to the patient", the patient spits in, gives back and receives test results some time later. British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot home-based screening of suspicious cases, which eliminates the risk of infection by a patient of other clinic visitors, or the need to decontaminate an ambulance if it was used to transport the patient. During the rapid test of COVID-19 in suspicious cases, a medical officer takes an analysis using all appropriate precautions.
Express testing centres helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures in any other country. On 2 March, in Germany, the National Association of Physicians of Compulsory Health Insurance stated that it was willing to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient conditions, and a week earlier they had been able to do only 10,700 tests per week.
If the examination is appointed by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's total test performance is 160,000 tests a week.
As of 19 March, rapid testing had been proposed in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests taken in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of calendar week, 12/2020 at SARS-CoV-2 had taken at least 483,295 samples, up to the week 12/2020, inclusive, and 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) of the results were positive.The researchers at the Israeli Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested the simultaneous test method for samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further tests only if the combined sample showed a positive result. In Wuhan, on February 5, 2020, BGI opened a 2,000 square metres temporary emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese or "Fire Eye"), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
The construction of the laboratory was organized by BGI founder Wang Jiang and completed in only 5 days; modelling showed that if the laboratory had not been put into service at this accelerated rate, Hubei's incidence would have been 47 per cent higher, and therefore quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
Following the opening of the laboratory in Wuhan, Huo-yang laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai were opened immediately, in a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day, and open multiplex Origami Assays schemes were released that can test up to 1,122 patient tests per COVID19 using only 93 test tubes. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, excluding the use of robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, owing to a shortage and insufficient number of reagents, mass testing in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States had become problematic.
As a result, some authors have turned to test sample processing protocols, which provide for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the volume of coronavirus testing currently conducted by the United Arab Emirates per capita was higher than that of any other country, and most of the population would soon be tested.
This was due to rapid testing opportunities, along with the acquisition of mass testing laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (established through their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
This laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first laboratory of such a large scale, operating outside China.
Various testing options aimed at different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of test kits, which are sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States health centres was unavailable until 28 January, resulting in a lack of test kits in the United States; the initial outbreak in China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient sets recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, however, experts argue that the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has worked to provide testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the development of testing programmes as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increased demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many United States private laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of test samples, were overburdened and swabs and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
American test kits developed by CDC had "deficits", and for this reason the government removed bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing development. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these sets were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the inaccuracy of the results could be due to poor sampling or misuse of the sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would withdraw inaccurate-performance kits and replace them with other sets — the Shenzhen Bioeasy sets. 80% of the test sets that the Czech Republic had acquired in China had produced incorrect results. 1.2 million test sets purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovich proposed to drop them into the Danube. Atesh Kara, an official of the Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had a "high level of error" and the Ministry "did not use them." Britain purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was declared unfit for use.
Quarantine measures for those whose analyses had yielded positive results at SARS-CoV-2, as well as surveillance of people with whom such patients had been in contact, had had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaud, where a COVID-19 man died for the first time in Italy, conducted two testing cycles for the total population of about 3,400 at about 10 days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.
The entry into the locality was closed and this measure completely halted the spread of the infection.
With intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less tense than in other developed countries and no extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and shops had to be imposed.
Many events were cancelled there, and on 28 March Singapore began to urge residents to stay at home, but schools that ended on 23 March opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also coped with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, but restrictions have been less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were conducted than the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because those countries were able to identify more patients with weak or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and the first ten negative test results to COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO testing laboratories for validation testing.
Of these 16 control laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the next graph, the percentage of positive results in the column depends on the country-specific testing policy.
A country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result as a percentage compared to a country in which all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of symptoms of the virus, under equal conditions.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is a process of cleaning up hands to remove pollution, fat, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal oral way.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or common cold, for example if he touches eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous sheaths) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, followed by washing hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the buttocks of the child or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before feeding the child, before eating, and before and after cooking or treating raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleansed with ash.
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after a sick person's care.
After changing diapers or washing a baby who went to the bathroom.
After snorting, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or animal waste.
The medical hygiene of the hands refers to hygienic actions related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing diseases) as well as chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are engaged in cooking or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all other people.
Handwashing is very healthy: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious forms of diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study found that better handwashing can lead to a slight acceleration of the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by learning simple habits such as hand-washing with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders of the benefits of handwashing can reduce diarrhoea by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing clean water to low-income regions.
A 48 per cent reduction in diarrhoea can be related to hand-washing with soap. Hand-washing with soap is the only most effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (ARIs), provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, in schools and in other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of the ORI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, which kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia in general kill nearly 3.5 million children each year.
The United Nations Children's Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after the toilet, which has become a solid habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention and reduce diarrhea mortality by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation activities under water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Handwashing also prevents the emergence of impechism, a disease that is transmitted in direct physical contact.
A slight negative consequence of frequent handwashing is that it can result in skin drying and, in fact, damage to the skin.
A 2012 Danish study showed that too much handwashing can lead to tooth and skin mutilation – a disease known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often handwashing can also be considered a symptom of OCD.
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when hand-washing with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (wetting, defecation), after washing the baby's buttocks (dip change), before feeding the child, before eating, and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent transmission: before or after cutting or wound, after sneezing, coughing or shrivelling, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand-washing with soap is rather rare.
A study on handwashing conducted in 54 countries in 2015 showed that, on average, 38.7 per cent of families had hand-washing with soap as a common practice. 2014 research showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 per cent; the United States was closer to mid-point, at 77 per cent; China had the lowest rate of 23 per cent. There were currently several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing the habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations. In developing countries, group handwashing in schoolchildren at the scheduled time of the day was one of those methodologies that helped to train children in such a procedure.
The “Emergency Health Care Program” implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of large-scale interventions to improve children's health and education.
The national programme is based on deworming, which takes place twice a year, as well as daily soap-washing and daily tooth cleaning with fluorine.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from skin cover is more effective if soap or detergents are added during the washing process.
The main action of soap and detergents is to remove and increase solubility barriers.
Water in itself is not considered an effective means of skin purification, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic pollution, are poorly dissolved in water.
Sufficient water, however, contributes to the process of purification.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, may also contain bacteria that may reach it in previous use.
A small number of studies on the impact on the skin of bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid soap indicate a low probability of such an impact, as bacteria are washed away with foam.
The CDC still argues that "liquid soap with hand dosage is the preferred option for washing hands."
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in communities caring for their health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectants has selective effects on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics in their nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosane, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be consistent with the advertised.
In addition to surfactant and skin protection, complex compounds may contain acids (acoustic, achestin, milk) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoid acid and other excreta (loe faith, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the University of Oregon Public Health School has shown that, in terms of disease prevention and removal of bacteria from the skin, simple soap varieties are as effective as conventional antibacterial soap containing triclosane.
Hot water, comfortable with human skin temperature, is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria reproduce much faster at a body temperature of 37 °C.
However, warm soap water is more effective than cold water to remove natural fats that contain contamination and bacteria.
Contrary to popular opinion, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial stress on the hands.
Hand sanitizer (sanitizer) or hand antiseptic is a hand-sanitizer that contains no water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand hygiene products (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectors, antiseptic agents for hand disinfection or sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these products are made of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of clotters such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel, or humidifiers such as liquid or foam glycerine, making the use of these products convenient and reducing the effect of alcohol drying the skin.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity; disinfectants containing a minimum of 60-95 per cent alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multiple drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), a tuberculosis wand, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
The disinfectants, which contain 70% alcohol, kill 99.97 percent of bacteria (a reduction log of 3.5 similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.99% of bacteria (a reduction log of 4–5) on hands one minute after application. The disinfectants for the hands are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against viruses of the type norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol-containing means must be used to thoroughly process and impregnate the skin of the hands on both sides.
The face and rear surface of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers, shall be rubbed throughout the length for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.
The fingertips of both arms should also be carefully washed, and the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends choosing to wash hands rather than using disinfectants, especially if the hands are heavily polluted.
The increased popularity of such disinfectants is due to their simple use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for full-scale hand-washing if water and soap are available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants can cause skin dryness if their composition does not contain softening agents and (or) skin humidifiers.
The effect of skin drying in alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other mitigating substances to the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing softening components caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hive syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually non-existent.
The lower probability of irritating contact dermatitis was a factor in the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite their efficiency, water-free means do not cleanse their hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand disinfectants are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as conventional soap and water, since when such devices are used, pathogenic microorganisms are still on hand.
The effectiveness of the decontamination agent for alcohol-free hands depends to a large extent on components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than in alcohol or alcohol-containing products.
More recently, it has been proven that the drugs using benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to be ineffective after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin side reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.
Zola or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the Centers for Disease Control in the United States recommend the use of hand-washing techniques, which include the following steps:
Rinse your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that running water, because standing water may be contaminated, but the temperature of the water does not matter.
Wash your hands with a lot of soap, including the back of your hands, as well as the areas between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes microbes from the skin, and studies show that when using soap (not just one water), people tend to wash their hands more carefully.
Triple your hands for at least 20 seconds.
The friction helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you rub your hands, the more germs are removed.
Carefully wash your hands under the running water.
Handwashing in standing water can cause re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry themselves.
Wet and wet hands are more easily polluted, most often people neglect areas such as thumb, wrist, finger and nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that wetting lotion be used to prevent skin drying, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different low-cost ways of washing hands: pouring water out of a hanging canister or bottled pumpkin with holes produced and (or) using ash, if necessary, as in developing countries; and in places with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are water-saving solutions such as foot pedal taps and other low-cost options.
The foot pedal tap is a simple structure consisting of a vessel suspended on a rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to pour water on the hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there are some disputes over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The increasing volume of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers, which are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Laptops and Swallows, the subject of which was a comparison of the hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern hand dryers streaming air.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a warm air dryer, the total amount of bacteria on the fingertips increased by an average of 194 per cent and on the palms by 254%.
It has also been found that after washing and drying hands in an airflow dryer, the total amount of bacteria on the fingertips increases by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips decreases to an average of 76 per cent and on the palms to 77 per cent. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several visitors to toilet rooms and toilet environments at each type of drying.
A jet-air dryer, which releases air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms off hands and from its own block and potentially infecting other toilet and toilet users within a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms within a radius of 0.25 metres from the dryer.
In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to assess various methods of hand drying.
The following changes are observed in the number of bacteria depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different hand dryers manufacturers, and hand dryers are compared to dry paper towels.
Hand cleaning using disinfectant napkins can be an alternative during travels without soap and water.
The alcohol-based hand disinfectant shall contain at least 60 per cent alcohol.
The medical way of washing hands became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignatz Zemmelweiss discovered its high efficiency (1846) in preventing disease in fixed conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget to do so.
According to one study, the use of such devices does help to reduce the level of infection.
The medical washing of the hands lasts for at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully rubbed against each other, crossing fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water present on their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
A paper towel should be used after drying of the hands, closing the tap and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors.
This prevents the re-pollution of the hands from these surfaces.
The aim of handwashing in health facilities is to remove pathogens ("microbes") and prevent their spread.
New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing procedures remain unacceptable in most health facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, the correct washing of hands and other elementary procedures can reduce blood flow infections associated with the use of catheter by 66 per cent; the World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting the standard procedure for washing and processing hands, which is to be applied in the health sector.
The draft WHO manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open to public discussion.
A review was carried out by Whitby as co-author.
Commercial devices may be used for measuring performance and checking the hygiene of the hands if proof of compliance with regulatory requirements is required.
The World Health Organization refers to “five moments” when it is necessary to wash hands:
After contact with blood or biological fluids,
before the use of anti-septic, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap in hand washing ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soap) helps destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in an environment with a high body content resistant to antibiotics. To "clean" the hands before surgery requires a tap that can be turned on and off without touching its hands; and some chlorogexidine or iodine water should be used for handwashing, sterile hand drying towels after washing, a sterile friction brush, and another sterile instrument for cleaning under nails.
All jewelry must be taken off.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to rub your hands for too long, like 10 minutes.
During the striping, the water with the forearm should not fall back on the hands.
After the washing is completed, the hands dry with sterile cloth and wear a surgical robe.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after care procedures.
To combat staph infection in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent of washing hands were most beneficial, and that very little additional benefit was gained when the frequency of washing hands was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared with antibacterial soap, washing hands with regular soap results in more than three times the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. Comparison of hand washing with alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, on average, 30 seconds per procedure, showed that treatment of hands with alcohol-containing solution reduced bacterial pollution by 26 per cent compared with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than hand alcohol solutions in reducing the amount of influenza A H1N1 virus on the hands and the Clostridium Difectile argument.
Further research is required on the most effective measures in the various health facilities.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is considered to be cost-effective and an important means of improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of stable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to instil the habit of regular washing of hands.
For example, in most rural parts of Africa, hand-washing taps are far from available in every private or public toilet, although there are also cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.
However, poor hand hygiene can also be caused by entrenched habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging hand-washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to long-term changes in public behaviour.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results should be monitored and evaluated.
A systematic analysis of 70 studies found that, in order to improve the hygiene situation of hands in countries with incomes below average, community-based health and epidemiological surveillance is effective, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of advocacy for handwashing in schools is the “Three Star Approach” approach of the United Nations Children's Fund: it promotes simple cost-effective measures in schools to encourage students to wash hands using soap, as well as other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can raise their levels from one to three stars.
The installation of handguns is one of the possible measures implemented in the framework of information campaigns on hand hygiene with a view to reducing morbidity and child mortality.
Global Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of emojis that symbolize handwashing.
Some studies have examined the overall effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries compared to DALYs (the years of life without disability preserved).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand-washing with soap is a much more economical solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of handwashing for human health — especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweiss (Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English nurse and "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten smells called miasma.
In the 1980s, in response to outbreaks of diseases transmitted through the digestive tract and infections related to medical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States became more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with "right handwashing techniques" were mounted near handwashers in public toilets as well as in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “to wash hands” means to demonstrate its unwillingness to accept responsibility for anything or to be a party to something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "died his hands" when deciding on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; this phrase subsequently gained wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth play, Lady Macbeth begins to unwittingly wash her hands in an attempt to purify herself from an imaginary stain that symbolizes an unclean conscience, in connection with the crimes that she herself committed and prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people who remember or have witnessed any unethical act tend to wash their hands more often than others, and for them handmaidens are more important.
It is also less likely that people who have been able to wash their hands after seeing it will be involved in any other "cleaning" compensatory activities, such as volunteer activities.
In religions, handwashing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic handwashing by water, but without soap, is part of a ritual envisaged in many religions, including Baha'i, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hygiene washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam prescribe the obligatory washing of hands after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
COVID-19 control of production factors
The monitoring of production factors in relation to COVID-19 implies the application of occupational safety and health techniques to control risk and control coronaviruses of 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk control depends on the location and work task, based on risk assessment, community severity of the epidemic and risk factors for individual workers that may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) reported that jobs with a lower level of risk had minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures were required to combat infection, including handwashing, encouraging workers to stay at home for signs of illness, observing respiratory etiquette, and conducting daily cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Middle-risk jobs require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis but are likely to be infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
This category may include workers in contact with the public, for example in schools, working environments with high population density and in some large retail shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilating using high-efficiency air filters, the use of shielding and accessible personal protection in the event of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that medical and mortuary personnel who contact a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are considered to be high-risk, with the risk increasing to very high in the course of procedures involving aerosol formation or collecting/processing human samples with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such personnel include the use of engineering and security equipment, such as negative-pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task involved.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have various effects in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to care for others or fear of infection.
Commercial templates may change for both the types of goods for which there is demand and the manner in which such goods are purchased (e.g. purchases in non-peak periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the vehicle).
Finally, there may be disruptions in the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19.
The plans address the risks associated with various jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors at home and in communities, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic diseases.
The plans also specify the controls needed to address such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or state-level advice.
Some of the goals for responding to the epidemic are: to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, to protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, to maintain business operations and to minimize negative effects on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses are affected by the severity of the disease in the community where the business is located.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a framework that is widely used in occupational safety and health to organize such tools according to efficiency.
If the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective safety equipment is engineering, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protective devices.
Engineering safety means that staff members are isolated from work-related risk areas and do not rely on the behaviour of the employee, which can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in labour policies or procedures requiring action by an employee or staff member.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help to address certain risks.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected according to the danger to the employee, be of a size (e.g. respirators), be used continuously and properly, be regularly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and be correctly filmed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Office of Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) believes that jobs with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic responses to the epidemic, recommended for all workplaces, include frequent and thorough hand-washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, adherence to respiratory etiquette, including mouth-covering with cough and sneeze, provision of napkins and garbage containers, readiness for remote or shift work, where appropriate, guidance for workers avoiding the use of other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and decontamination of the workplace.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected persons is a critical step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff members with acute respiratory symptoms stay at home until the end of the fever, lack of elevated body temperature, and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever control or other symptoms-free medications, and prescribe flexibility in hospital leaves, allowing staff to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and ensuring staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed data or suspected COVID-19 infection, but there is a risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of the disease in society in the area where the business is located or due to the recent travel of such a person to the COVID-19 distribution sites.
These categories include workers who have had contact with the public, for example in schools, working environments with high population density and some major retail stores.The engineering tools for such groups and groups at higher risk include high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, physical barriers, such as transparent plastic shields, and the installation of windows for customer services without exiting the vehicle.The administrative measures for such a group and higher-risk groups include the recommendations of sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, the establishment of replacement schedules, the cessation of non-critical travel to COVID-19 distribution sites, the development of communication plans in emergency situations, including a forum for answering concerns to workers, the provision of relevant training for workers on the risks of COVID-19 and protection measures, the training of workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, the correct use of such devices, the provision of resources and a working environment conducive to personal hygiene, the requirement of regular handwashing, the restriction of access to the workplace by clients and the public, the provision of information bulletins on the need to use of protective clothing and equipment, the use of protective clothing, and other protective measures against the personal effects of COVI workers, and other risks may require the use of protection against the use of clothing.
In rare cases, workers at risk may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick on a plane, measures such as isolation of a sick person from others for a distance of 6 feet, appointment of a crew member to care for a sick person, provision of a sick person mask, or request to such person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing.
Secondary crew members should wear one-time medical gloves when approaching a sick traveller or when in contact with physiological liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protection if the patient has a fever, regular cough or breathing difficulties.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected; in cases involving commercial shipping, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, safety measures include delaying travel in the event of illness, self-insulating and informing the medical centre on board without delay if there is heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should be conducted in an isolated quarters of such a person, and in the case of schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or average prevalence of infection in the community, social distance strategies can be introduced, such as cancellation of visits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events such as exercise or choir singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, regulating arrival and care times, limiting minor visits, and using separate health facilities for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, measures for long-term non-visiting of the school may be considered: for law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to CDC.
Law enforcement officers obliged to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are encouraged to follow the same instructions as those given to ambulance nurses, including the use of suitable personal protective devices.
When close contact occurs during detention, employees must clean and decontaminate their uniforms and equipment before re-use with household cleaning aerosols or by washing, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and the disposal of used personal protective equipment, and use and laundry of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health-care workers and mortuaries are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who contact patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of contamination in the conduct of procedures accompanied by aerosol formation or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures accompanied by aerosol formation include sounding, cough-coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys or invasive sampling.
High-risk mortuary workers include staff who treat the bodies of people with confirmed illness or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if they perform an autopsy, they become very high-risk; additional engineering safety equipment for such risk groups includes the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed illness or suspicion of COVID-19, including in procedures involving aerosol formation.
In some health facilities and morgues, the use of negative-pressure ventilation may be an effective measure.
Samples should be handled with the precautions required for biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be distributed to segregated waiting areas depending on the existence of suspected COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protective devices, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers who interact up to 6 feet away with patients with confirmed illness or suspected infection of SARS-CoV-2, as well as for those who perform procedures accompanied by aerosol formation.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved respirators for a person with a N95 filter or a higher class need to be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection programme that specifies individual selection and medical examination requirements.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and comfort to the staff member. WHO does not recommend the use of clothing because COVID-19 is a disease transmitted by respiratory rather than through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends the use of surgical masks only for personnel performing screening at the receiving point.
For individuals collecting respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19 or vectors of the disease without procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, protective glasses or a shield for the face, robe and gloves.
In procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, a respirator N95 or FFP2 should be worn instead of a surgical mask.
Given the insufficient availability of personal protective equipment worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protections through the use of remote medicine, physical barriers such as such transparent windows, access to a patient infected with COVID-19 only by those who provide immediate care, the use of personal protective equipment only necessary for a specific task, the prolonged use of the same respirator without removing, when dealing with multiple patients with the same diagnosis, the monitoring and coordination of the personal protection supply chain, and the recommendation not to use masks for persons without symptoms.

THEMA: [Coved-19] Load relief and preparation for the future
DATE/TENTATIVE: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
AUTHORIZATIONS: CC0: No protected rights
This month, we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interaction of people around the world and our responsibilities to one another.
We have had no precedent for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the ability to sympathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen friendly and caring relationships among all our colleagues, reflected in e-mails, calls and chats — a remarkable confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, amazing people are working with us.
I speak of you as colleagues with great gratitude and pride.
Last week, I was informed of our appreciation for our work.
I was reminded how important it is for the world to have the opportunity to turn to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And that's possible because of your work, whether to make websites work, pay our colleagues, or protect community security.
The world needs the information provided in Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever before.
At a time like this, not only what we do but how we do it is important to achieve meaningful results for the world.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the way we work together, starting with the coming week.
Adjustments to our working order and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the c-team team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In our interaction, we have considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to ease the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to back off, then so be it.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff personnel:
We expect it to take about four hours a day or 20 hours a week until further orders are issued.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is permitted for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs are, whether to care for your family, to buy food or to go to a doctor, your well-being is our number one priority.
We don't keep track of your working time.
If you're sick, you don't have to work.
This is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.
There is no need for sick leave or compensatory time off: simply inform your supervisor and help the team to review the calendar and schedule to ensure coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, inform Brian of T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation).
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and reaffirmed our intention to honour obligations to our contractors and staff at hourly rates.
Each person will be paid according to the normal hourly rates applicable under normal circumstances.
This, in particular, implies periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can produce amazing results, especially in times like these.
Again, we're talking about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some jobs are considered to be significant.
We must always support such activities.
Teams SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety, and Fundraising (others) perform critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and shift the focus to support, which is critical to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we are simply focusing on the most important projects.
Slowing down today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We are not planning to work “two more to catch up” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work overtime to meet the unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new targets and timetables, if possible.
What's going on with the APP (annual plans)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the time frame for the implementation of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to propose an extension for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting to allow staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for loved ones, with a reduced schedule for all those who need or want to work for the next few weeks.
This extension significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, informing representatives and teams about the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this job.
Office condition, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco colleagues could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to decontaminate all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used antivirus solutions from the medical class to decontaminate all surfaces, as well as the reception halls and elevator halls through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules of caution, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared by the time we decide to come back.
Our office in D.C. (DC) is on the Web of WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 rules with us and all staff in DC.
Last week, our office in D.C. has completely moved to remote work in accordance with instructions from San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we were also discussing the rental of premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues, who work remotely, are aware of the possibility of correcting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider dividing them into a course of several days.
Set out clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send out information in advance.
By default, use video communication to facilitate interaction and communication, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For ease of reference, appoint a focal point, a person who will monitor the receipt of questions in chat and control the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for keeping notes (or joint briefing).
If necessary, contact the help desk by e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when buying snacks.
Connect to #remoties at Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying ergonomic manuals available in webinars to facilitate the efficiency of distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel mass events funded by Wikimedia, such as "editathons", until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of undertaking agreed grant activities, and no one will be fined for having to delay or change such objectives.
In the coming week, we will carry out follow-up activities with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
The general sentiment in the global community is not only frustration at the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief at the mutual understanding and the opportunity to focus on our own communities, Wikimedia and more.
In terms of perspective, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page that will provide space for the community to monitor impact and communication.
We're staying in touch on matters related to COVID-19.
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 2:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we will take the opportunity to further share relevant information, answer your questions and spend time together, joining each other.
We're in this situation together and we're ready to help as much as we can.
In doing so, you can continue to receive information from such e-mails, and other important information from the COVID-19 office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have been greatly affected by the current situation.
If there are questions about travel, events, key workflow, coverage problems or other assistance, contact CRT.
We stand ready to provide support and liaison as necessary.
If there are confidentiality issues, contact Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations via e-mail.
No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and our commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and enable us to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
The time has come to support each other and to create space for important work to be undertaken in future weeks and, perhaps, months.
For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work to the maximum extent possible as soon as the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and the rest of the team Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-reverse enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counters the activity of the appropriate angiotensin-reverting enzyme (ACE), reducing angiotensin II content and increasing Ang (1–7) making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-reverse enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal fermentation located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-conceal peptidaze domain M2 and the C-conceal transport domain of the renal amino acid collectrine.
ACE2 is a type I unipassing membrane protein, and its fermentatively active domain enters the surface of cells of lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracellular domain is removed from the trans-membrane domain by another enzyme known as scheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most type II alveolar lung cells, thin intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and cells of smooth muscles of the arteries of most organs.
ACE2 iRNA biosynthesis is also found in the cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE splits the angiotensin I hormone into the vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, scrubs the carboxil end amino acid phenyllanin from angiotenzene II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the vasodilateant angiotenin (1–7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also tear apart a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] - bradikinin, apelin, neurotenzine, dinorphine A and gelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transporter of neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is present at Hartnupa disease.
As a trans-membrane protein, ACE2 serves as the primary entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (a SARS-CoV-2 virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (a COVID-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, the binding of the S1 Spic-CoV protein and SARS-CoV2 to the fermentative ACE2 domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosoms located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the priming of S-protein protein with a TMPRSSS2 carrier protein, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic medium, which has led some to think that decreasing ACE2 levels in cells can help combat the infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend the continuation of standard APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic survey and metaanalysis published on 11 July 2012, "the use of APF inhibitors was associated with a significant 34 per cent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared with the control group".
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors, who were exposed to higher risk of pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than in patients with a general risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is believed to be an innovation in the treatment of acute lung injuries and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipolisacharides.
The half-life rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the action begins 30 minutes, in addition to 24 hours of exposure.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with intolerance of classical Renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases that increase circulating angiotensine II. The introduced rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory distress syndrome treatment.
COVID-19 applications are mobile phone software applications designed to assist in epidemiological investigation in the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, numerous annexes have been developed or proposed, officially supported by the authorities.
Several versions of contact tracking applications have been developed.
This gave rise to a discussion on confidentiality issues, especially with regard to those systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of application users.
The lighter options in this respect include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate Bluetooth-based support functions for such applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, together with Alipay, launched an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore uses an app called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be placed under the control of the government. Northern Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!" app working on Bluetooth, which helps track contacts with potentially infected people and provides operational communication with health authorities.
The annex was developed jointly by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting registration on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking app was in the final stages of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks; similar applications were planned to be launched in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering the use of applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether application and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use a geozonation application to ensure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who live in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a security professor at the University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with application-based systems, including false response and potential inefficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In view of concerns about the proliferation of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that could offer their coronavirus applications in the App Store to include only "official" or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon also introduced similar restrictions.
Members of the confidentiality campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus applications; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the surveillance infrastructure established to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the restriction of this type of oversight.
The organizations have declared eight conditions for public projects:
Surveillance must be “lawful, necessary and proportionate”;
Increased monitoring and observation should be accompanied by time-limit clauses;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19 control purposes;
The security and anonymity of the data should be protected and evidence of such protection should be provided;
Digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined by legislation;
Protection from abuse should be guaranteed, as should the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Owne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple offer their joint plan to address the ongoing surveillance problem, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as it is no longer necessary.
In some countries, web-based location tracking is used instead of applications, thus eliminating the need to download the application and avoiding tracing.
In Israel, network tracing was approved.
Network solutions that have access to source location data also have large potential privacy problems.
However, not all central server systems should have access to personal location data; a number of confidential systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication purposes (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that does not use applications as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking of mobile devices and transactions with maps, and then combined them to create notices in the form of text messages sent to potentially infected persons.
Not only did the Government use this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with infected persons, but it also made the location information publicly available, which was made possible by the significant changes in the legislation on the protection of information that had been made following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
Such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites, and countries, including Germany, are considering the use of both centralized and confidential systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details had not yet been made public.
Contact tracing, which preserves confidentiality, is a well-established concept, with a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013; as of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups have been working on solutions to ensure confidentiality, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the user's approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol.The decentralized protocols include decentralized confidential tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT), and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all comparisons occur on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that preserves confidentiality in the collection and use of location data or track intersections to track COVID-19 distribution.
The work of this platform is based on studies published in "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technology to allow users to share confidential location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of the data.
On April 5, 2020, a global TCN coalition was founded by groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of tracking and warning applications, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative that they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that preserves confidentiality.
They also published the technical specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Deployment of tools to enable Governments to create formal applications to track the movement of coronavirus-infected citizens, while maintaining data confidentiality
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve constant surveillance problems by first implementing the system through operating system upgrades and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.
Repository of a drug (also known as reprofiling, redirecting, changing tasks or therapeutic rerouting of drugs) is the reprofiling of an approved drug for the purpose of treating a disease or a medical condition other than that originally intended for development.
This is one of the areas of research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 and a transfusion of reconvalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 proteins that can be affected by drugs, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding areas provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective anti-virus drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like proteinase, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADF-ribophosfatase.
Hussein AA and the co-authors in their pre-clinical study examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analysed their similarities in structure with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which would be recommended for clinical research.
Chlorochine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the clinical test Solidarity.
New York Governor Andrew Kuomo announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine tests would begin in New York State on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquin sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Authorization for Use (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is only permitted under the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency treatment for patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under clinical testing schemes.
CDC stated that "the procedure of use, dosage or length of intake of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
The doctors say they use the drug when "there's no other way out."
The Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University School of Medicine at Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that the favipirvir is "uniquitably effective".
For 35 patients in Shenzhen who took the drug, the negative result was on average 4 days later, while 45 patients who did not took the drug had a duration of 11 days.
A study was carried out in Wuhan, in which 240 patients with pneumonia were observed, one half receiving a favipirvir and the other half receiving a umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical department reminded the public that the results indicating the efficacy of the drug were scant and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug in Japan to supplement its stock, and that military resources would be used to deliver it to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe informed the Trump administration about the possibility of purchasing a drug. The drug may be less effective in neglected cases of disease.
It may not be safe for pregnant patients or for patients who try to get pregnant.
One study on the combination of antiviral drugs Lopinavir and Ritonavir (Caletra) concluded that "no effective use of the drugs has been identified".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to proteasis.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a connection that will connect to SARS-CoV-2 protein. The scientific community criticizes the reprofiling of drugs that were specifically designed for HIV and AIDS therapy.
WHO included a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.
Remdesiver was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences staff found that remdesiver has antiviral activity in vitro for multiple phylo-, pneumo-, paramixo- and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with anti-virus treatment is the development of resistance through mutations, which can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that remdesives may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are under way, including two conducted by Cleveland University Clinics; one on moderate patients and the other on patients with heavier forms.
Three clinical trials for vitamin C injection are under way for people who are hospitalized with a serious COVID-19 form: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, the antibiotic tests of asitromycin began in the state of New York City.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclosonic) Tajjin, an inhalation corticosteroid for asthma treatment, for use in the treatment of presymptom patients infected with new coronavirus.
Stage II, a form of angiotensin-retroducing enzyme 2, is tested with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of disease in order to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with weak COVID-19 symptoms.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over were invited to be diagnosed with COVID-19, with slight symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women who breastfeed and do not use effective contraception cannot participate in this study.
In Italy, several coagulants are being tested.
Low-colecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Drug Administration to publish recommendations for the use of the drug.
On 14 April, a 300-patient multi-centre study on the use of sodium enoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on reprofiling approved antivirus drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for treatment by COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been found to be potentially suitable for COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilysumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved in China.
Also trials in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a 2019 hypothetic vaccine against coronavirus (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has undergone clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be available earlier than 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were undergoing phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread throughout the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that in early 2020, 10 different technology platforms were under study and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in phase I safety studies are:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate drug: Moderna, IRNA-1273)
Viral vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate drug: CanSino Biologys, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 additional candidate vaccines have been reported but little publicly available (presumably in the planning or development phase).
In phases I to II, pre-tests are conducted for safety and immunology, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and on several sites with the simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III of the test typically covers more participants, including the control group; at this stage the drugs are tested for disease prevention effectiveness and at the same time the side effects are monitored at optimum doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates under active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet undergone human testing (still under pre-clinical investigation).
On January 24, 2020, Queensland University, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of Saskatchewan University, Canada, announced that work had begun on its own vaccine to start testing in people in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were also announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies led by Hanneke Shuitmaker announced that work had begun on developing their vaccine.
Janssen is working with his biotechnology partner Vaxart to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on developing a vaccine on technology similar to that used for vaccination against neoantigen cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced the completion of the vaccine synthesis and the commencement of trials.
On February 27, 2020, Generex's subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to develop an i-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
Their goal was to develop a candidate drug for a vaccine that could be tested in humans in 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.

On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a partnership with Novavac Inc.
for the development and production of a vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for pre-clinical testing and stage I clinical testing by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were examining 11 isolated patients, and that even in an accelerated manner it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, reported that with partial funding from the Canadian Institute for Health Research, they had created a particle similar to the coronavirus.
A potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory research and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "large sums of money" for exclusive access to Covid-19 vaccine, to which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNtech to jointly develop an IRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162 is an IRNA-based vaccine candidate; the drug is currently undergoing pre-clinical trials, and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, the Italian biotechnology company Takes Biotech announced that in April 2020 it would receive the results of preclinical trials, and their final vaccine candidate drug could start testing on people as early as the fall.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), France, announced that $4.9 million had been invested in the COVID-19 vaccine consortium, with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other investment partners of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novafax, universities in Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers of Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-ampling RNA vaccine from COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving a sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million to fund 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of multiple vaccine candidate drugs in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago initiatives and Saskatchewan University.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced a grant of 192 million Canadian dollars specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans to establish a national vaccine bank, which will include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported testing PittCoVac, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, stating that "MNA introduced subunit vaccines SARS-CoV-2 S1, causing strong responses to antigen-specific antibodies [to mice] that appeared two weeks after immunization".
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo University Canadian Pharmaceutical School announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine, which may be produced in the form of nasal spray.
With bacteriophags, DNA will reproduce within human bacteria and form harmless viral-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities combined IBM supercomputer resources with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages than those of disease prevention.
Another randomized study in Australia involves 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Early studies to assess the efficacy of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower apes, point to the need for measures to contain a biosecurity level 3 infection in the treatment of living viruses, as well as for international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines that are safe and effective for people to treat SARS.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world. There is also no tested vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to spread, it was thought that the study of SARS, which was conducted at the time, could become the standard for developing vaccines and therapeutics against the MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (based on DNA) MERS vaccine that passed stage I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines and were under development, two were adenovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one was MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
A conspiracy theory was spread on social media claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not new, and that a vaccine against it already existed.
Publications on social media quoted the words of some patients who claimed the existence of patents on the genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and respiratory difficulty.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
The majority of cases are related to mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease translates into viral pneumonia and polyorganic insufficiency.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people had been killed by the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered: the virus is mostly spread when people are in close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops released into the air by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these drops occur when exhaled, they usually pose a threat to the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air at long distances.
People are also infected by touching a contaminated surface and then by their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days after the symptoms appear, although its spread may be possible both before the symptoms appear and at later stages.The standard diagnostic method is a polymerasic chain reaction with inverse real-time transcription (RT-PRC) on a sample taken as a swab from the nostril.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients suspected of being ill and to those caring for them.
Recommendations on the use of medical masks vary from one department to another: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, and others require them.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
The local spread of the disease was recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or feeling of chest depression, confusion of consciousness, difficulties in awakening, face or lip blueness; if the above symptoms are present, immediate medical attention should be sought.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, blinking, or throat pain, may be less common.
Also, there are different percentages of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
Some cases recorded in China were initially shown only by chest compression and high heart rate.
In some cases, the disease can progress by developing into pneumonia, polyorganic insufficiency, and eventually death occurs.
It's called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people show symptoms within 11.5 days of infection and not all infected people are reported to show symptoms.
The role of such unsympathetic carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of infected people with an unsymptomic current of the disease is currently unknown and is only being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases and hospital cases about the virus were unsymptomous.
China ' s National Health Commission began to include unsymptomous cases in its daily report from 1 April; of the 166 cases recorded on that day, 130 (78%) were not symptomous at the time of testing.
Both wetness and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
There are more drops in the air when speaking loudly than when speaking normal loudness.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that when coughed open, drops can spread up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
The virus is generally not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioaerosol transmission of virus particles is still possible, and testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside human rooms has revealed the presence of a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (CPR), can lead to exhalation and hence spread the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus may spread through feces, but the risk is considered low; the virus is the most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before symptoms occur, but the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claims that it is not clear yet how easily the virus spreads, yet it is known that one patient usually infects 2 to 3 other people, and that the virus is able to survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface the virus was able to live for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces up to four hours.
These figures, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
soap and detergents, if properly used, have a rather useful effect in controlling infection: soap destroys the fat protection layer of the virus by deactivating it and can remove it from skin surfaces and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorogexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective against the virus; in a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient, the highest levels of the virus in the blood were detected on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome first discovered in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases recorded in Wuhan.
All signs of a new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in naturally related coronaviruses.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which reveals its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
Lightweights are the organ most exposed to COVID-19 because the virus penetrates host cells through angiotensin-reverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar cells.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell with characteristic surface glycoprotein, the "ship" (peplomer).
Twelve per cent of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan have been diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in a serious form of disease.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during the disease's progression, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities as they participate in the work of this body.
The high frequency of thrombosis (31 per cent) and venous thromboembolium (25 per cent) was observed in patients in ISA with COVID-19 and may indicate adverse predictions. The autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar injuries (DAD) and lymphocyto-containing inflammatory inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropicism towards ACE2-expressing epithelial airway cells, patients with a severe COVID-19 current show symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogen GM-CSF T cells were found to be correlated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that release IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
The autopsy also revealed lymphocytary infiltrates.
WHO has also published several testing protocols for the disease.
Real-time polymuscular chain reaction (RT-PRC) is a standard test method.
The test is usually conducted on respiratory samples taken from the nostril, but a swab from the nose or wetness may also be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken at two-week intervals and the results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerasic chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibodies tests that could detect the presence of an infection at the present time, as well as possible past infection, were under development but were not yet widely available.
The Chinese experience of examining the results of the tests has shown that their accuracy is only 60 to 70 per cent.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, allowing it to be used at the end of this month.
Two-way multi-bed subpleural compactions of the type of "mat glass" with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterior distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of a rock bridge (additional thickness of a partition with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
Main results of the pathological study performed at the autopsy:
Macrocopy: pleuric, pericarditis, compression and oedema of the lungs
Four types of gravity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Light pneumonia: lung edema, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinuclear giant cells
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory dysressis syndrome (DDS) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar layers and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Diffuse intravascular clotting (DVS syndrome); leukoeritroplastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, adherence to the rules of respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inner side of the elbow's arm area.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended that a quality hygiene procedure be carried out for the hands.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue masks in public places, in particular to limit transmission by people with an unsymptomic disease, and social distance strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; schools and businesses have been closed down, the movement of citizens has been restricted and major public events have been cancelled.
Recommendations for distance also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no proven effective drugs against COVID-19; since the development of the vaccine is not expected to be completed before 2021, most of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 are reduced by the peak of the epidemic known as the "outfall on the plateau".
CDC also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with heavy hand pollution, as well as before eating and after shrivelling, coughing or sneezing.
CDC also recommends the use of a decontamination alcohol-containing (at least 60% alcohol content) hand treatment, but only when soap and water are unavailable. To regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two recipes for local production.
These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not suitable for antiseptic treatment of hands.
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
CDC recommends that those suspected of being infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extracorporate membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being explored.
Personal hygiene, healthy lifestyles and diets are recommended to strengthen immunity.
Supporting therapy can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease; WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care doctors and pulmonologists compiled the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific COVID-19 treatment.
To treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health professionals recommend choosing paracetamol (acetamineofen) over ibuprofen.
Precautionary measures must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly in health facilities, in procedures that may cause aircapel emissions, such as intubation or hand drying.
The CDC recommends placing health care workers with COVID-19 in an AIIR facility, an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions. CDC published recommendations on the use of Personal Protection Devices (PPS) during the pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective bathrobe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves; it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks from the above-mentioned equipment.
The N95 respirators have been approved for industrial use, but the FDA has allowed the use of these respirators in accordance with the Emergency Authorization for Use (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used without instructions, the effectiveness of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective face screens or, as a last resort, the manufacture of masks on its own in the home.
In most cases, COVID-19 forms are not heavy enough to require artificial ventilation of the lungs or its alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory failure linked to COVID-19 is currently under active study, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a nose oxygen canny with high air flow or two-level positive pressure in the respiratory tract.
It is not yet known whether either of these two methods is as effective for patients in critical condition as the IVL.
Some doctors choose invasive mechanical lung ventilation if it is available because it significantly limits the distribution of particles in the air as compared to nose cans with intensive air flow; the risk of severe disease for older persons (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
Many developed countries lack hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the dramatic increase in severe COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalization.
According to a study conducted in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 percent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in intensive care.
The task of artificial lung ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory dysressis syndrome (ARDS), developed at COVID-19, and oxygenation is increasingly problematic.
The IWL, supported by inhalation pressure and PAC, is necessary to deliver maximum amount of oxygen in the lungs and to ensure minimum ventilation damage that may result in the development of pneumothorax.
In earlier fan models, high VACs may not be available.
Studies of potential treatments began in January 2020, and several anti-virus drugs are currently under clinical trial.
The remdesir is the most promising.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Anti-viral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers are involved in testing the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. FDA has granted temporary permission to use reconvalescence plasma as an experimental treatment when a person's life is in serious or imminent danger.
It has not been subjected to clinical research to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application designed to control the outbreak of the disease.
Users are required to enter their name and identification number for entry.
The application can detect “near contact” with observational data and thus determine the potential risk of contamination.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-inclusion, but also sends a notification to local health authorities, analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence — such tools are used to track infected people and persons they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to track the mobile phone data of people who were suspected to be infected with coronavirus.
Measures had been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who could contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, he provided German federal government agencies and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to detect quarantine violators.
Italian Regional Commissioner for Health Giulio Gallera told that cell network operators report that "40% of people still continue to move across the territory."
The Government of Germany conducted a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulide also called for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may be under stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor's words: "Enhanced social exclusion, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic decline are ideal conditions for harming the mental health and well-being of people".
The disease may occur in light form with minor or missing symptoms that resemble other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Patients with a mild form of illness usually recover for two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may take between three and six weeks to treat.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although similar data on COVID-19 are not available. In some people COVID-19 may hit lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In persons with the most severe course of illness, COVID-19 can rapidly progress into acute respiratory dystress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or polyorganic insufficiency.
COVID-19 complications include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, and heart, kidney and liver problems.
The abnormality of thrombosis, especially the increase in protrombine time, was described in 6% of patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, while the kidney function is impaired in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 have liver enzymes (transaminasis) increased.
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to the ICU was seven days.
According to early-stage studies, the average time from the onset of initial symptoms to the day of death was 14 days with a full range of 6 to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
Hystopathological studies of postmortem lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cell fibromixoid exsudates in both lungs.
Pneumocytes showed viral cytopatic changes.
The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory dystrophe syndrome (HRD).
In 11.8 per cent of deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were associated with an increase in troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and the availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality vary according to the state due to such regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.
Lack of effective counting of cases in a light form may result in an overestimation of mortality.
Nevertheless, the fact that death occurs as a result of past diseases may mean that the current mortality rate is undervalued.
The severe symptoms of COVID-19 were generally 1.4 times more common among smokers, and these patients were about 2.4 times more likely to be in need of intensive care or to die than non-smokers, and concerns were expressed about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of a clinic in Hong Kong found that some patients who recovered from the disease had their lungs reduced by 20 to 30 per cent and their scan revealed damage.
After recovery, this can also lead to After Intensive Therapy syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether patients recovering from the virus had sustained immunity against it.
Based on the current of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but also reported cases where, after recovery from COVID-19, coronavirus tests were still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been an increased long-term disease rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, of animal origin and to be an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases confirmed by COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, describes 1 December 2019 as the earliest date of the first case of disease.
According to official figures published by WHO, the date was 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary according to region and time, and are also affected by the levels of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment systems used, the time since the onset of the disease and population parameters such as age, gender and general health status.
In late 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency codes: U07.1 to deaths from laboratoryly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9 per cent (153,822/2 240 191).
This figure varies from one region to another: some other methods include the determination of the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of patients diagnosed who have died as a result of the disease, as well as the determination of the disease-related mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died as a result of the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect a certain segment of the population from infection until the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced by all patients who have suffered the infection, the presence of such antibodies makes it possible to understand how many people have been infected.
At the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castillona d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the carnival celebration among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been overburdened.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, according to donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.04% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates vary between men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.
The group most at risk is men over the age of 50; the gap between men and women is narrowing only from the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The precise reasons for this discrepancy are unknown, but may be genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, and associated diseases in men (e.g. hypertension in men at a younger age than in women) may lead to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of those infected were men, and 72 per cent of COVID-19 deaths were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not keep gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ODS have different gender statistics.
The majority of health workers, especially nurses, are women and are therefore more likely to be infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanham Gebreisus, explains: "CO" means "corona", "VI" means "virus", "D" means "disease" (disease), and 19 is the year when the outbreak was first detected: December 31, 2019.
Such a name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international naming recommendations aimed at preventing stigma.
WHO adds the terms "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public messages.
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "Hanka coronavirus".
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in disease and virus names, WHO recommended the use of the terms “an acute respiratory disease of 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names of the virus and disease.
The official names "COVID-19" and "SARS-CoV-2" were published on February 11, 2020.
Due to limitations in the volume of standard supply chains, some digital service providers print medical materials such as nose swabs as well as parts of IWL vehicles.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a vent valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time, at which time a local facility was reprofiled and was able to print the required 100 valves overnight.
After the outbreak of COVID-19 for the first time, various conspiracy theories, misinformation, and fake information about the origin of the virus, its magnitude, prevention, treatment and other aspects began to spread on the Internet at a high rate.
Humans may be infected with the virus of other animals.
Research results have not confirmed the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is currently no approved vaccine for the virus or drugs for its treatment.
Various international studies on vaccines and medicines from COVID-19 are currently being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SoLIDARITY Trial programme, which aims to assess the treatment effects of the four existing compounds considered most effective to date.
There is no ready vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidate drugs.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so scientific research uses the results of previous SarS-CoV studies.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers seek to create a whole-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to induce a rapid human immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, is to create a vaccine that increases the immune system ' s sensitivity to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research is aimed at destroying the S-swipe protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new vaccine development method).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
Vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antitelesamic augmentation has been identified as one of the potential problems in developing vaccines for SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are under way.
The drugs approved for malaria treatment were evaluated in seven tests, four of which were hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The reprofiling of anti-virus drugs is the majority of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine phase III remdesive studies had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for COVID-19 had been carried out. To the same end, several other existing antiviral drugs for COVID-19 treatment, including remdesive, chloroquine and hydroxichloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir, and lopinavir / ritonavir, combined with beta interferon, are also being considered.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the effectiveness of the use of the remdesiver.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesives on an exceptional basis.
Phase III of the clinical trials is already under way in the United States, China and Italy, and the use of chloroquine previously used for malaria treatment was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
Nevertheless, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virusology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use permit for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19.The Chinese instructions of the 7th edition also listed interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanid was recommended for detailed study in vivo, showing the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that the application of trans-membrane serin 2 (TMCRSS2) protein is necessary to penetrate SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without asythromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study; Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in COVID-19 treatment is unclear.
Hypercitokinemia may occur as a complication in the late stages of the heavy form COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinemia properties, and as a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilysumabe has been included in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.
The drug has reached stage 2 of an unrunomized test, which is conducted nationally in Italy, after the positive results of its use in patients with a severe disease have been obtained.
Combined with blood serum analysis on ferritin to detect cytokinic storms, it is designed to counter factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA was approved by an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies to treat the steroid refractory cytokin release syndrome caused by another cause, T cell therapy CAR.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilismub is an effective means of treating cytokin release syndrome.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients recovering from COVID-19 to people in need is now seen as a non-vaccinatory method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of patients from SARS, but the results have been inconclusive.
Neutralization of the virus is the expected effect that passive antibodies therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as anti-thelo-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be used.
Other forms of passive antibodies therapy, e.g. using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against the virus, may be increased.
