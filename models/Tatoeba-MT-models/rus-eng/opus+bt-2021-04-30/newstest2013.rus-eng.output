Republican Strategy for Resistance to Obama's Re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat fraud in elections.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter myth, arguing that cases of falsifying elections in the United States are more rare than those resulting from lightning strikes.
Moreover, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have since 2009 enacted laws that make registration or voting more difficult.
This phenomenon took on new dimensions after the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states were passed in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require the voter to present a photo ID and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register voters on the day of expression of will, and withdraw the right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present an identity card with a photograph.
Indiana was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities have hastened to extend this practice to other states as well.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to present photo identification cards in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached voting age, do not have an identity card with a photograph issued by their state government.
In addition, five million new voters did not have such a document in 2012.
However, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect youth, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo identity card.
But that's not all.
Electoral students who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use a photo ID issued by their educational establishment in several states.
At the same time, the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mostly for Republicans, to use the licences issued by these clubs for voting.
Until 2004, no state required proof of American citizenship to vote.
This was the first time such a claim had been introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are apparently aimed at limiting the vote of Latin Americans.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators initiated laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
They also limited the right of individuals or groups to assist those wishing to register.
This restriction has not passed without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to register about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17 per cent drop in the new voter registration rate in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted early were African Americans, although the latter constituted only 13 per cent of the total number of voters in the state.
The same was true of Latin American nationals.
Representing only 11 per cent of the electorate, they accounted for 24 per cent of citizens who voted early.
Unlike whites, who make up 76% of the electorate, only 46% of the electorate voted early.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws were vetted by Democratic governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This has resulted in a partial limitation of the negative effects.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the production of a photo identity card.
Nevertheless, the new rules that have come into force will undoubtedly impede the exercise of the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Democrat critics condemn the bias of laws that have been passed, seeing them as clearly oriented towards influencing the 2012 election results in key states.
The Brennan Center ' s 2011 report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral board to win the presidential election.
It is too early to state with confidence that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: do you want to take a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test produces sometimes erroneous results, false and sometimes falsely positive, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctant to undergo a dispensation, have much more to doubt.
Do you want to pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
Research conducted in the United States has found numerous cases of infection among groups of researchers, so the data are difficult to interpret and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different mortality rates for those patients who have undergone screening and those who have not.
The study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that metastasis was 30-40% higher for those who did not pass screening.
So I would recommend a test from age 50, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer is discovered.
Cancer can be both aggressive and volatile.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer by offering him possible options, without compulsory prostate cancer treatment, which does not pose a risk to life in the long run, and by making a choice, in these cases, to actively monitor the disease.
To date, many men diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
We'll offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts to progress, we'll start treatment.
Increasingly, we define with precision the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
So I'd recommend taking a test.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to take this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool that allows us to evaluate everything for and against passing the PSA test.

Prevent Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle receptor to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in scientific research, healthy lifestyles remain the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people were well fed and moved enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If no one else had smoked, this number would have risen to at least 50%," stresses André Bolé, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cases of cancer are due to inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking control remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85 per cent of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous damage to human health.
"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says spokesman André Bolé.
The encouraging fact is that 10 years after smoking is abandoned, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon, colon, esophagus, pancreatic, and uterine cancer.
"Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," added to the Association.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too many quantities, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
sausages should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salin may result in carcinogenic substances.
"The latter may harm the cells of the body and lead to cancer," the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been investigating the impact of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But the results of these studies are not clear at this time.
According to SCC, vitamin E studies produce contradictory results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other had the opposite effect.
The impact of vitamin D cancer is also unclear.
However, he stressed that it was important to discuss his concerns and family history with the doctor.
"Analysis doesn't lead to cancer".
Higgs' boson in detail
The previous summer, it was reported that scientists might have been able to locate the Higgs boson that caused a real agitation - and not without cause.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, it is the last particle predicted in the Standard Model - our best, or in any case, the “best imperfect” description of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not previously been able to be detected in an experimental way.
But physics isn't quite sure it's the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we're dealing with a really new particle and that it's very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical convention in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data are not yet available for full confidence.
Let's imagine it's about the Higgs boson, because the odds of being wrong seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law absolutely inevitable, saying that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way around this rule, don't even try too hard, or you'll hurt yourself.
But although particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of this nature: the principle of Paulie's exclusion, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same point in time if they are in the same "quantum state" is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
On this basis, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find decent citizens called ferries who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
Another is bosons, a vile gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything — at least this principle, which means that they may find themselves in the same place at the same time.
According to the website (by the way, a completely extraordinary) Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboratories, these bosons are in turn divided into two groups: the mesons we are not going to talk about here, and the "particles of force" by which the main forces of nature are spread and to which the Higgs boson in some way refers.
These very bosons, it should be stressed, are not all exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's because of one incredibly banal boson: a photon, or "part of light", which is an electromagnetic messenger.
Indeed, when one particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" an electromagnetic field in this particular location, roughly like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "violation" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons of the "power carrier".
More stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, with the only difference that for this boson to appear, there must be a "violation" of another field, the Higgs field.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very and very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond whose surface could only shake a very large stone.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator, like the one operating in CERN, the Big Adron Collider, which is a 27 km diameter ring!, to achieve such huge energies.
An electromagnetic field analogy is also useful to explain the relationship between Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with an electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never hold onto the refrigerator itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who interact have mass, while others (as photon, by the way) do not.
So, what's "can bring" all this research, is Ms. Plamondon asking?
In science, they are used to test the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to find a discrepancy between observations and predictions of the CM.
In addition, some of them are eager to see such a discrepancy revealed, so the slightest inconsistency can open the door to "new physics" and shut up some of the Model's holes.
The latter, to be said, still has significant shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oy!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oy!).
But we haven't found any such differences in CERN yet.
Impact
The benefits of these studies for the daily life of the average person are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it does not exist.
See, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in Bell's labs couldn't even guess what revolution their work would be.
They anticipated their applications in science, but no more than that.
Indeed, the already deceased physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell's Laboratories, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself designed the first continuous laser (previously impulse) in 1962, said that the laser was originally viewed as more of a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
In addition, an application could be found for the tools accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle, during his optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although not its original purpose at all, now serves as an eye for all digital cameras in the world and has won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die...
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
Debates are due to resume soon, and a bill is being prepared at this time.
Nevertheless, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
Debt tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Monteregi.
The prostate cancer that destroyed him from the inside gave him a two-year reprieve.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at Victor Gadbua's palliative care shelter in Beloye, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet and even eating on your own.
Sitting at a table with a delicious meal, he surrenders and agrees to be helped to eat.
He wakes up, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bath.
Courage before ordinary death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this disease.
"We are taught throughout our lives that a man must pee standing," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbois Home.
Regressing to the condition of a child is an intolerable humiliation for some.
"Everything depends on a man's ability" to accept decline, he claims.
Since many people who are engaged in palliative care, important events occur in the midst of this decline.
Patients who go to Victor Gadbois palliative shelter are all suffering from cancer.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of their lives.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses no longer provides what is called "medical."
Ms. A., 89, is the most afraid of dying "in the mind of suffocation."
But the disease let me know my kids.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in my life," she says, before I let her put on a mask that eases her breath.
She is still waiting for her son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
The Victor Gadbois shelter provides body care and nutritional assistance with the help of a group of volunteers.
This is the palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
Quebec has one place in palliative care facilities for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That's not enough, considering sooner or later we're all gonna die.
Life here continues in the best possible conditions, as explained by Dr. Christian Martel, one of the shelter's doctors.
Whether it's physical, emotional, or emotional.
To a dying man, we'll agree to provide mouthwash out of brandy or Pepsi, if he asks.
Diabetics are no longer controlled by sugar.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we brought beer to Mr. H., who died last night.
In the morning, his son drank that beer in the feet of the deceased.
"We help loved ones as well as patients," said Natalie Savar, director of nursing.
At Victor Gadbois shelter, not a single day is like the previous day.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, placed on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a 36-year-old youth dies tragically, surrounded by parents, a wife and two small children, and tried everything to survive.
"In the last six months between three and five beds, always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christian Martel anxiously.
53 per cent of patients admitted to Victor Gadbois Home come from home, and 47 per cent from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients in the final phase of their lives, whether at home, in hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbois Home and the Palliative Home Care Society of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is this large gap in Quebec's health care system that causes many PMTs to fear the adoption of a law legalizing euthanasia and helping to commit suicide.
Beginning in October, a manifesto signed by the lighthouses in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant, indicating their opposition to such an initiative, is circulating.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to palliative care of high quality before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the E.R., in terrible pains, and no one took the necessary measures to ease them.
I'm afraid patients only want to die because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day try to save patients despite pessimistic predictions.
Hopes for the survival of Helen Richard were already minimal when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was ending the treatment, she told me that she regretted that I was ending the struggle, she said.
But she told me that my days were numbered!
There is no all-powerful care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for failing to comply with their request, after the palliative care team eases their pain.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in fighting pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Palliative Home Care Society of Greater Montreal, patients are not susceptible to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time or permanently.
You can't pretend we don't know about this suffering anymore.
More and more patients who fail to relieve pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain always say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean, "I want to be euthanasiaded," it means, "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Health Research Institute of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road construction officials, construction contractors, political party fund-raisers and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about the huge “system” surrounding the construction industry, public servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafias.
The industry, which cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious how this system breaks down after all the means have been put into action, joked by Jacques Ducheno, MP and former chief of the Montreal Police".
It was through him that a scandal broke out in 2011 as a by-product of the investigation of official offences related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister of the time from the Liberals, Jean Share, agreed very reluctantly.
The Ducheno Report established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and corruption.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes, the Department of Transportation alone would have kept a billion dollars on contracts," if some had restrained their instincts to take a share.
The Charbonno Commission "has already removed two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will be able to "discover schemes behind individuals."
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011
The 2011 Standing Anti-Corruption Unit, which included a large number of government auditors, investigators and analysts, was involved.
In addition, the staff of the special unit Molot, who forced Montreal's “stove cartel” after 2009, to stop overvaluing contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
It is next to Gille Vayancourt, who recently resigned as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having received bribes repeatedly when placing public orders.
In addition, several Montreal route engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Aquuro and Lino Zambito, were formally charged.
The latter detonated a real bomb, reporting an investigation into the "system" of receiving government contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3 per cent of the value of contracts concluded in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia, who in turn transferred money from the party of Mayor Gerald Tramble, United Montreal.
In the 2000s, Zambito wasted money to the right and to the left, and he contributed over 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mostly the liberals then in power.
In addition, he admitted to illegally collecting funds for former Liberal Party Deputy Prime Minister Natalie Normando.
Sewage contracts overvalued
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked without fail.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes totalling $736,000 in exchange for sewage contracts, the value of which he overestimated.
Other officials responsible for road construction admitted that they received 30 to 40 per cent of the bills on the paw with false additions.
One organizer from the mayor's party, Martan Dumont, then accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party's banks with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Trumple resigned in early November, plunged Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal to stir up anxiety.
The mayor of Rivier de Prairie County in the east of the island, she has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal plot bought for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of the dirty money in campaigning
She says that in the investigation that will eventually begin, she "will pull a thread to understand the functioning of an ant-infested system to stop the gangren and identify the perpetrators."
This process is characterized as a "suffering but positive one".
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of dubious practices.
How we clean up at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Ducheno notes for his part that "the officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "the elected officials who knew about the scheme" but who did not participate in the schemes.
Given that the share of dirty money in electoral financing in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes, "I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations to parties to $100, but he says it won't change the situation: "Until we strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
It requires a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and party financing: “We cannot fall below; by boldly grasping the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If that story casts a shadow over the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duscheno calls on those who laugh to look into their own court ...
"SGW is not Barcelona FC!"
This season, you've reached an extraordinary scale in the SSP.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual consciousness, but also by the new dimension of the SWD.
The great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
Technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football, it's happening very quickly.
But I don't break up.
From the beginning, at the NIF Pre-Training Center in Clarefontaine and before I arrived in Saint-Etienne, I always stepped forward.
So you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Angelotti...
Replenishment of this summer is not new to play very high-level matches.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to a player like me wanting to be on the level and to be up to his maximum.
In addition, Carlo Angelotti supports my positioning.
He is assisted by deputies such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I did.
Is Angelotti the host of the position?
Sure.
Angelotti inspires respect for all the technical staff.
Today, he is not equal in the First League and is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and has won many titles with high-end clubs.
He worked with the great players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
That's when I left a whole series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the SWS season?
In the First League, Lyon took our lead.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we were spectacularly qualified in one eighth of the finals.
What's the club's goal in this tournament?
We'll try to get as far away as we can.
From now on, everything can be.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, to be able to take a return match in one eighth of the finals.
Can the SSP become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate long-term positions.
That's not true today.
The SWD has the financial means to make this project real.
Not taking the title in the First League, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this championship.
We were close last season.
In May, there was disappointment because we had everything we needed to get to the finish first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
Generally, 79 points suggest the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Although strong teams such as Marcel, Lyon, and Bordeaux have joined in the title fight, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media expect too much from the SPF?
It's normal that we're expected to do a lot, given how much money we've invested and what kind of players we have.
We're totally ready for this.
On the other hand, when we're home winning 4-0 against Troy and we're still found to be criticized for, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what people expect of us first.
We can never win every weekend with a 4-0 score.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement the game's project.
The team is formed over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who hasn't made it to one eighth of the finals in two seasons, though they've also spent huge sums of money!
Based on the contributions, we've seen you 15 points ahead of us by the winter break.
That would be a disregard for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lyon and Marcel, who weren't up last season, were woken up by this new SSP.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won as a result.
The SWS seems to be entirely dependent on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimović.
So what if they say there's some kind of "Zlatano Dependence"?
This merely means that Ibrahimović is very successful and that he scores many goals.
He came for it and he proves he's a First League star.
Wherever he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world-wide star.
In the group, we respect him as a man and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was really exclusive.
It encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive the Euro 2012 with France?
How disappointing.
I was eager to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from taking a little game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
Today I'm able to play good qualifying matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized from the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and we must now behave exemplaryly.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Desham, headed by the Blues?
They're good for him.
He has good positions in the qualifying team for the World Cup.
He's a strict coach, he's close to the players and inspiring to win.
What Laurent Blanc was like.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us in the Euro.
I hope Didier Desham brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved draw (1-1) torn out on 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, there were no matches like this in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties with commissions to process them.
Moreover, as is often the case with these technologies, there is a clear political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudony), is simultaneously a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euro ...) and a protected BitTorrent-type exchange protocol that allows file exchanges between participants of the same level.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers online.
Several thousand sites take bitcoins to make donations or as a payment medium.
The rate of Bitcoin, reaching a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later before returning today to about ten dollars (the rates are listed on Bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the world's exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB), in its virtual currency report published in October, became interested in the system.
He describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with a dollar or euro" and "like ordinary currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as "credits" used to promote in video games that are earned in the game process or that can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The Facebook social network has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations always control and process a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all network nodes are both book holders, auditors, issuers of currency, buyers and sellers.
How does the network function?
Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed, using a double key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that bitcoins used in the deal do exist in a public ledger distributed throughout the network.
A key step is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
It goes through the solution of a mathematical task sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, receives the privilege of adding this new line.
This is the hash phase of the file, that is, converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hashing" all together.
The aim is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (multiple zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes easily verify that it is correct.
The transaction thus turns out to be unrarely linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user would want to pay twice the same money in less than ten minutes, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoin.
To avoid inflation, the award is regularly divided in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred million, leaving a further reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing capacity.
The network has already experienced ups and downs.
Sites providing Bitcoin services were attacked, and bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
"The defect used does not concern the protocol itself," assured Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paymium, a company that pays with real money using Bitcoin.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this shortcoming.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog, are allowed to do so.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of account and discovered that almost 80 percent of the Bitcoin were not in circulation.
Giant sales were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," cheers Jon Holmquist, who works at Coinabul, who converts bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, the other author of this currency manual, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or a non-contact payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is thus cheaper.
The owner better controls his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is simple in marketing for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough to give an address that can be "photographically and recognizable" by a phone, as Pierre Nuaz explains, making sure that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin is confirmed, it will take some time, but 2013 may be a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB expects, by the way, to reconsider the various risks that are now considered to be heightened if the system succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapis and Surobi).
NATO and Americans should follow them in late 2014.
The time has come for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future without just hoping for us.
We suffered mainly from Afghan peasants, whom we viewed as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 dead soldiers and wounded and injured.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case under the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks join them.
They are tolerated, sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will no longer be as soon as the West becomes more sensitive.
The departure of French troops from Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills planted by almond trees thanks to French credit, was proceeding well.
The convoy of trucks and armoured vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
There will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul since the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in flames and blood due to fighting between different factions.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for the darkening of these peasants, which has surpassed Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into dealers seizing state land to resell them for development to returnees returning from Iran and Pakistan, using huge United States subcontracts.
They're discredited; most of them didn't even fight themselves, by the way.
People, I hear in the countryside, want a government that isn't made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave as those who have succeeded in American generosity leave: capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
State schools in urban areas are filled with both boys and girls.
There is a need to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return to the darkening of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and that watch everywhere.
There's an army at the moment.
The authorities that would command her, would they be considered legitimate?
The old commanders who fought the anti-Soviet struggle are already taking steps to restore provincial friends who would not be subordinated to the central authorities.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local differences, should be somewhat decentralized, following the pattern of Western countries, but the United States wanted to make it a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the April 2014 elections.
But his country, starting in the 1950s, and even before, depended on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, and no irrigation system has been repaired.
All are imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ravaged by thirty years of war, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has enormous mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the feeling that Western countries were there to take over.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without means of transport to export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Ainak copper field, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the province's largest employers.
It is also necessary that one day, in an equal manner, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are heavily dependent, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a lycée for girls, for boys, a French language faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to win hearts and minds and fulfil the impossible task of combining assistance with offensive operations, the “military-civilian activities” service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at rebuilding agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with intensive local labour, were able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing arable land.
What will we leave to ourselves by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help to improve the living conditions of the local population, who are very harsh in these valleys, often above 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in Kapis province.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, what farmers want, as they said, is to provide them with a little non-military support that is well controlled and directly available to them.
The Hard Births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is President Mohammed Mursi's new risky move.
While Egypt is more than ever divided on a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it emergency powers, it has decided to play a wa bank.
After taking everyone by surprise, he announced Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the Head of State granted the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
It was soon two years after Egypt had relied on a preliminary text, which had been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only reinforced the country ' s division.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusions" by continuing to "break the word" and "prevent the right."
In the camp, his followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that compels the Brothers to abandon their intention to explain the text to the Egyptians, article after article.
It is also a way for the President to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he stated in an interview to the American Time weekly.
Especially since the call for an accelerated vote is similar to the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: "Or do you vote for my text, or do I leave myself with extraordinary powers," which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to communicate their views.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to achieve the required quorum, 11 alternate participants were added hastily yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
No wonder the articles were voted unanimously in most cases.
Commentators, by the way, have been amused by the fact that one of the few differences of the day has arisen around... the time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the Constituent Assembly hours were wrong.
The text on which the vote was still pending yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, article 2, was ultimately identical to the article in the 1971 Constitution, which states that “Shari'a principles are the principal source of law”.
Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law was a basic requirement, had hoped to replace “principles” with “rules”, which would have made their application more stringent.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Physicians," the liberals, who see it as nothing but PR.
Because, in their view, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with sharia law.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pomieux, this is alarming, i.e. “people who are called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can observe the birth of theocracy."
Many liberals are also agitated by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current one.
"There is currently no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain under civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulems, but people with university education, some of whom have studied in the French system," comforts Alexis Bloe, who prepares a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that “article 220 may give rise to ambiguity, as the terms used in it are drawn from religious language.
This applies in particular to "fikh" [Islamic jurisprudence, p. 25].
In the future, the question may arise as to whether civilian judges are competent to rule on this.”
In addition to its religious dimension, the text adopted yesterday has been criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have decreased significantly compared to those of the old regime.
Another controversial point is the power of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will not be considered in Parliament but in the National Defence Council.
The trial of civilians before military courts would also not be prohibited, despite the requests of human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they considered to be harmful to freedom.
Blasphemy was retained, and insults were now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of speech, especially freedom of the press.
Furthermore, none of the articles ever speak of the protection of a woman any more, emphasizes Heba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
The only positive development, she said, was the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was scheduled to perform on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the Head of State, in turn, will go to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Poop of Earth and the sea from the Rasole
The Promised Land combines the greatness of Bible truths, modern comfort, and the primordial nature.
AiF highlighted five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Let's worship the holy places.
It is worth visiting at the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that everyone who enters this "buy" is granted God's grace.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus ’ wonders: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking through the water, calming the storm, and filling the nets.
Here, Jesus appeared before his disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all the shrines in Jerusalem.
Those who believe here pass the Path of Sorbie or the Cross Path of Jesus (in Latin, Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the Fortune of Antonia - Pretoria - where there was a trial, and in the streets of the Old City leads to the Temple of the Lord's Grove on Mount Golgofe - to the site of the crucifixion, the Stone of Anointment, and the place of burial of Jesus.
Here lies the symbolic Christian Pup of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be erected in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew out of which a cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is also the most holy place for the Jews, the Wall of Crying, remaining from a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different confessionals leave briefs here with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Travel Vertically
The ruins of Massad's fortress remained from a secret refuge from enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on high cliffs in the mountains at 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are attracted to climbing can reach them.
The rest are being delivered to this historic peak by a lift along a rope road.
And in the north of the country, there is a famous Hermon ski resort at 1600-2040 metres, which during the winter months is a huge influx of tourists.
A shuttle bus comes to him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski tracks is 45 km.
According to ancient tradition, pagan gods supposedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You don't get to go to all of them for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting ones, are worth a visit.
These include the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It is also worth visiting the Museum of Arts in Tel Aviv.
His exhibition features extensively the paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Moné, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matissa, Modigliani, Chagaal, Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the Al Basha Ban Museum, which is a number of rooms in old Turkish baths with models of visitors and banpers of the time.
In Ceysaria, you should go to the unique Private Museum of Rally, where you can watch the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There are no tour guides or souvenir shops.
The entry is free and donations are categorically rejected.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the children's memorial, is built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it and you're in total darkness.
The stars are fading.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are being used.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Healthy.
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is bathed even during the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 degrees Fahrenheit] and the air warms up to 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 degrees Fahrenheit].
The dead sea is even warmer, and there they swim all year round.
By the way, this is the world's most extraordinary sea at the lowest point of the planet, 417 metres below sea level.
The azure water in it is a sprinkler that can easily keep afloat even those who can't swim.
The landscapes around here are incredibly beautiful.
They come here to undergo treatment with salt water — rapa, and healing mud — and to treat the health of dermatites, allergies, asthmas, eczemas, arthrites, bronchites, diabetes mellitus, to clean up the shattered nerves.
Touch the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffo on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
He passed through the famous Sea Way, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, this is where Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists love to wander the narrow streets named after Zodiac signs.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your own sign, Fortune will be favored.
In Jaffo, you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries at a photo shoot.
And in Ceysaria, the city of King Herod, you can wander through the Roman theatre, take the fortress of the Crusaders.
In the Roman period, Ceysaria was the principal city of Judea and residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontia Pilate.
A carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
A tourist for a note.
When going to Israel, don’t worry about your imperfect English: about 30% of the population know Russian.
It is better to take money on a trip, not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now $1 - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mostly buses, but Jerusalem has a speed tram, and Haifa has the country's only six-station subway line linking the Lower City to Upper Town.
It's basically an underground funiculer.
Travel in all modes of urban transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Sabbath is celebrated according to Jewish tradition.
From Friday evening until sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, and public transport are shut down.
And Sunday morning begins the week of work.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and foods that combine milk with meat.
There is a large choice of lamb and beef, soup and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish paste hummus, a variety of sauces, balls of hammered nutus - falalalels, fruits, and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of fed cats that go out on their own.
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Murlyks love crowded places and don't refuse treats.
The rental of the car, depending on the stamp, will cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus the insurance is $15 a day.
It'll cost 15 sheks a day to rent a bike.
The tickets to the museum cost an average of 30 shekels.
by the numeric language
In 2012, over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
The most frequent visitors to travel and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine.
The Promised Land was visited by 118,800 Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, an increase of 51 per cent from 2010, prior to the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
The Great and Powerful One will lead to Moscow: Migrants save money in their language
While MPs and human rights defenders are arguing that the law on compulsory language testing will give rise to frauds that sell "lip" certificates.
Each year 13 million gastarbiters arrive in Moscow, Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to support families left in their homeland.
As of 1 December, a law had entered into force requiring every migrant worker to take a Russian language test.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in service, housing, utilities, welfare and retail.
In time, however, the tests will become mandatory for all visitors, as promised by the FMS.
At the same time, not only language, but also Russian history, and the basics of legislation, will have to be surrendered.
Language skills will have to be confirmed for both obtaining and extending work permits.
The exception applies only to nationals of countries where Russian is the State language.
Nor are people who were able to obtain diplomas and diplomas before the break-up of the USSR in 1991 subject to the law.
Benefits, doomedness and protection of rights
The network of examination posts will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the MGU, the SPbGU and other Russian universities.
Migrants would be able to pass tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres had already opened in Russia.
Both members of the State Duma and the FMS supported the initiative to introduce testing.
Human rights defenders, before the law came into force, had asked the press many times: what would that actually do?
What will change the binding knowledge of the language for both Russians and visitors?
First of all, the migration service answers, which will reduce the number of people suffering from “labour slavery”.
Many people are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, as explained by Victor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment system would solve 90 per cent of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession or an education that does not know a language without a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, I'm sure a future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of aid, will stick him in a terrible, narrow barracks, where he and dozens of his kind will be languishing for months without food and documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"In their home country, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, their passports are taken away, and they do not pay the promised wages," confirms the head of the General Directorate of Labour Migration of the Ministry of Labour of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't fight, asshole!
However, as long as many citizens of the Central Asian Republics gather for earnings in Russia, it is recognized that not only do they not know the language of the country to which they aspire, but they also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as their trouble: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even a good primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to feed their children, let alone dress them properly, wear them, and equip them in school.
Growing up to adolescence, these guys go to work as soon as possible.
It's hard if you don't know your language, they'll admit it.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Indeed, with regard to the language law, human rights defenders have noted one important point.
The test will be conducted only for those migrants with legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the gastarbiters still live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome, or the outsiders are banned"
Many of the visitors claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and the same language difficulties.
Besides, legalization costs money: 12,000 to 16,000 rubles.
But a false registration can be made quickly and for only 1,500.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence extortion cases.
"A hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," spoke to journalists by Tajik citizen Umed Khushkadamov.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy the painting."
On the first day of entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that not only migrant registration documents were false.
Several "lip" language test certificates have already been withdrawn by FMS staff.
The fake papers are printed on a normal color printer.
Of course, they were given to new owners at no cost: each of the migrants, hoping in this way to make it easier for themselves to pass the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as expensive as the official testing procedure: it will cost a working migrant of 3,000.
The main challenge in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the “bottoms” cannot simply be bought, and the authorities and human rights defenders alike agree.
In the meantime, authorities can promise gastarbaters who have not been able to pass the test from the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, those who do not know Russian will be offered jobs in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not trade illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to tighten the law on the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: Pushing shots at weddings without casualties, and the slaughter by Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
Police officers want to prohibit the wearing of injuries in public places and raise the age at which a gun licence can be obtained from the age of 18 to the age of 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, and promised that the arms law would be amended in the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to combat the problem by “turning the nuts”.
An open letter has appeared on the network that the authors of various public gun organizations demand that the “unconsequential tightening” be avoided.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, as stated by the Russian BBC criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 142 firearms offences were committed in six months of 2012 registered with the internal affairs agencies, while 1,168,000 offences were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of civil weapons legislation does not place the perpetrator in the black market.
Now, they say, you can find any weapons in Moscow at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims to control the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Vendors: from factories to officers
The black arms market is being replenished through several channels.
The main channels are five, told by retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who served ten years with the Ministry of Education and General Staff.
Screenshot of the website receiving the weapons orders
The first is "Army or military trail", which is a weapon that was stolen during the battles in the Caucasus.
"Russian officers and Caucasians carried weapons," says the Baran.
The next type of black weapon was stolen by criminals from the security forces.
The baran explains that this includes both stolen from police warehouses and stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal "royals" are off the market from military warehouses.
There have been frequent explosions in many military warehouses.
"There are proven accounts that some of the arsons were made specifically to cover up the shortfall," said the former military.
The arms manufacturers, according to Barantz, are making their contribution.
"Personal weapons plants are now being produced that fail to compete in the international market and throw weapons from under the floor into the black market, including Moscow," the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Especially do guns and assault rifles come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production there, sometimes handicrafty, and there is a mob that has organized the flow," the former military explains.
Where's the weapon coming from?
The experts considered what the approximate share of each source of illicit arms to the black market was.
A report on this was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design in 2011.
Experts analysed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Russian State, criminological literature and public data from portals on weapons issues.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, written by researchers, come from the army and the security agencies.
Half of the weapons on the black market were “in the hands of officials whose work is related to weapons”, the report states.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons originate from armed conflict, 14 per cent from theft during the weapons production phase, and 5 per cent from “black archaeology”.
The consultant seller of one of the gun stores, who asked not to name his name, assures me that the weapons found by the black diggers have not been purchased in a long time, too old.
Most of the time, he says, the sellers follow the new party to the military warehouse.
Through an officer-in-chief, a person buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
He's being discharged, passed through the fence.
"He transports it to the city and here sells 900 euros per thing with two stores," he says.
"Truly, the police are aware of all the cases, so from time to time, when a crime-disclosure plan is on fire, they conduct a control purchase from illegal arms dealers," adds the consultant.
"As in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the websites, on the blog, until a comrade responded, who offered to come to the Begow platform, where there would be a man who would take me to the corner, where we would bargain.
I only found out the price of the gun there.
Military columnist Victor Baranets
To get a gun, I need a friend who has a way out, says the consultant salesman.
There are salesmen in the markets, but there's also to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to tell you that his daughter's tooth fell out."
I'm even getting a couple of casts right now through the person I'm sure of.
He's only supplying them to me, too, because he knows I'm not turning them in.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Barantz tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he prepared an article about it for publication.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
They gave him an album with photos where there was "anything."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranz, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I'm not just buying, I'm not just buying, we're going to the woods with the seller, and I'm putting in a target.
"I'm given the opportunity to shoot, and when I'm convinced the weapon is hitting well, we start to bargain," the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the couch.
Internet searchers bring sites and groups to Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons for "different purposes."
You don't need any documents or face-to-face meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in an ad hat on "Buy a gun or a gun."
Users leave their applications and ask questions.
Will the minors be sold?
"Without license of course," asks the user Ivan (orthography saved).

I've heard of such schemes: the site is usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes payment through the ATM.
"In response, a photograph and instruction are sent where the weapons are hidden," says Dmitri Kislov, a spokesperson for the right to arms organization.

$100 macarov.
In the purchase of illegal small arms, experts estimate that between $100 and $900 can be paid.
According to Dmitri Kislov of Right to Arms, Makarov's gun can be purchased for $100 to $300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage facilities by the middle-level warehouse management.
According to official statistics, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole declined by 7 per cent from January to October 2011, to 22.9 thousand, and the number of reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, fast food workers and supermarkets strike
The MacDonalds account runs through a quarter of all U.S. teenagers.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests across America against low salaries in Walmart Corporation department stores and restaurants of popular fast food networks such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Belle, Wendis and Kentucky Fride Chiken.
As long as no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth shaft or be expected to breathe into the early stages.
The shares are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries received by Walmart and fast-food workers, the protesters aim to establish trade union organizations in them.
As yet, this sector of the economy is almost unaffected by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The stock started last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sales that captured millions of visitors and sometimes accompanied by fights.
On that day, some employees of Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and picketed, along with trade unions and left-wing activists, the corporation's stores, whose goods are valued at people of modest and medium wealth.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in his stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of Walmart's low-paying workers only cook at their jobs.
The availability and range of goods made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods cheap partly because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of car loaders or hand scanners.
Shareholders on Black Friday demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart employee who receives $9.5 per hour, they said, this spending is beyond their means.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost corporations $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than she's spending on wages now.
If Walmart puts the whole salary increase on the buyer's shoulders, every visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year, they'll be spending some $12.39 more than they're spending now.
Walmart supporters quite note that protests took place in only nine states and did not cause any damage to corporations.
Black Friday continued in her stores from 8 p.m. Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cashiers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Representative Dan Vogelman of the Corporation claimed in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs, and that the protest was just a "other pear trick" by the union that organized her.
"Free till!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not targeted by Walmart department stores (they are not complained of in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), but by the McDonalds and other cheap restaurants.
MacDonalds says he sells billions of drinks, and after that, he doesn't even give you sick leave and pay you for an honest job!
Jumaine Williams, member of the City Council of New York
The current minimum wage, under federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Restaurants increase it over time, but not much, and on average their private workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York City.
No one earns less in this dear city.
How can you exist in New York City with that kind of money, it's incomprehensible to me.
Back in the day, the Macdonalds passed almost a quarter of American teenagers who were working for their counters after school, living with their parents.
Few have seen this as the main source of food or have planned to stay there for a long time.
Right now, I'm constantly running into interviews with McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live on that salary and sometimes even feed on it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum, there is a comment, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them.
The protesters, who began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at the McDonalds on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks start paying at least $15 per hour, more than doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the area of fast food.
The American law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing trade unionists with darings and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their lives.
But it is difficult for the union to include fast food for objective reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
Dissenting
Noise protests took place on that day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The event culminated in a midday rally at the McDonalds near Times Square, featuring several local Democrat politicians, in particular City Councilman Jumain Williams, who said, "Macdonalds says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you sick and pay you for honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as the city's mayor candidate Bill De Blacio, who stated that "we must join hands in supporting fast food workers to achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!".
As the New York Times described, it was the largest of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated, and not all of them were fast-food workers, who employed tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will generate the flames of mass motion.
"As long as it's medium-sized to cheat the brain."
A popular theme among the fans of modern technology has recently been accepted mainly through the prism of special points.
First at its annual conference in the summer, Google showed the current model, and then in November it was revealed that Microsoft had applied for the relevant patent.
However, from a conversation with the team leader of the interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge Microsoft Laboratory, Sharam Izadi indicates that for the scientists of the company, the glasses are the past stage.
They are drawn by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Can you tell me what your research team is doing, please?
We're working on human interaction with machines, but we're trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
While mankind is caught in the mass at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes the pointing in them is a finger.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and anticipate fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is sold, because everybody is interested in gesture control.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Despite Kinect's physical exposure, much is still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has improved (the system receives more data) and the output is not yet very good.
We're trying to change that, we're working on really three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
To do so, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And above all, to hell with these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
Popular stuff, but isn't it overrated?
- It's definitely not a panacea - it's a question of privacy, because you don't always want to let people know what you're doing and what you're doing.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in their niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about wavelengths, but about so cheap, short.
The gestures were not made by a camera device, but by a hand bracelet that fixed the movement of the bones and muscles.
So far, it's large, but in theory, it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is behind a mixed type of management, like a gesture+voice.
- How's that?
- Like, how do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You'll say it and you'll show it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what a machine can or can't do right now?
- It's not necessary, but it's a rapprochement.
I think we're going to have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to define human responses more accurately.
It could be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it's very important.
- Speaking of your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what's your problem with modern cameras?
Lack of permission, depth, or something?
- In principle, the present generation is something to be expected from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it'd be good to get megapixels 8 at 1,000 k/s.
But it's not about the megapixels themselves, it's about the matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, which adds work to the algorithm designers.
So you have to remember not only the X-and-Y-axis resolution, but also Z.
The speed, the number of frames per second is also very important.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and today's 30 k/s are frankly not enough, especially for signs.
Stephen Betishes of our Radmond Lab made a sensor of the controlled processing delay of between 1 and 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how that affects the interaction between humans and machines.
I could really use the equivalent of this device in my job, but it doesn't need to be touched so that there's more footage in a second.
- Don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
There are now three cameras in Kinect, one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the other is a reflector receiver.
Now, the third camera is actually the normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of an object.
A potentially larger number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the amount of calculation required.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue, play with the curvature of the cameras, and see how it helps in a three-dimensional position determination.
- As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present her glasses to the public.
Don't you think in terms of the day-to-day use of the technology of the enhanced reality of glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, it's not very convenient to walk around with a smartphone in your hands, but I think the coolest option would be a "changing" added reality, where on a cloud platform you could switch from points to a smartphone, a projection display and everything else.
Glasses are a very personal device, in which their power (private things only you see) and at the same time weakness - an added reality based on points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Let's imagine for a minute that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to a mere mortal.
There is one problem that is often criticized by critics of such an idea: no tactful response!
Hands can't feel anything!
What answers are your team preparing for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that the added reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be an addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is using the second hand as an image substrate.
She's a great recorder!
But there are technologies that are actually aimed at giving these "cartoons in the air" a touch -- for example, interference with a few directional ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is located -- gives a sense, but so far it's very weak -- like you've been blown on your pillows.
There are bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Did you try to cheat the brain?
Make him think that he feels what he's supposed to feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
There is yet another challenge to be overcome for a long time to come -- how to make a person physically in a very limited space believe it goes on open, almost endless -- work on the concepts of treadmills (other than clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
As long as it's medium-sized to cheat the brain, it's very long-term work.
That's what makes working on a virtual reality so attractive to a researcher -- many things in a totally embryonic state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.
Rosbalt continues the Petersburg avant-garde project on the forward citizens in the avant-garde of culture and art.
This top list has already reached the bright figures of the Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, without all Russian fame.
The new character "Rosbalta" is the epic artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red, who meets at the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, and the fashion parties and vernisage.
Cyril Miller's paintings always gather crowds of viewers wherever they are displayed.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely Peterburg socio-philosophian fairy tales creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller is a bright man of the Peterburg avant-garde of the late '80s and early '90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city who, in his appearance on the streets, is smiling at the citizens, raising the mood of everyone.
He recently took control of the charm and became a Peterburg charmer, as he matured for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you walking around town in all red, not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a fashion designer.
In this world, red is a compromise between artist, imagemaker and society.
Although everything in society that's a little grey causes aggression and badness.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative acts is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at DC Nevsky, where my work was exhibited.
I knew it was my way.
Then a wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free types of me were obscured.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gasoness that led to Pushkin's 10, and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into the theater, clothes, music, all but the word.
It was important for me to be in the center of Petersburg culture, where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied territory on Pushkin's 10th, and there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, and a peterburg Bohemian home there until repair.
Many were born there: NOWes, Tequila Jazz, remember Shnoor brought in with Project Van Gogh's ear.
Schnur and his friends sang under the plywood of light songs, they were in a tight tight, among them the fashionable now composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band got live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs until the Hali-Galivan times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career followed, and he received basic education and training.
The D 137 Gallery, the Griboeds Club, are echoes from Art Clinics.
That's where our workers and regulars left.
I'm a hero of yesterday's century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "The People of Our City."
The Artist of the Year nomination named me, ended my climax.
In new times it's awkward to work under old rules, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are shared, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work has a recognizable manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they're highly relevant and acute.
I'm going to have a program exhibition, "Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are an out-of-time category.
I used to be social, now that I'm like this, it hurts and it's scary.
But in clowns, everything is blurred, tragedy is lifted.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through totalitarian dressing in order of order.
They're now wearing clothes, focusing on external mechanics, not on the inside person.
Maybe you can't give him a hand and spit in the face.
And the deception will be removed by changing.
And recently, we saw you as a city charmer.
Who am I to be?
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful.
- Now commercial art must be neat, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are disintegrating.
People used to go down into packs, like God's one thing, like another.
Now everyone's broken up into microcommunities, and now it's hard for everyone to enjoy.
I'm not a hundred-dollar piece of paper for everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And there's a few thousand on Stas Mikhaylov!
- He gets dumped, he's got sex and social work.
And on cultural grounds, 300 people will come, and 10,000 won't come, and eventually less management, less money, everything will go away.
I've got fans, and the most important thing is not to cheat them, not to ruin what I've learned.
I used to write paintings like this when I was a kid, one of the collectors had them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that usually end.
It's a lot of things that are confusing right now.
They say culture is spiritual, culture of consumption.
There's no culture in consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, growing up with examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, giving up money to paint pictures.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing for Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It's a cultural official.
But not every one of them can engage in culture.
Under the right kings, things were wrong, kings may not have understood much in culture, but they did realize that they needed to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow right now.
We in Petersburg have people who could be experts, but they're advanced, because we need higher-level experts who would appreciate these experts properly and give them a way.
There's a good taste in it right now.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should be looking for other museums.
- What is it for you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil.
And on our stones, the art is hard to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, it's wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of thinness.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented with funding from St. Petersburg grant
To be born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Spaceships with Earthlings on board are going to search for a backup planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question arises as to how to continue their lineage under conditions of weightlessness or on the same backup planet?
I think it's a small choice.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," says P.C. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAISH) senior researcher Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus are temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in Venus' orbit... in space.
To approach reproduction issues in space began with flora.
We had plant experiments half a century ago.
Four generations of in-orbit peas were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then it's the orbiting of insects, tiny fruit drosophile flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to check on the development of the embryo in conditions of weightlessness.
We get a perfectly normal chick on the way out.
And then the problem begins.
"The problem that this chick has to find support, he has to stand on his feet and start moving," explained the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of RA Vladimir Sychev.
When the chicks did not find the support, they were running around in a random manner.
And ten hours later, newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
Birds did not react to light and sound.
And the trouble there was that four days later, they just died.
"And twice we hatched the chicks, then refused, because it's simply impossible to work with them," notes the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space by Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last time a biological "minocoche" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only same-sex individuals will be on the Bion biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with a fetus.
In principle, nothing supernatural was discovered there.
"It was on biosatellites, but again it's a single experiment, and such research needs to be done," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
But it is not yet possible to address the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, just can't realize their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike animals, can, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a proper emotional background.
Such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkova had the biggest risk.
And the most precious thing mankind has is the female organism.
Our Teapot flew away, and no one on Earth could say if it would survive after flying into space.
Will she be able to have a baby after this flight?
"Because no one answered that question," says Vakhtang Wachnadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after flying into space, Valentina Tereshkov's first female cosmonaut gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child, Andriaan Nikolaev, was also an astronaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitska, who had twice been in orbit and even worked in outer space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have many astronauts, and after long flights, everything's worked out, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it's dangerous even in orbit flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia Valery Polakov.
Yet mankind needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, artificial gravity.
The CDC Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, under conditions of zero buoyancy, astronauts develop open space skills.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If the water is comfortable for adults, but it's a strange environment, it's a natural environment for babies.
The little ichtianders seem to confirm that life on land is out of the ocean.
There's a connection between having a baby in mom's fertilized fluid for about nine months and getting used to the water.
In principle, that makes sense, because from the moment of birth, from the time of that first bathing, it only takes two weeks.
"That's very little to forget," says the breast-navigation instructor Marina Aksenov.
In other words, if the weightlessness of the baby is more natural, then the gravity, gravity, is necessary for the woman.
Very quickly in weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, the pelvis, and the ability to push the fetus declines.
All right, let's put that down by relying on birth stimulants.
Of course, we can go to labor in a special cell, she'll push him out.
"And then what?" asks the nontrivial questions Valery Polakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Unfeeling Earth's attraction, the organism will not form a skeleton and a muscular system.
It's impossible to put a newborn in orbit like an adult in a special load suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he needs.
"And this experiment, which you and I will go on by allowing a child to be born in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring to Earth a disabled person who is completely disadapted," the head of the Bioethics Committee of the IMBP RA Igor Pestov predicts.
As long as the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, in time it will be a reality when the Earthers on their ships travel to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Chief of the General Audit and Audit Office: Checking the Schwartz system failed by politicians.
In the public procurement industry, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the existence of quality legislation, is lagging behind in its implementation.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for the website Aktuálnă.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack," commented on Cal's current situation.
Such findings are provided by a joint inspection of the Czech and German monitoring bodies.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter Necchat's approach to the so-called Schwartz system is cited.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the DDP (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is this prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits anything, neither the Prime Minister can oppose the work of the institutions that are obliged to verify and enforce obligations”, Kala notes.
At an audit committee meeting in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which public procurement legislation of both countries was compared.
What exactly were we talking about?
It means a parallel check that we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation affirms how public procurement should take place, national legislation follows and then also applies in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even with the pending verification, interesting differences have emerged - in simple terms, our legislation may be “precise and unmistakable”, but in practice we are inferior to Germany in some respects.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but to focus on the application of the law itself.
How does this project really help you, what does it mean to you?
It is such joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop clarifying laws, reducing and improving restrictions, because it does not produce a positive result.
Economy means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not a fact that we're going to achieve this by reducing the limitation of orders.
It is possible that the system will be filled with “papers” so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not decreased.
You're talking about internal problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
How does the German control system function?
Is there an organization like our CRU or does it work differently?
As far as institutions are concerned, our CRU is a Bundesrechnungshof based on our principle, and there is also a panel that works a little differently, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.
Moreover, the powers are to some extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the federal level as well - their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Accounts Chambers.
As for local legislation, is it easier than we are?
Actually, I don't want to compare without specific data, but in some respects, Germany is a model, but it's not certain that it's better at everything.
Is that because they're better at control?
Certainly not, but again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it must be said that even model countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any advantage from cooperating with our office, would they?
With regard to domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affect your establishment, do the consequences appear in some way?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet been shown in our monitoring work.
As we monitor the fact, some delay must be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future audits - we have started using our new tool of "detecting the risk of non-economy" through which we ran almost 14,000 government contracts, we analyzed them, of course, because these changes are going to occur because the restrictions are changing, the terms of some types of tenders are changing, and so on.
Do you believe that the approval of this law will bring benefits or additional burdens to the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that might arise was that the rules would be “strengthened” and could not be respected.
In previous regulations, controlled enterprises are associated with a supplier (e.g., regional operational programmes with a regional council) in that any non-compliance with the public procurement law means budgetary discipline.
Should the law then be tightened in this way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who commit a formal error that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only put even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us be aware that this journey will not lead anywhere.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the SPD would not bother entrepreneurs with checks on the so-called Schwartz system.
Is the Schwartz system banned or authorized?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibited anything, the Prime Minister could not oppose the work of bodies that were obliged to verify and enforce obligations.
You can say, "We're gonna change this law and let it go," but you can't say we're gonna pretend like nothing's going on.
The Public Procurement Act contains quite strict rules, as and what should be formally carried out, and that is correct, which will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it's tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal flaws.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I think we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowy.
They're mostly passing, but somewhere with greater caution.
Carlovarsky Krai
Roads were crossed this morning in the Carlovar province, but somewhere frozen and snowy.
Temperature has dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but should warm a little during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, with only a small layer in the lowlands.
However, on the ridges of the Rud Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
According to information received from regional road workers, the places were lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 speed highway and first-class roads in the region are currently passing without restrictions.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be frosty and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third grades, including mountain tracks, are passed.
But in some of their areas, there are still remnants of frozen snow and places of stopped snow.
You need to be particularly attentive on the roads on the highlands.
Pardubitsky and Kralovegradec Krai
The Czech Highway and Highway Authority reports on its Internet pages that some roads in eastern Czech Republic are threatened by holodeck, and mountain roads and roads on highlands may contain a flooded layer of snow.
District road workers warn drivers of a holodeck, which can be formed especially on the highlands of Pardubic province.
Gololed may be near Lanschkrone, Usti nad Orlitzi, Policki, Sweetavi or Visoke Mito especially on second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located near Sweetawi, are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkonoshe and the Orlitz Mountains.
The stopped snow layer is on roads located on highlands in the areas of Richnova nad Knezhnow and Trutnov.
In Eastern Czech Republic today, the variable cloud is rain-free.
Temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Pilsen edge
The roads in Plzena Province are passing this morning, but places need to be careful and adapted to weather.
In the morning, temperatures range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling, it may be slippery in some places.
Locally, drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
Information was provided by regional road workers.
Highway D5 now runs almost without restrictions, but road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a dry and extinct surface.
In southern Plzny and Takhova, there may be frozen sites.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and there is also a warning for the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the few roads in the Shumava area.
Olomouk Krai
Drivers heading to the highlands of the Olomouc region must now account for snow porridge on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Czerwenogorian saddle and on the road to Videl Krshij.
During the night, snow caused traffic workers to enter the street, according to traffic control information, about three centimeters of snow fell in Schumperk.
In other parts of the province, roads are generally run without restrictions.
"On the highlands of Schumper lie remnants of snow.
Drivers heading towards Jesenik must bear in mind the presence of snow porridge in the Czerwenogorian saddle," said CHAN (Czech News Agency) today, the noiseperk road manager.
During the night, their colleagues from Jesenik went to clear the roads, and they assured them that the roads on the highlands had remained naked and wet after the chemicals had been treated.
In Olomouz, roads are not restricted, but in Sternberg, drivers must be alert to forest areas where humidity is still present.
Ustec Krai, Liberec Krai
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are a few difficult places left.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with hololed or falling snow, a mountain road from Telnica to the Clinic in Ustec Kray has been closed.
The temperature also remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Middle Mountain, on the contrary, there is no problem, the roads are mostly dry.
Road complications have not yet been reported.
Traffic workers report the appearance of a holod in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for his formation at night - all day raining and melting snow, the sky cleared up at night and freezing began.
Adverse conditions are reported on the main highway and on I/13 on the border between Ustecki and Liberetsk Province.
Due to the curved branches of trees beneath the snow, touching the road itself, were forced to close the road to Tellice on Knitz.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we humans are so easily caught up in.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we constantly joke on this subject and say that we are the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you're going to give three entirely unique concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell the readers more about this?
This is a national fund-raising exercise that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which ended on 21 December at 11:10.
The day before this event, December 20th, at 9 p.m., three concerts will run parallel in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, in short, when the May calendar ends on Kiribati Island in the Pacific, whose time zone is 12 hours ahead of us.
Who thought of this idea?
It was originally my idea, and then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to building up enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to reflect with the public on the state in which this world will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, which can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz and thus support us.
The Tap Tap band, along with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world called "The end of the world is cancelled".
Will the anthem already enjoyed by YouTube listeners sound at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if it all works out and the world doesn't end.
He'll be singing all the performers at all the concerts at the same time.
Gymns will also sound at the same time on Czech television live.
Words to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the video Tomas Ganak, is also involved in the execution of Xindl X...
How did you start cooperating with them?
We also cooperate with other individuals in Czech cultural life, as we have many charitable events and concerts.
We are trying to actively involve them in these projects.
Turns out a lot of people like working with us, they're interested.
What will the proceeds of the concert against the end of the world go to?
For the purchase of equipment for the barrierless educational centre STUDEO, for the sixth year we've been doing this with the civil association Tap at the Jedlica Institute.
Teachers regularly attend and have fun and interesting activities with students at Edlicchi Institute schools.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we are trying in this way to give them this opportunity.
As part of the Supplementary Construction Project of the Edlichki Institute, in the future we will create a separate building to which we will move with the project.
There will be several music bands and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We've been trying to design a program that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustrosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiři Suhi will be featured in Prague.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any similar “grandiastic events” in the future?
We'll be performing for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival in May, and we'll certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would love to have a performance at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we're in the United States, would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
About the overseas, you have serious plans, you've already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it looks.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs have to travel in the luggage room, plus a lot of cargo and toolboxes.
However, for the time being, the Czech airlines ČSA and British airlines have always been excellently prepared for us, which has surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
By travelling abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards persons with disabilities, and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we do in Russia, we have seen that in the east we are still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are very many barriers, and this is still a wildly independent movement of a person in an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
It's also out of the way of such common things as giving way to a handicapped person in an elevator.
Fortunately, social organizations are already emerging that try to draw people ' s attention to the problems of persons with disabilities.
What, on the contrary, should we always catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's normal for people with severe disabilities to travel on their own on the streets, to go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in public life, in which we and The Tap Tap are slightly ahead of them!
Respect for the public or non-barrierness is one thing, but the moment we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything will really change.
As long as these are isolated cases, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, but back two years ago, which in 1998 made you organize it?
I went to the Edlichki Institute as a teacher, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician myself and I play a saxophone, I've organized an interesting music club with a colleague.
Well, in time, as our host Lada Angelovich says, it's gotten a little out of hand (laughs).
Popularity has only come in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It's true, it helped us that we started joining famous singers and actively working on promoting the band.
We have come to the conclusion that work that no one can appreciate is, in fact, as if there were no such thing.
With the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have the goal of developing The Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
Show business is full of things imitating one another.
It makes sense, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us is, of course, pity, it's natural...
But this pity is completely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all the abandoned individuals we must pity.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities do something, it's a shift not just for them, but for the whole community.
Did it succeed that you are a strict leader, as many people think you are?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic representation and fly in the clouds, and when they find out they have to practice twice a week, attend preparatory courses, and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, there are twenty members of The Tap Tap.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place one day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brno at the Fléda and Ostrava Club at Plynojem Center, featuring 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are joined by a telecast at the time of the performance of The Tap Tap's song "The end of the world is cancelled".
The aim of the project is to raise funding of 25 million kroner to purchase multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Jedlicka Institute in Prague.
The concert ticket is 400 kroner, free entry for children under 12 years of age, and you can buy tickets in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency, Poland was accepted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and has participated actively in a number of Agency projects over the following years.
But the path to space Poland started a lot earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were involved in space flights, but this was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who on 6 December 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work "Introduction to Space Science" at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory.
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltry and André Luis Hirsch Award for Induction into Space.
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899–1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and space science.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a world-renowned space promoter, and his contribution was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the opposite side of the Moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway dredger equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as did the details of the project.
It's not even clear that a rocket should have been used to disperse or to stop the trolley.
Information about this drezine is only known from the press of that era.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has begun to think about rocket arrows.
The study was carried out by the Weapons Technology Section with the cooperation of Professors Mázyslav Wolfke and Gustav Mokzytsky.
Remaining materials show that the studies have reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photovoltaic fighter rocket, proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, appeared in a specialized press, and the following year the work of the "Aerobic torpedo missile and the aerial bomb" by author Lelivi-Cjioblocchi came out.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war itself, all military missile projects were handled by the Temporary Scientific and Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended due to the outbreak of war.
The next research work on space science appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of society is in the November 1954 issue of Problem magazine, which publishes four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich offered to organize a society that would be involved in space activities.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) has tried to join an international federation of astronautics (founded in 1951), and as early as autumn, the PAA became a valid member.
The following year, the first president of PAA, Kazimez Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became the vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PAA has made a significant contribution to the development of a highly successful RM meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologyzna), which was the first Polish missile to perform a scientific study.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile, capable of crossing a distance of 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
An improved version of the RM-1A was subsequently built, and a two-stage RM-2 missile was tested on the Bledov Desert in the summer of 1959.
The missile was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could have crossed 14.5 km, and its mission was to observe the high wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The first RM-type missiles were succeeded by the Meteor-1 missile, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was conceived as two-stage, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed which varied the size of the chamber for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A missile had a volume of 0.4 litres, the Meteor-1V had a volume of 0.34 litres and the Meteor-1C had a volume of 0.62L.
All three types had a maximum range of 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, a Meteor-2 missile was developed at the Aviation Institute and its first flight trials began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket, with an initial weight of 380 kg, was capable of bringing a useful weight of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
Mention should also be made of Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR national committee two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Public Works Act.
The ruling sparked a lively debate in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is linked to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of the large difference in the value of the labour force (wages), there is a price tension.
This notion should be understood to mean the condition that a producer, through the delivery of cheap goods, tries to stand up to economic competition by “pulling” the value of a competitor in order to take a large part of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a massive scale, this means that most entrepreneurs either move production abroad, buy cheaply abroad or disappear, leading to higher unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to others.
Since private capital has no social responsibility, including for its unemployment, the inevitable social spending of the State is increasing.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of business masters to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social economic and social damage they cause in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
Ceremony methods of private capital create situations at the level of individual economies where national Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their populations in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, Governments have abandoned their own populations to private capital despite social declines.
This is reflected above all in the changes to existing legislation.
The aim is to make their people economically comply with the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a means of reducing workers ' rights in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty increases, while the gap between the poor and the rich increases.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, there has been a public distribution of food to the poor for several years who are unable to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is already close to a million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are ongoing cases where employed persons receive such wages that the State must pay them more to ensure that they receive the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal has also become known to the public in the case of additional Bundestag workers.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU states undoubtedly result in the same state in which people under the pressure of a disastrous decline in social status are forced either to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live on a poor salary on the margins of society, hoping that private investment capital will one day enter the country.
I wonder, though, where will he come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still work for a share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media are nauseous to argue that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the State should not interfere with the economy by the managers.
The next question to be answered is whether private capital, now practically in charge of politics and the whole state, is not working for its own selfish ends?
The obvious answer is yes.
Evidence is the existence of virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all States.
As a result, we have a desperate situation of corruption, mutual benefit, in legislation where almost everyone deserves punishment but is not a crime.
The situation in the Federal Republic of Germany is that, due to a lack of funding, government ministries entrust the drafting of bills to private law firms, which are closely associated with industry.
Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western Constitution states, but from financial-power groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly finding itself in a situation as described by Appian in the work "Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompeii": "The State has long been disintegrating, and agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribes, illegal receiving of mercy with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any ban, and the people went to the election with a pre-sold vote" ... decent people did not run for the office of ruler at all, eventually one day the state was left without a consul for eight months." "In fact, the only salvation in this terrible situation was self-control and the need to choose a energetic man." Appian thought it would be Pompey, but it was Caesar who finally changed democracy to self-power.
As in antiquity, today's society is dominated by its own reckless interests without regard for public interest.
Private capital is no longer inherently intended for public use.
The present result is no different from the past: the unparalleled decline of the elite without any attempt at deeper reforms.
So we must look for the cause of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalization of economic systems for 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, or at least not a permanent solution.
Under pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the State and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: The chaos lab.
"It won't come out of violence, and it can never come out" - Sting, the song 'Fast', where the main verse of the refreen is the words 'don't forget how fragile we are'.
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't be," the dying Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Meer Amshel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, provoked many reactions.
Some argue in favour of Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support Palestinians, arguing that it is a racist Israeli State, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is credited with the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on who, in these recurring waves of killings, is a criminal and who, after all, the victim, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation and did not witness the outbreak of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to see who is primarily served by the 95-year-old tension (based on the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small part of the land of the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is, above all, the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people have always taken their steps on their own, or whether there has been someone behind their throne who has guided their actions towards pre-determined goals.
It should be assumed that we live in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several persons, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have taken place in a single generation.
Among astronomically wealthy families, there is one that could be seen as the head of a sprout (I don't know if anyone's standing above them, but that's not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought already in the 1990s to stop rumours linking their name to criminal actions in the higher spheres in which they were in the shadows, and which always led to strengthening their power, increasing wealth, or both.
They have large shares in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they have no shares, they are waging or preparing a war (only seven countries were at war before the invasion of Afghanistan, five countries after the invasion of Iraq, only four remained after the overthrow of Gaddafi, but at the same time the Russian Government took the central bank of its country into its own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain central bank status for the Rothschild Bank of America, he began producing his own (understanding government) money during the civil war and was killed in 1865 in the theatre.
John F. Kennedy began issuing his own money and wanted to cancel the Fed (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963. Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for unleashing the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for the three world wars created by the 33rd-level great Mason Albert Pike.
The purpose of the first war was to destroy the monarchy states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially the United Kingdom, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (so many slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume many resources), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism can be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and to finally seize absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families operate, led by the Rothschilds, is to challenge the crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the founding of the Fed, which should have prevented the recurrence of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia by launching a Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economic surrender of Germany (no longer necessary to destroy the royal Russia) and, as a result, the Central-European Power, Austria-Hungary, was fragmented.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposing huge military reparations on Germany, rather than creating a precept to radicalization of the impoverished masses, then left only to plant a sufficiently strong German, denouncing the guilty and offering simple solutions to the Chief, to further create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and indeed played the role of a fifth column, in fuelling war fire.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Declaration of Balfour created a precondition for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was initially held by bankers, or what he did was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the prerequisites for recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for the 2nd World War, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed of war for the third.
If international bankers can unleash it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will be the victims of hostilities on the front line, now together with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of people into Israel's supporters and opponents).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless cycle of violence if it began with individual greed and their desire for world power?
There is a need to distinguish ordinary Israeli people from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are pushing people to vote in elections solely for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu Hawk, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international banker who does everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan), will threaten to escalate into a world conflict, and given Iran's control over the Strait of Hormuz, which contains 20 per cent of the world's oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also destroy the world economy.
In what light are the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis, and people will adopt a new world order”.
The new world order in its representation is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born organism is implanted at birth with a chip with which it becomes a creature under total control.
"And makes all small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves have branded on their right hand or forehead, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast, or the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
That is wisdom: everyone who has reason can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.
"Operation Argo": When it's worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist demonstrators captured the United States Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pehlewi, who fled after the US revolution, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, a positive outcome of the situation was not anticipated - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, it was unable to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free hostages by force.
The detainees were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations facilitated by the Algerian Government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, culminating in Ronald Reagan's election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck "Operation Argo" describes one episode of the story that brought small wins to America.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After the difficult perches, they finished their journey to the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to retrieve them from Iran, while aided by an extravagant cover legend that they had travelled through Canadian passports as members of a film crew seeking a location in the country to film a science fiction epope.
Combination of genres
The plan that Tony Mendez's evacuation expert invented required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend credible, specialized magazines wrote about the film's draft, press conferences were held, and a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film, based on Tony Mendes' memoirs.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called movie-kinopus, the story of a successful idea, the scams, is an example of a series of films about Oaken's friends.
The film constantly changes moods - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the credits show landmark historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there is no great difference in this).
On the other hand, lightened Hollywood passages intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then there's scenes from CIA headquarters and other agencies-- men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on the agency stairs, on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to get his career back on track.
From a mocking actor, he became a respected director, and his game ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" his third feature film, after dark detective goodbye, baby, good-bye (2007) and City thriller (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film by Affleck not to be filmed in the director's hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place, however, refers to qualities that raised the director's earlier films over the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it at Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film occur on the streets, when real events are reconstructed - the opening scenes of the embassy's fall impress their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unforeseeability that arise when history suddenly changes somewhere.
The same effect of Affleck and his colleagues achieve in scenes of fiction (a fake headquarters on a Tehran bazaar).
Too many trials in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that narrative does not imply many exciting scenes of cinematographic importance.
He's pretty successful with this few, sometimes something makes up - it's not all so elegant (a scene where a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at Tehran airport, and a run on the runway looks pretty elaborate).
Argo's disadvantage is dispersal due to the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are indeed very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of drama, a film that can be watched with moderate interest, evaluating the production and retro style that recreates the 1970s thrillers.
But it's barely exciting.
However, this is enough to remind us of one, still in a certain sense of living history, as well as to demonstrate how exaggerated the perception of almighty and all-knowing intelligence agencies is.
Inflating of balloons, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com portal, which conducts an annual poll on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop".
"We have been inspired by this latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major European companies," said Prada questionnaire organizer Patrick Nager.
Among the absurdities already nominated is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of premiums for men and women.
So far, women have had benefits for life insurance because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by people for the competition before the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place before the end of February 2013, said Nager.
The controversial EU regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of bio-components to fuel, resulting in damage to nature, and the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury degrees only because they contain a relatively small amount of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of a cage for chickens, which has resulted in significant egg prices this year.
The actual ban on the use of the term “bourbread oil” or the removal of classic light bulbs from the sale were also criticized.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European machinery often makes a decision under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by a State or a group of States (the Czech Republic is now even at risk of defending the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are such that, for example, the top-quality bananas in the European Union should have reached a length of 14 centimetres and did not dare to display "anomalous curvature".
In doing so, the European Commission justified the fact that it only harmonizes existing fragmented national rules that made trade more difficult.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, has nevertheless relaxed the standards for fruit and vegetables, citing that existing directives will lead to waste of products.
Last year's EU regulation that selling balloons must be given a warning that children under the age of eight cannot inflate them without adult supervision may also be a candidate for the poll.
The EU has turned to American studies, according to which balloons in the game are a potential cause of death of children by suffocation.
This restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age, who are not allowed to blow in marquee duds.
Funny ideas are born at home, too.
The rule concerning European officials themselves was absurd: anyone who held an official position in the EU could not, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, but should instead say “BürM” (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com portal, in cooperation with the Liberal Economists' Association “The Principle of Non-intervention” (Laissez Faire), proposed for voting, in addition to several absurd rules mentioned above, such as the EU regulation on the amount of food stocks on the territory of a Member State.
The EU has established a maximum stock of food that may be in the Czech Republic on the date of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established amounts of canned mushrooms, for which it was liable to a large fine.
The questionnaire was also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea and the idea of granting subsidies for applications for subsidies.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not Brussels.
"We're at a disadvantage because we don't have the sea.
Ask for compensation from the European Union," said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSDP) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that there was a high yield of grain in the country and, as a result of the so-called intervention procurement, the State had full stockpiles of stocks that had to be removed.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to Palas, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grains from landlocked countries.
Grants for the grant were offered to villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Pavel Nemz (US-DEU), in particular such grants were to be drawn up for a grant application from Brussels.
EU: Curious regulations are the exception
While regulations in member States are easily criticized, EU regulatory efforts, as well as better functioning and development of the European Union, are considered by many experts to be more worthy of recognition.
A major problem, in the view of the experts, is the drawing of EU grants for projects that do not even imply a commonality with deepening European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the budget debate.
It causes emotion among the Czechs and that, as in other European Union countries, the Czech Republic should fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians, retained the name "Olomowsky cheeses", the "Tuzem rum", whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, was to be renamed "Tuzemak".
Only products from cane distillate, not sugar beet, can be called rum.
The official list of EU-registered products, along with the world-famous "feta" and "gorgonzola" cheeses, marzipan of German Lubek or Parm ham, has already been found, for example, to be carlovarian suhari, pottery and thrashbon carp, and zhuetzek hmel.
The EU’s trademark can also be proud of the Pardubic carrot and the Gorzy tubers.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to run for president?
I don't think about becoming a senator or president myself.
If everything was working in the country without a problem, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can't stand to see the country embezzling over the past 20 years, thieves poking around, people raising taxes and retirement ages.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I am now forty years old and an independent person who is not a member of any party, I have no other way to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I always said I'd fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I were elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not the post, the post is the tool by which I can exercise my views.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the greatest authority.
But the difficulty is not only that as a nation, we snort in our own bar or television, but are ready to trample on anyone who tries to make a difference.
To this is added the media, which defame a person, and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For example, I was told that I was giving bribes to journalists, or that I was an advisor to Jiri Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
The fight for the presidential castle you started with theories about the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and back-to-back property declarations worth more than 20 million.
To do so, it is necessary to change the law.
You don't have that power as president, and only a whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to do that?
When I lobbied as a citizen for the guided tour to become a free enterprise, it was able to move forward.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or right, they are deliberately obstructed, and that discourages citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan, I have a much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it without looking back on the dogmats.
Do you think you're more of a right-wing or left-handed person?
From a Czech point of view, I think I'm more of a left-wing person.
It doesn't matter to me, a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we go forward.
It's not about someone who's right, but someone who's left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for society whether it is proposed by the HRCM or the HDP, and I will also oppose the bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already functioning in the world, or they're being spoken of by eminent experts.
But without parliamentary support, you'll only have slogans.
And with that, you won't last long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to enforce criminal and material liability?
I don't have another chance.
Only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to their side so that we can achieve ours.
If I had been elected President, it would not have been a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would call on the presidents of parliamentary parties to legitimize material and criminal responsibility for politicians, public servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they'll have to tell you why they don't want to.
If there is a strong individual who would speak of abuse, it would be possible to exert pressure on the political scene.
Take the president's direct election - it was a tribute to public pressure.
I'm telling you directly that I'm an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I'm just a political starter, and for my program, I'm gonna try to get the majority's support.
I'm trying to move things on my own; if that fails, I'll be done in six years and I'll be back in the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura's supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not doing anything alone, so I've bypassed a number of famous people with an offer to run for Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchure, he refused because of the volume of work.
I also at least supported the ongoing investigation of journalist Jan Lorenzov, who discovered fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really unhappy, but now I feel like I'm on the scales.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the election, and most of those who went to the establishment.
There's only two of us independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate in such a way that changes will be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, such as direct election of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking about the basis of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to test the purity of every potential supporter's past, and I don't have any money for it.
There's no money for the presidential campaign, only 20,000 kroner in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and what's your own business with that?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, a ten million apartment, another eight million apartment, a collection of artworks of about 10 million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and Schcode Superb for a million, and a few more million in the account.
By the way, I had Aston-Martin because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove, was gallant with women, and at the same time fought against scoundrel and lawlessness.
You drive Aston Martin, own $60 million in property, and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Am I supposed to be in debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors suggests that my program is not as interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my pocket.
The campaign costs are basically going to cover Senator's salary.
But with that money, I wouldn't live, for example, to pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
So you're going to be doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut down on this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the salary.
As I promised, I have reduced my activities in part.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency will be my deputy in the spring.
People would have wanted me to be a silver-free man who would have kept the Republic.
But I have to live on something, too.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting monthly?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which is what I'm getting.
And if I were president, I'd finish my business.
You will find a full interview in the Saturday's issue of The Law.
The MVRDV architects prove that real adventures are not just in the imagination - on the example of Speykenisse and his newly built Book Mountain - 2 photographs
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, passing on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist in a nearby large enterprise, thinks, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad, and e-books.
No one's going to such old-fashioned libraries now, right?
Speykenisse, a minor bedroom under Rotterdam, has an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate situation, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro notes, in the form of painted miniatures made of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative has been modest.
And that's when the town's fathers realized they had the only chance to beat the statistics: build a library here!
Wine Maas of the Rotterdam architectural bureau of MVRDV, the master of bold column diagrams and author of witty, sometimes even cynical, structures, treated the task with his usual undisturbedness and appeared in a contest audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and a grin on his face.
And while the members of the jury were puzzled to look around and shrug their shoulders, the daring Maas folded out of his original gift a pyramid in size and concluded the speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Respect citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal: "The Book Mountain" in Speykenisse, the so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, supermarket, postage and several adjacent housing units and townships for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second award of the 2012 Best Library of the Netherlands.
The project also participates in the 2012 National Dutch Woodwork Competition.
Thus, a faceless suburb that had previously been able to offer nothing but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly town hall whose white facades suggest a milk plant has become richer on one modern piece of architecture.
But most importantly, Speykenisse has the first cultural public building in the history of this town.
A Long Way to the Book
First impression: Eldorado's book under a cheese cap.
There's only one elevator in the middle of the mountain range, because real fans of architecture and reading would prefer to explore this area on foot.
Exposed from all sides - light and easy to see, floors of burnt brick and elegant street lights unmistakably create a sense of public urban square.
The urban environment is re-established perfectly.
The look is unwittingly looking for benches, dogs, and football-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Odinary bookshelves stand along facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless," says Winy Maas.
We put the classical configuration of the space on its head and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The internal space of the bookmount is used skillfully: the centre houses offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities.
The black bookshelves, which serve as the finer walls, the parapets, and the staircases, are particularly pleased.
Their species, texture, and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and builders are lost in guesses as to what this unknown material is.
"We sought to work with secondary materials," explains Yop Trauborst, the project manager representing the Speykenisse community, as required by the standard.
And one day at a farm in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years now, artificial fibre material of millimetre thickness has been used as a root lining in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and saves time.
Tiny textiles serve one or two seasons, and can then be discarded.
For the library, this painting, for the first time in this volume, was compressed in a panel four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplastic (KLP) turns into dark, homogeneous, durable material, which smells a little like a new car and a little sneaker.
The top is led by 105 steps.
Whoever crosses the road nearly 500 metres long will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and tree ficus in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Cost of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is a model environmental project," Trouborst says.
The heat of the ground shall be used to heat and cool it.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass cap, even in clear days the sun enters only briefly.
Large farms of glued wood, perpendicular to the glass facade, give shade and take over most of the sunlight.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The remaining protection is provided by fully automatic roll curtains.
Stefan Spermon, a skeptic from the IT field mentioned above, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was here as well.
Also, traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of Speykenisse, who was long missed."
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate a book from his own congregation.
These books were to take up empty seats on the shelves of the yet-to-full library - at that time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The regiments are forced to the top.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Vini Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident is now connected in some way to this new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it only serves for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV was able to accomplish the royal task, which on professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Speykenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for building an identity.
Sabo: "Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on recognition of Palestine.
Stephen Sabo, an expert on US-Europe relations, believes that Berlin, by doing so, balances on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first indicated that it would vote against the Palestinian application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 uprising in Libya, Germany also abstained in the vote to establish a no-fly zone.
NATO eventually carried out this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The point is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, from a policy that the US has so-called ruled to a German foreign policy itself.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent unified policy.
Thus, the Germans find themselves again between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just trying to find their role, but they're on the road to "more normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy as France or the United Kingdom pursues.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
This is a willingness to take a position in its national interest that is not dependent on the position of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. on exports and links to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests were largely different from those of other major States, and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East conflict and the United Nations vote?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It must therefore be careful not to insult the public and elites in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its part.
But I wouldn't put too much emphasis on it, it's not a totally one-sided connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the German calculations.
Did Germany harm its relationship with the United States by abstaining from making important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I am sure that in Europe, and even in the United States, understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
Indeed, it signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be considered.
There are different views about the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the US has clearly expressed its preference for the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European states?
Because of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama government has a deep-rooted understanding of the European position.
But, of course, due to the local political situation, the Government cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that substantial differences of opinion are not as significant as they always seem.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, notice that Obama is not at all excited about Netanyahu's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of a crucial partner in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for Germans if there was a single, consistent European policy, but it is not now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and have to act instead on their own vision.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it really take the lead?
Or is Germany still hard to lead?
Germany is not yet accustomed to this, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is always difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis — every time Germany takes on an important role, a variety of anti-German feelings are manifested.
It's not easy for Germans to deal with.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much worse position than the US.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and opinions, which is not easy.
So, U.S. influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but the EU is not filling this vacuum right now, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a larger role.
Even if you don't like it, dislike it, or increase dislike for you, that's life.

"Puma and Armani trademark security" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
It is a completely officially registered name in China that has nothing to do with the firms from whose names it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file a lawsuit.
But then it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloh, a Taylor Wessing lawyer specializing in trademark rights violations in the Far East.
My desk shows up every week on a new case of this kind.
Simulators only need to add a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci it's Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German enterprises, such as the producer of Puma sports goods, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with the records of the Trademark Registration Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also uses the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions of copying and intellectual property rights violations is well known.
In large cities, there are multi-story department stores selling almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloh's cases were not the same; on behalf of his trustees, he opposed that Chinese enterprises should be officially authorized by the trademark registry to use a name that was already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "ban minpei," the marca passenger.
This word is associated with "ban dakuan".
That's what women who prey on rich men are called.
Chinese authorities do not plead guilty
"It damages business, it needs to be combated," Pattloch is convinced.
"Commerce brand washed, unique position lost, image badly damaged".
Financial losses and procedural costs in affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copyable products.
According to the CLSA Market Research Company, China, with a sales volume of Euro15 billion per year, is the third largest and fastest growing luxury market.
However, it is difficult and costly to remove questionable entries from the register of trademarks.
The trial may last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases in which the court dismissed the claims because after a long period of time the contested name became "a reality of the market".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarizer because he damaged his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a litigation with the construction vehicle manufacturer Sany, a company that had recently acquired a concrete pump manufacturer, Putzmeister.
Therefore, Chinese still have the right to use a emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo company Geely originally used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Lacoste's fashion producer lost in China to simulators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had a famous crocodile looking the other way.
The Chinese authorities don't think they're guilty.
The Trademark Registration Office of CMMO in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to lack of staff and facilities.
But last year, there was a "return from emergency in the work process to normal."
Thus, the number of pending cases on objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending in the agency.
It's expensive to fight.
As very often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CMMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China has led the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive time, reports the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan fees were paid.
If simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth many times more to challenge, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has fought against the Chinese plagiarizer.
The Germans managed to ensure that their illegal production of counterfeit car parts was eliminated.
However, the simulator reserved Chinese trademark rights to Freudenberg.
This was a failure of its own, as surnames in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Ventzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO Trademark Registration Authority rejected the Munich claim.
True, in both of the following instances, Freudenberg won, but the opposing side still continues to fight.
Need to be on guard.
The matter is currently pending before the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes up a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs are hardly measurable, and the firm's archives have had to review even 100 years ago in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a “greater six-digit amount in euros” for a settlement.
"It's clear from here how expensive it is for us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
That is, if simulators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather products.
The concert had long ceased production in those areas, but had nevertheless been able to prevent registration.
"We need to be on guard," says Wentzler.
Both he and Pattloch counsel recommend German businesses to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark protection provisions, rather, foreigners should “all that are worth protecting in any way should be registered also in China”, Ventzler says.
Otherwise, it could cost a lot more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposite party license fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Otherwise, we'll be pushed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: trampling, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, Imbong Choir rehearses - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of the relationship, which crossed a distance of more than 8,733 kilometres.
First, there's drowning: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats, and men's slippers pick up the tackle on the parket floor and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
It is only then that the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly grow - they advance, charm, and follow each other.
And Fithe Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost pops out of his cloth shoes as he guides them with flexible and articulate gestures.
Monday night, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Imbongi's chorus rehearses a new song.
Fifty choir members from 23 to 69, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor, attended the rehearsal.
"Om "Obani" is a difficult thing, every voice of the choir has its own text, and in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help
Unaids estimates that the United Nations AIDS programme has some 34 million people living with HIV in the world.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitzheni, a coalition of Voices for Africa found chiefs in Germany.
Of these, 70 attend a school that prepares for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot meal in Gogo Center.
Imbong in Zulu means a storyteller or a praiser.
This room doesn't speak fluently to a banta, but they can sing.
For almost a decade the choir has learned songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally even brings them back to where they first appeared: southern Africa.
After all, 8,733 kilometres of summer from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitzheni, which depends on the votes of the German choir.
Forty per cent infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, and many children in the population.
More than 300 of them were without parents who died of the HDI virus.
In Esitzheni, the miniature reflects the disease of Swaziland as a whole: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of men's foreskin, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost non-existent among the population.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland ' s population is immunized with the virus, and death in the middle of the fourth dozen is not uncommon.
Choir opened the village on a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, but previously Imbogni participants saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but also everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment by individual participants - a few euros a year to send the child to school and allow him to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded Voices for Africa, which has since been almost professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Esitzheni.
Sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs are classified as syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (honoreus).
HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are frequent viral STIs.
The pubic pediculosis and scabies are among parasitic STIs.
What are the main target groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are found mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that in at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adults with frequent sexually transmitted diseases have chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, canidosis (griboke), gonorrhea, and human papilloma virus.
HIV prevalence among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infection is significantly higher than among other population groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Human papilloma virus is also common among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints during urination, excretion, pain at the bottom of the abdomen, and bubbles or seals.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain invisible.
How can you defend yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide 100 per cent protection.
Some sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through contact infection and close physical contact.
The experts therefore recommend a regular survey, especially when sexual partners change frequently.
An early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid remote effects.
The honors, donations, and not least the fees for choir performances across Germany allow for some gathering.
"We've sent it all to Esitzheni for about 200,000 euros," says Anne Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is managed by Zdwa Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also ensures that orphans are well arranged, such as one of her grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call Zulu old women, is a pillar of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them shelter over their heads, and ensure that children in uniform appear on time for classes every day.
Those who have no relatives go to the shelter to Hanysil, a single woman receiving salaries from the association, as do the two cooks who cook each day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two hens and, together with the United States health organization PSI, organized HIV testing for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, prefers to remain deeply silent.
The King With 14 Wifes
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," Annette Lennartz says, "because it's related to sexuality."
Quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, this state-sanctioned lifestyle is also responsible for the rapid spread of the HDI virus in past years.
But it also lies on vagrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
There are free condoms on every corner, says Annet Lennartz, "but they're hardly used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh."
In order to support a little cultural exchange, Ibmoni's choir travels to southern Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sadness, martial spirit, confidence and black self-awareness, which many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in black - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but has even occasioned tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip also always brings to Esitzheni, where the singers visit the undercarriage children.
Although it is difficult to find a small village on a map, it is more than known in the Etzulweni River Valley.
"Go to Esitzheni, there's light," said the people here.
And after an 8733 km flight back to Heidelberg, when the stomping singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is on fire here as well.
Messenger: NASA opens ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there's ice on the planet Mercury.
Ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick.
NASA's U.S. Space Agency has proven the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, as can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger Zone has found evidence that the planet's permanent shadow region is covered with ice.
It should be at least 30 centimeters thick, possibly up to 20 meters thick.
Presumably, water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid that encountered Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said probe science director Sean Solomon.
Mercury's temperature can be as high as 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life have reached other parts of the solar system.
Unobservable to Earth's inhabitants are probes, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small windows into endless daisies.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who turns around the Sun to Neptune, Cerera, by a new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union, is not a planet.

Depending on the color transmission, images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory, the picture shows the trifid nebula of several thousand light-years away in the constellation of the Arrow.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-dole, three-separated), as the dark dust bands are divided into three parts of the hot heart of the cradle of stars.
In the constellation of the Serpent, astronomers photographed a precursor to a space collision: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the cores of the two merging galaxies are being carried to one another and will inevitably collide.
This is the birth of the star Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Someone who doesn't like technical abbreviations can call it "South Centural Wheel."

It is a star cloud connected to the Rosette Nebula, also constantly creating new stars - 5,000 light years away from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a little black hole, there's no dust yet, just gas.
Researchers suggest that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our Views on the Universe: Critical Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgei, even before Galileo Galileo later started observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become ever more - and the space available to their eyes is getting deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here was five metres in diameter.
Arizona, U.S.A., has a Big Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescope Canarias has a giant internal device - the diameter of the mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The Greater South African Telescope Mirror in South Africa is segmented to reduce cost.
However, it reaches about 11 metres in diameter.
The lack of low-cost design performance: the telescope is rigidly attached at a vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature is high light-assembly ability.
It achieves, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With a radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope is 305 metres in diameter.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Mind (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing his computing power.
A view of the Observatory of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There's a "Very Large Telescope" here, which is completely consistent with its name.
Its four mirrors allow the visual tube to illuminate even the medium infrared spectrum.
The installation of the European “Very Large Telescope” is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should be spread as far as 42 meters - and would be composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photographs should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors 10 metres in diameter.
The Keck televisionscopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into the sky with the help of the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope, with a 30-metre-diameter mirror, should appear on Mauna Kea.
You can look at them here in illustrations.
However, the most important species from space are supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has been supplying paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, Kepler's space telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, primarily those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 planets had been identified since the start of the mission.
The photo shows the latest preparations for the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be sent into space until 2018 on board the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to find the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this as the Messenger revolves closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades indicated that Mercury had ice on it.
Thanks to the 2004 Messenger probe, the first one to revolve around Mercury, scientists are now confident.

Finding a solution in a country where 97-year-olds still seem relatively young.
Traveling through the Trash Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
A loud-blowing minibus rolls along a winding road past dense forests of hills, tumultuous rivers, and simple peasant homes.
Everything is so green and bright, you'd think you were in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost edge of Azerbaijan, and the Iranian border is just a few kilometres away.
The Talysh people live here, one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they speak Farsi and Azeri perfectly and are long - lived.
The end point is Leric.
The small town boasts of too heavy a Soviet-time architecture that does not harmonize at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too exhausting.
It takes 8 hours to reach 323 kilometres, as the road has only one lane.
The legedar wealth to which the country owes the Caspian Sea oil is here, to the province, until it gets here.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that there is something to interest tourists in Leric.
"In May Baku was famous for the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people of the world," Fatulayev says.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is a biography of about eight dozen talyxes from these places, over 100 years old, which indicates a black and white photograph.
It's my grandfather, he's 120 years old here.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the museum's controversial star is the Chaban of Shirali Muslumov, who reportedly turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given that the oldest person whose age is documented is 122 years old, Muslumov's age is extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaev.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and he allegedly had a daughter at the age of 136.
So did the Chuba of Muslum add a few decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholtz, an age researcher from Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of long-term residents in Central Asia.
"A striking number of older people can also be found in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholtz says, "Sardinia also has an extremely large number of very old people."
However, due to the lack of documentation, scientific proof of age is not possible, as there were no civil registers.
Every day a glass of hot oil
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the Leric area are surprisingly likely to reach Bible age.
There are now 20 people over the age of 100.
Why are so many long-term residents here in the south?
Azerbaijan's guide Farid Mugimzade explains this with special Talish genes.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the contrary, believes it's about nutrition.
Tashes love meat, bread, and milk products the most, many of them drink a glass of fueled oil every day; however, such a high-calorie diet can hardly be nutritionally healthy.
Or is it about the primordial lifestyle that keeps people young?
At 97, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasian region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil that rides back and forth.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva's sons and daughter, who have long had their grandchildren.
There's also two kids in the neighborhood.
In the kitchen, guests are made tea, which is served in typical tummy glasses of Armoud.
Mirzaeva has perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, under her headscarf she hides the long dark-red braids her son proudly reveals to us.
I'm always my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept color.
"And I've never used shampoo," says Mirzaev.
A monthly pension is enough for a living.
She always only ate what grew in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought food in a store in my whole life.
She then tells of her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest part was after World War II.
But it got better when the "lovable father" Geydar Aliyev stood at the helm.
Propaganda doesn't often sound in an old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as dictator, in Azerbaijan knows almost no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then his son, Ilham, took over the reins of government.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azeri elderly.
230 manats (approximately equal to the same amount of euros) Mirzaeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions it is the amount for which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzaeva's long-bred son is also right: "Stary women in our culture are deeply respected."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happiness.
Than there's no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word “human rights” does not appear in the Constitution.
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo are evidence of the deep divisions of the country.
A future Constitution based on sharia has met with a fierce opposition.
The Egyptian president didn't give up on the paphos.
We must create a transition.
"And his success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, but above all to Christian Cops, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
Because all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said that he temporarily reduced the competence of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competence "to save the revolution."
However, what really wants to save a 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate from the American University of Southern California is not fully clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Would the judiciary be deprived of its power?
In fact, 234 articles were dragged in a 15-hour night jump with obstacles at an Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a matter of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the judicial process is based on “the principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
This has been and continues to be a matter of interpretation, and Islamists may be feared to use vague language and the resulting legal play to better interpret the sharia.
At least one new article insinuates this: in all cases relating to the sharia, Al-Achar University, the country ' s most important Islamist institution, should be involved in the council, with great authority in all Sunni Islam.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy supervise the law, which would have a de facto effect on the limitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution has been interpreted
Another problem is that the jurisdiction of civilians should remain with the military court.
These courts, during Mubarak's period of power, served to suppress the opposition.
Since the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians have been held in military custody.
Similarly, as the draft states, the State must protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “support its morality and values”.
Legally, this is so vague that public institutions can use this article to control even the content of film and literature.
In open text, this means nothing but censorship.
No article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
The other, however, forbids insulting and defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording that “insulting people” is prohibited also seems questionable.
Is there enough cartoons for the president or a joke about a lawyer?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this draft, which Morsi proposes for signature and which he says will be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum “very soon”.
"The Revolution Is Back"
The opposition against the superiority of Islamists has been emerging for several weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual consensus on Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who was third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, stated that the draft constitution had a place "in the landfill of history."
Through the short news service, he accused Morsi's followers of wanting to lead a "putch against democracy".
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw it away," said oppositionman Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, our brothers' blood has not yet been avenged," quoted Egyptian media as saying Khaled Ali's opposition policy.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would render it null and void.
"The Koran is Our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for a opposite demonstration, but, as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
A large number of women under the veils and Salafi adherents participated, shouting, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded Morsi to clean the country, and they said, "This is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic square on which it all began sparked a state of almost civil war.
Morsi's followers obviously didn't want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brothers stated that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
Most for the Islamist project, this is considered a done thing.
"The concept of "human rights" is never mentioned."
Hafiz Abu Sayed is furious with this forward constitutional process, which was actually supposed to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the President of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EDP) defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or tried under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their world view, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
For this, he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never meet in the new constitution, he regrets talking to "Welt am Sonntag."
Morsi's increased influence on all three branches of government in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures are clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening a civilian state, the president de facto cancelled it," saddens Sayed.
Without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even an international community that looks at the ideological struggle of directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There can be a reckoning for that.
A demonstration in Tahrir Square warns, "You're creating a monster you can't control."
Norwegian Rafist: The worst smelling fish in the world?
Norway's five million people have one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but worldwide.
Perhaps the mystery of this country's success has something to do with the local addiction to one extremely stinking fish dish?
Take a few over-ripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're gonna have a bad smell of rusfisco, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacy.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours away from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but there's an invincible distinctive smell in the air.
Rafiscusk is a trout sprinkled with salt and wandered in the water until a year, depending on what kind of bird to get.
As twilight gathers and colds, Norwegian crowds gather for a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this, let's say, exciting dish.
"She eats raw and drinks a drink of aquavit, a local tminal vodka," explains Howard Halvarsen, a local fireman by profession and part-time "rofiscal general" who runs the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat fish cut in small cubes and drink a lot of alcohol.
"Someone likes aquavit more than a rusfisk," Howard says.
This drink is capable of breaking the smell.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not that bad, it's not much different from the sushi you've been carrying around on the bus for a long time.
Rafiscus is a Norwegian product from a very different time, a time of poverty, when, before the advent of the refrigerators, fish were soaked in hermetically sealed barrels of salt water in the fall.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish were already well and thoroughly lost, it was extracted and, when the perception of alcohol was muted, consumed.
Back in the past generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to flee their country in search of work and emigrate mainly to the United States.
The population is growing rapidly, with more than 13 per cent of the population being immigrants, who are involved in jobs, high wages and an advanced social security system.
The people of Sweden (a longtime rival and not so long ago and a much more wealthy neighbour) come to work here on a massive scale.
Rafisk is perceived as an important symbol, an essential, though somewhat odious, element of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, it's all expensive, a little beer or a sandwich cost you £9 (US$14).
Norway rarely appears on the world news, and most people in the country seem to be comfortable with that.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Brawick, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the terrorist attack is called "the July 22 incident."
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and assassinations.
Norway's present well-being is based on the growth (since the 1970s) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"On the other hand, oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, who delivers trays with rusfi, a woman with long blonde hair and amazingly blue eyes, the embodiment of nordic well-being.
We are a nation of understanding, as you call it.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks great English.
We don't like to show up, we don't brag.
Norway is very careful about its oil - most of the oil and gas revenues are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was wasting money they didn't have, Norway was careful in calculating all the costs.
"As long as you can ski in the winter and go camping in the summer, that's enough to be happy," Anna says.
"And there's a rusfisk," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food, and I've had enough of the shell.
Here's a hamburger with salmon meat - it's definitely exotic, it's delicious juicy meat.
But there's still more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell waiting for us tonight.
There's a special dinner at my hotel about the rusfisk, during which the best or perhaps the most aroma fish is determined by the vote of the visitors.
There's a straight-line teleether showing a host in a bow tie surrounded by plates with a racfi.
It's like a Eurovision song contest.
"So, Thor-Yergen, what's the best fish you've ever scored in the mountains?"
"Yeah, Howard, here's our score."
Everybody laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off a chair, possibly by changing the aquavita.
Or maybe just foreboding the smell of that fish.
The President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, has a difficult start in his career.
As Mexico's newly elected President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
The traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly poor state.
This city is overburdened by transport and at a better time, and steel barriers have been erected since Monday, cutting several key highways to the capital and causing road chaos.
However, this was not done to prevent people from going to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from reaching the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will wear a presidential ligament and take the reins of the country's rule.
He has a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico had achieved good economic performance under the Felipe Calderón administration, which was now defusing its powers, but the country had become mired in the war on drugs, which had already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government announces to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence," Mr. Peña Nieto told US President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Peña Nieto's political career with the President of the United States developed as Governor of his native state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and vast state surrounding the country's capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
A straight-line person
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, he is remembered with warmth.
Residents have credited him with the revitalization of tourism, the development of resorts and the construction of infrastructure.
The city can be reached on one of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which are strikingly different from the bollocks and pits that were previously at the site.
Tables with his name hang on the modern building of the sports centre and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We have hopes for real and serious change with him," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a state congressman from Peña Nieto's institutional-revolutionary party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, particularly in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous rule, the PRI party was displaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he refutes the allegations of lack of substance that the opposition put forward to the new President.
He is very direct and very committed to the realization of his vision for the future of the country.
It's an excellent statesman, and above all, a man who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of a former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast with the powerful streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under motorway relays, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in this mega-polis.
Earlier this year, troops had been used to curb drug gangs in those areas; violence against women was particularly acute.
Several dozen bodies of murdered women have been found in the desert near an extensive dump in the last two years alone.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City during the governorship of Mr. Peña Nieto, a figure far higher than that in the notorious city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name became negative when it came to the killing of innocent women.
According to Mr. Peña Nieto's opponents, at best he had been unable to cope with the issue of the killing of women during his tenure as Governor.
At worst, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete house similar to most houses in this dilapidated area, Irinaya Buendia has difficulty in holding back tears by showing me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to Mariana's official version, she committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner killed her.
"When I got to her house, it looked like her body was washed before," recalls Ms. Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten and the body was already hardened.
Mariana's mother recounts this story, and her daughter's portrait looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifix, where only one word is inscribed: justice.
This was said to have been denied to the family.
"State officials treated me like an old gossip who was dissatisfied with the troublemaker.
They want people to just accept what they say and keep their mouths shut.
But it's wrong, that's not right, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around," she says.
When President Peña Nieto wears a presidential ligament on Saturday, he will take on a heavy responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico had been affected by violent crimes, and the new President had promised to make the solution of that problem a priority during his reign.
"I hope he'll be the same president as the governor," says Olver, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, this is what the families of victims in Ciudad Nes fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain of ill-treatment, pleads charges.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations about poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning's stay at the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense demands that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning's conditions of detention were cruel.
The U.S. Private Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, charged with the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, had not taken many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he said he had been able to endure while in a military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Mede, Maryland, the military prosecutor, Major Ashden Fein, stated that records of weekly visits to Manning by the prison administration during the nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
The cross-examination, as part of the defence motion to dismiss Manning, on the grounds that his conditions of detention were cruel and in themselves sufficient punishment, was conducted the day after Manning stated that while in detention he intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is charged with stealing several thousand secret documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet at WikiLeaks.
The WikiLeaks resource did not confirm that Manning was the source of the information.
During the Friday hearing, Prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, reviewed the reports which had been completed after visits to Manning by the administration during his stay at Quantico Prison, where he was under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Fein asked Friday about the reports, Manning admitted that he regarded his treatment by the prison administration as "excellent" and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
The reports examined do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, even though Manning was explicitly asked about the conditions of his detention, Fane claims.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concerns about these issues and that the authorities who visited him had discussed these issues with him and stated that they would be dealt with but had not been recorded in writing.
"They recorded "no problems" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean I didn't bring it up in the conversation," Manning says.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his ill-treatment in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission considering the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing several months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted him to be removed from the "damage warning" regime and to ease the conditions of detention.
The military authorities explained that the limited detention regime, which was lower than the suicide control regime, had been introduced to protect the prisoner as well as the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm okay with them to cancel the injury prevention regime... so that my life would improve, from my point of view," Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had suicide thoughts in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness due to severe heat.
He explained that psychologically it is very difficult when you are not given to know how your fate is decided, and what happens in the outside world.
"My world has come down to Camp-Arifjan base, before the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I was gonna die in that cage."
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - all alone.
Manning reports that he was only allowed to leave his mattress, blanket, spankers, some clothes and glasses.
He says that he tried to move because he was sleeping or even simply being banned from the rules during the day.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly hit in the eye with light coming in from outside the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he was turning around in bed at night, he said he was woken up and forced to turn on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed an official objection to Manning's ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
Furthermore, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about a statement he had made during his testimony on Thursday that after one night he had been forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he had been forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at the morning check-up.
Manning stated that he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the check.
Responding to the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard's order that he should throw a blanket that could cover himself, but admitted that no one had explicitly ordered him to leave him.
On Thursday, Manning stated that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reported that he told an officer that he could use a pair of panties or spankers to traumatize himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, flippers and glasses were taken from the cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had experienced during his imprisonment and significantly reduce his sentence, should Manning be found guilty by a military court, which was due to start his case early next year.
The defence has stated that it plans to ask Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes and other charges to challenge as excessive.
The resumption of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of detainees under the strictest possible regime.
The charges brought against Manning include aiding and abetting the enemy, illegally facilitating the release of data on the Internet, transmitting information related to national defence, and stealing State property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he may be liable to life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is a Mexican-American story.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to a lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes Mexicans of American descent are torn between two cultures.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down a corridor for incoming arrivals, approached the border control area and frozen on the spot.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexiconos (Mexicans), the other for Extranjeros (foreigns).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called Mexican my whole life.
It's just a conditional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York think they're Italian.
Later, I stopped at the complex design of "American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's home, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of the speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and lined up for Extranjeros.
I recalled that story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The issues of immigration, drugs and trade, which are familiar to the Presidents of these countries, were on the agenda.
President Peña Nieto was pleased to talk about the recovery of the Mexican economy, which would enable Mexicans to remain in Mexico with the same success instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the US and Canada and create some North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a hard and long-suffering issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory at gunpoint.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
So when only a US statesman utters a word of criticism toward Mexico, the press and the elites of Mexican society are immediately complaining that Americans are trespassing on the sovereignty of neighbours.
And Montesuma's descendants are filled with militancy.
However, Mexico's most difficult relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States is.
Do you want to talk about the offenses?
There's enough of them.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities in this country, and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican origin are only for one reason: at some point in their family history, anyone - father or grandfather - was unable to realize himself in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most of the time, they were Mexicans of a certain type - brown, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We're their descendants, and we remember that.
That's not how Mexico sees it.
Today, our lives are the embodiment of the American dream, we have been in good schools and we have found good jobs, but we will not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider as its own.
United States of America.
Moreover, we know that most members of the Mexican elite and ruling class do not like us.
We say the same thing to them.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, like fake Mexicans.
We do not speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind a silk curtain now, finding a full life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and it reminds me that there is a certain friction between the real Mexicans and Mexican-born Americans - Mexicans are more aware of their national identity, and Mexican-born Americans are offended.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes she belongs to both these countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances of Mexican descent do not feel that they belong to any of them.
We're listening to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of the two worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico, we're Americans.
And in the United States, they call us Mexicans.
Now, as I learned during my trip, as if our relationship was not yet complicated enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent her interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It's not gonna work.
Too many offenses in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us don't think this country is so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican-born Americans are still offended by how they treated their relatives in Mexico just recently.
Yeah.
I think we have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
A ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas faction could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East possible?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
There is a common, senseless debate over who started the first; many buildings have been turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; for the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip fell in the vicinity of the Israeli capital, Tel Aviv, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, while Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly stuck in their eternal conflict, changes have taken place in the Middle East.
This may be viewed in different ways, but the events of the Arab Spring have surrounded many established realities in the rebel storm, and the Palestinians with the Israelis have not been able to stay away from the whirlwind that shocked the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
There are, however, reasons for hope that this deadly impasse will be overcome.
War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on 21 November, is implemented, the clashes this week have only strengthened the positions of the silos on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas Islamist movement that took power in the Gaza Strip in 2007 will claim that they forced Israel to retreat despite the losses it suffered.
Although some faction leaders were destroyed and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new powerful and wealthy friends.
The reborn regional leader of Turkey, once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, has supported Hamas; its example has been followed by Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic States in the Persian Gulf.
The solemn supporters of Hamas claim the establishment of an Islamist crescent around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, ruled by a paramilitary group of Hezbollah, to Syria, in which increasingly Islamic rebels are about to overthrow the power of Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the King's authority is threatened by Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred on Israel's southern borders, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement was strengthened under President Mohammed Mursi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who paid no particular attention to supporting Hamas.
On the contrary, Muslim brothers are an organization much similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas can become a significant player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the hardline line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In the military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli Iron Dome missile system has met the cost of its establishment and successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas.
The citizens of Israel can sleep calmly, at least for a while.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the US has remained steadfast; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last round of violence.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, particularly under the Binyamin Netanyahu Government, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although approximately 30 Israelis have been killed since 2004 by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombings, partly through a wall that enters the West Bank, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the 22 January elections - has joined forces with even more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of pandering to the Palestinians and giving them their own State?
If all the power in the West Bank were to be given to them, would they not launch rockets from there towards Israel, as did their fellow Gazans?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and stifling any attempts to lift their heads.
Supporters of the hardline line may win; however, their calculations may be denied in the Arab spring.
While Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere, do not have the most warm feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defensive part of Israel's budget is greater than that of all its Arab neighbours combined.
The outbreak of war with a regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Mursi, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel, to no lesser extent, must take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic changes take place in Arab countries, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is a time bomb that will sooner or later explode in Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression was already undermining the foundations of a democratic order in a Jewish State, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbated those problems.
The bloody operations that take place every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to be paid for by the growing dissatisfaction of the international community.
Both sides need external momentum
There remains the only solution to which sanctimonious representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper, are relentlessly calling: the formation of two States and Israeli concessions of territories in exchange for security.
It remains to be hoped, not too impressive in the short term, that a ceasefire will enable other countries to influence the parties to the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which has long had to take the decision to cut off arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, have the most advantageous position ever to persuade Hamas to accept the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967 in the light of the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries must also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
That would do more to create a Palestinian State than the forthcoming United Nations vote, which could result in recognition of Palestinian virtual statehood.
President Obama also has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he continues to demonstrate reluctance to engage in the issue.
This is a disastrously short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the Uniform Packaging Act for Cigarettes has entered into force.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and images of diseased parts of the body are contrasted with sad green boxes similar to all brands of cigarettes.
The first in world practice Australian law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and coloured presentation of different stamps with the same box of sad olives with creepy images of disease-affected parts of the body and images of children whose health was undermined by smoking by their parents.
In addition to the different pictures and inscriptions warning the harm of smoking, the only difference between the packs mandatory from this Saturday is the names of stamps, which are printed in the same small typeface.
These are the harshest conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The Australian Federal Government states that the aim of this measure is to prevent young people from smoking by depriving them of this harmful habit of fashion status.
This decision was based on research that showed that people who had not started smoking before the age of 26 never smoked in 99 cases out of 100.
"It is clear that even at the youngest age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies try to communicate through packaging," explains Health Minister Tanya Plybersek, citing studies that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess in children.
Australia was one of the lowest smokers in the world, so that changes would not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries were already considering doing so.
The tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of the law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
"This law will have serious consequences other than those conceived by its initiators," says Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
The producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply many more of these items for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the other hand, new laws promote business growth.
Sandra Ha of the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that the demand for cigarette and silicone cases covering unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (practically from zero) since companies such as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case to a high court in Australia two months ago, where they tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about 6,000 items to wholesalers and is waiting for a new shipment.
It's a good business for us.
In the view of experts, the popularity of social networks among the target population is a potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures.
Following the adoption of a number of laws in Australia that have made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support for sporting events, as well as prohibiting vendors from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government has prohibited local companies and websites from placing advertisements online, but it cannot limit overseas websites.
"If you're selling tobacco and you have only this small loophole left, the idea of promoting your product on the Internet will seem very tempting to you," explains Becky Freeman, investigating public health issues at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increasing number of brand reviews written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users on social media such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the work of a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he didn't spare his energy and time and made a video, or is there an advertising company behind it?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry has even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these States are making claims within the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that all these countries have very little trade relations with Australia.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plybersek, the Government was discussing with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory smoking-awareness photos.
The rule is now in place in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstratingly disobeying innovations.
These pictures don't bother me.
I just don't pay attention.
"Just taking a cigarette and hiding a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a photograph of a mouth tumor on a pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can get me to leave is my little daughter.
James Yew, head of the tobacco store King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, claims that the same package made it more difficult to place goods in shelves.
"I've had an hour to unload a new party and now four hours," he complains.
"The government should have taken and banned cigarettes altogether, we would have said, 'What do we do, okay, it's over, we close the store," he says, throwing his hands up.
Boring the world of electronic networks and regular connections is not so bad.
On Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical malfunctions and was replaced by another plane that we were waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to think about the nature of boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and neither books, magazines, iPhones, nor even duty-free shops will help much.
However, more and more scholars and child development professionals have recently expressed their preference for boredom.
They say that in certain situations, it's not so bad for us and our children to miss.
This causes the brain to become distracted by interesting related topics, which may be conducive to creativity.
And since in today's world we're all constantly in front of a screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we should seek boredom.
Yeah.
At the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
I used to think, like many people, that boredom was an invention of the recent times when people had more free time.
This is not the case, claims Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University of Canada, author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history," he says.
The walls in Pompeii contain Latin inscriptions of boredom dating back to the first century.
The question remains, however, as to how we understand boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor, University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying the research on the subject and asking a 100-member target group, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people “want but cannot do what would satisfy them”.
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn't do anything that he would like to do.
I don't want to do anything with apathy.
The main thing in the boredom, he says, is "a breakdown of attention and the resulting deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is running slow."
The description of boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these states, bored people see the causes of the problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression see the problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's just hard to focus on something.
In his study "The Unoccupied Mind: Defining Boring from a Attention Point", published in September's issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to an earlier experiment, where participants listened to a recording of a voice reading the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds of a unrelated television program included in the next room, others heard the same sounds on low volume, so that they could barely be addressed, and a third group listened only to recording the voice without a foreign sound track.
Those who heard low-volume television said that they were bored, more often others - they found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reason and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "e.g. by looking at the flow of products on the conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It is believed that he continues that when people start rocking on a chair or drawing doodles on a piece of paper, they do so out of boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions just help not to relax physically.
"Studies have shown that children who are not prohibited from twirling and spinning learn better and remember more information than children who are asked to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we're all bored with a delayed flight (as in my case), listening to a monotonic speech, watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people show different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, in order to measure such individual features, researchers developed a special "sorry-like scale".
Questions and assertions such as “Many things I have to do are uniform and monotonous” or “I'm too interested, so I don't have time for anything” are used to measure this scale.
Through such questionnaires, researchers have determined that boys miss more girls, says Stephen Vodovic, a psychology professor at the University of Western Florida, especially when there are a variety of external irritants.
However, in general, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment during which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day with the help of a pager.
He obtained the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored in school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside of school.
However, only 3 percent of parents indicated that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what such data would be about boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “young age is at the height of boredom,” mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let's go back to my original question: is boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extremes it can, as research shows, push people into absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling, or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodovic, who has devoted more than two decades to the study of this problem.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; that's boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this very brain does not always know what is best to do.
If you're bored and you direct that energy to guitar or cooking experiments, you're gonna make yourself feel better.
However, if you watch TV, you'll only get better for a while, and soon it'll be over.
So if your child misses and you give him an iPad, he'll stop missing, but he won't learn to fight boredom on his own or in any other way manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenske.
"And such self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations," he claims.
Your child learns not only to do something on his own, he also learns self-control at all.
I don't think boredom needs to be magnified.
But you don't have to think of her as something bad either.
Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even without a continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it so that we need to be bored more often, while boredom is an extremely unpleasant, indescribable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to get away from constant anxiety and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to the constant overstimulation of sense organs," he says, "and when silence comes, we lose ourselves and we don't know what to do."
As long as the new law on the legalization of cannabis herb in the state of Colorado is not known, it is not clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado will be applied.
Anthony Orosco, a 19-year-old football team player and student of a public college in the south-east of Colorado state, is charged with a criminal offence that will soon be perfectly legal throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and a tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco said that one day in September, he and his friends had been in Lamar and had been driving a prairie near the Kansas border when they had been stopped by police.
After the police officer discovered marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco was subpoenaed for possession of drugs and possession of drug devices - minor offences for which a fine of $100 was due for each of them - and the date of the trial was set.
"We are treated like criminals," Mr. Orosco says.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues for weeks after the state of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the solution of hundreds of minor court cases depends not so much on the law as on the venue.
Charges of petty marijuana-related offences are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped charging people aged 21 and over for possession of small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law enters into force in a couple of weeks.
However, in the more conservative Colorado districts, prosecutors have decided to review existing marijuana cases and continue to be held accountable for possession of the drug.
At the same time, some cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West, are voted to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops from appearing in their places.
"All this is developing so fast that I don't even know what to expect next," says Daniel J. Outs, chief of police in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
Control officials in Washington are also puzzled to scratch their heads.
They will have to establish regulations for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which must be done before 1 December 2013.
They say Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in dealing with marijuana use, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Board for the Regulation of the Production and Marketing of Alcohol Products in Washington.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than make some suggestions and hope that this will work.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can focus on," he says.
The Washington State Bill, named I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and place the state in a state of uncertainty for an entire year when State licensing systems are not yet in place and ownership of marijuana is already legal.
There are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, such as how to strike a balance between the state's "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on selling it 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana trading enterprises in cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs," explained Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly established research group, the "Center for Legalization of marijuana".
On 21 November, the Chief of Police of Oates of Aurora sent an e-mail to his subordinates stating that the city's prosecutor's office would no longer hold persons who were 21 years of age responsible for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police would stop denouncing people for the violations “from now on”.
The Chief of Police of Outs reported that the police would monitor compliance in the city with regulations governing the activities of drug growers for medical purposes and prosecute traffickers and drug distributors.
The Well County Attorney in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After a vote on the bill, he stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to prosecute the possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage users to undergo treatment.
To date, 119 individuals have been charged with possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are also charged with other violations.
“The duty of our institution is to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission”, Mr. Buck said in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as the Rural District of Mesa, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the district, no longer prosecute adults for possession of a small quantity of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Houtzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop charges in the already open marijuana-related cases.
"I think it's our direct duty to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55 per cent of Colorado's voters supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for entertainment in the public and legal systems will not be easy.
And the conflicting reaction of residents across the state exposed the mixed attitude of local authorities to the state marijuana experiment.
"Court prosecutors have a cultural barrier to this issue," explains Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing defendants for marijuana possession, and a local representative of the National Organization for Law Reform on marijuana.
"They've been persecuting people for so long that they can't really accept that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington, the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana like alcohol, are destined to become a country-wide experimental field to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but they are also looking to the federal authorities for instructions, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give in to this issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of traffickers and patients who used marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government has in most cases been willing to trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington, D.C., and 16 other states.
Drug Bureau agents are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they will hardly close their eyes to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are permitted under the new law, Kevin A. Sabeth, a former anti-drug adviser at the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations had approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana shops, which would not have opened before a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month ban on the sale of marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a position to give someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, city councilman.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I survived Oxford for being a conservative.
Persecuting university students for their views did not start today.
For as long as I can remember, I've always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother attended Oxford and described it as the world's best educational institution, a modern analogue of an ancient symposium that lays down the two pillars of civilization: freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, at the history faculty of the University of Oxford's Wooster College in the late eighties, I packed my suitcases and left, which turned into the first real scandal of my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed I dropped out of college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from shrub cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically harassed and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or that I went to private school.
I was poisoned for one reason only, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment, it looked like real barbarity and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyatt, was Margaret Thatcher's famous councillor, and I myself was a conservative supporter.
You're gonna ask me, why would you think about that now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students with center-right views are subject to the same kind of harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of Conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of Conservative students demanded the same protection of their rights as the one accorded to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the college student club of the Corps of Christie College in Cambridge claim that they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made to feel undesired guests" due to their political views.
They wish to add an additional representative to the equal rights committee of the college in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation has only been exacerbated by a recent BBC 2 documentary about politics in the student environment, Wonderland: Young, Smart, and Right, in which conservatives were presented by eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservatives Association of Oxford University, who rides in a Rolls-Royce, wears a silver suit and cane with a silver baldasher.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they make "remote goats" because of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, Vice President of the Conservatives Association of Nottingham University, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that "in the university environment, there is a growing bias towards left-wing views.
People who don't even know us think we're brazen and violent children of rich parents with impunity."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at the historic faculty of the College of the Corps of Christie, in which a request for enhanced protection was made, calls such an atmosphere "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Conservatives Association of Oxford University, says that the student club's attitude towards the holders of center-right views has deteriorated considerably.
"This poses a threat to both the intellectual debate atmosphere and the normal life of the club members," she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just a minority, I was alone.
I got there in September 1986, a shy and shy 18-year-old girl.
Oxford was feverish from hating the Conservative Party.
One year earlier, the university had by vote deprived former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to a decrease in the budget allocation for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the freshman's week, when the students met each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time what was ahead of me.
I didn't know that the teachers not only looked through their fingers at the harassment of conservative students, but also enjoyed participating.
Political issues - the strike of miners, the privatization and the Government's opposition to sanctioning the apartheid government in South Africa - have infiltrated the wooden panels of audiences.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the 18th-century French text into English, and I was not ready for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher now dead Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
I had a hard time getting the text, and I kicked myself.
Harry Pitt was a very gall-like man with a face like a cake.
"Thatcherists don't basically teach French, or do they just lack brains?" he asked.
Other students laughed.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I advise you to take some initial French lessons in your spare time, unless you're too busy turning around in society," Pitt ran.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night in college, I sat alone at lunch; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the English Department, who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservatives Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlyly.
Unfortunately, this is as follows:
Anyone suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most freshman conservatives pretend to be Labour."
Later, in a local pub, I was cowardly trying to hypocrite.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work.
A freshman at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How do conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
- They're punching each other, aren't they?
I felt like I must have felt like homosexuals until the criminal prosecution was lifted in the 1960s.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I only have to meet like-minded people in the middle of the night?
Will I be forced to become a Labour and hide my true beliefs?
The three years ahead of me began to seem like hell full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn't hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for being a foreign policy advisor to Thatcher and one of her matchwriters.
He hardly showed up in college.
He despised him for provinciality, mediocreness, and commitment to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I began to travel to Oxford from a parent's home in London, seeking refuge among relatives and impartial friends in the capital.
I told my dad I hate Oxford and I explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s, any political views were adopted.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said.
- They can't do that, not in the city of sleeping spires...
Even my Communist friends have always behaved flawlessly."
His wet eyes are muzzled.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you quit university."
I was exhausted by my constant journey to London and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also a Conservative, did not stand the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
The following week, during a seminar, when another history teacher called me "enemy of the people" quite seriously, I decided to do the same.
In the shower of shame, I admitted that my parents had brainwashed me and called them "old fools."
It wasn't long.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was meant to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Merdock.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and boarded the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a crybaby and a rag.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should be subjected to such anger and intimidation at an educational institution.
Worse still, it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen Tori prime ministers, but still remains hidden today behind the undeserved reputation of the university, which values equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegant fame"
About the Valentine: Sew Master exhibition, which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Barnemica and other prominent Italian designer clients
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting the Valentino Garavani Exhibition.
The designer acknowledged this at the opening of Valentine's: Master of Sewing, a triumphal retrospective exhibition that combines over 130 high fashion dresses created by his "home" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says, with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of a story whose only character is "il señor" Garavani, but it could not be written without his prominent clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobles.
In the first Hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are plenty of personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of the United Kingdom.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise, from a modest tailor from the town of Voger in northern Italy to the idol of the international elita.
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with that.
"At least they don't give away their cigarette butts about your gorgeous carpet, as some beautiful pop music stars do," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a great host and hosts guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all enjoyed coming to his chalet in Gstaad," explains Tissen's ex-wife, a close friend of forgotten beauty like Marella Anyelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And despite that, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valery Mazza recalls the charismatic modeler.
One day we went to dinner at his house, after a fashion show in Spain Square in Rome, years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Valentino's style manifested itself in everything-- every detail of his apartment, in her decoration, in her food, in her music.
"Each of Valentino's guests made him feel important and loved," recalls "top model", whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during High Fashion Week in Paris.
"He never goes out of fashion because his designs are real works of art," she ends.
Parade of ancestry
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was turned into a glamour podium of sixty metres into a length that offers a change of roles: the visitor occupies the model seat and should defile by the podium, seeing "observers" from the greeks that shined the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the suit that Monica Witti used at Night, or the coat of wool and skin that belonged to Empress Far Dib.
In this audience, models shine names such as Sibylla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn und Taxis, Mette Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria, or Sofia Habsburg.
Nati Abascal and fashion designer, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "can't forget."
I remember him beautifully.
It was pants, a shirt, a jilt, and a jacket from the Autumn-Winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Natalie Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him to the others for his feminineity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess de Ferria.
I really like the colors he uses: there's a lot of light in them and they're "approach" to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion legislator Patricia della Jovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have the age and the reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
That time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear it to a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with coats, a corsage in a fold and a cut without a shave.
"It was a dream that came true," says the widow Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is out of time," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from a fashion designer with "maximum caution... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a collection of memories accompanying him."
"King of Fashion"
The great finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the modeler calls her sewing) to make this outfit out of ivory-colored silk with pearl incrustation, twelve species of different laces and a four-and-a-half-metre plume.
According to journalist Suzy Menquez, the greatest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of high fashion of the late 20th century, "returning clients from the highest light."
Inspired for many years by the "style of life" of the elite, Valentino is now her best representative.
Grand Cross Cavalier (mark of the highest rank in Italy), Labour Cavalier, Commander of the Order of Arts and Verbalities, awarded the Order of the Legion of Honour, Garavani collected as many honors as any of his clients' spouses.
"My attention has always been drawn to his sophistication, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance," recalls Dr.
Last time I saw him was at a gala dinner at the Ors Museum a month ago.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"He was impeccable, time doesn't exist for him".
If that's what the princess says...
The hardest job in the world: Kawah-Igen miners
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano along steep rocky trails
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
These include Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who earn a living from sulphur mining in the Kawah Ijen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfur gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes in contact with the air.
The pieces are huge pieces of sulphur, which can weigh as much as 70 kg in total, and he puts them in two bamboo baskets, lifts the baskets on his shoulders, and carries them up the cliffed stone road.
To the summit of the volcano, which is 2,386 metres high, only 250 metres are required, but it takes more than 40 minutes for the worn-out loaders to rise up with a turtle step, struggling with balance and cautiously groping the road so as not to fall or fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong move could cost them their lives, as happened to a tourist from France who fell off the Kawah-Igen Rocks a few years ago.
The Kawah-Igen mine earns 5 Euro cents per kilogram of sulphur that is extracted
Once they are at the top, they pave the way for themselves between tourists who are photographed as if they were circus monkeys and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometres to the scales that the mining company has placed just above, at a height of 1.850 metres.
This is the PT Kandi Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has operated this volcano since 1960 and, better not to say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for Rs. 10,000 (83 Euro cents) petrochemical production, as this mineral is common in daily life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"As the standard is to carry 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per walk," Anto explains to us, who usually performs three daily transports.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems a miser for such a non-human effort, it's three times what he would have earned in the field.
" The daily wage for miners is very high by local standards, where the coffee charge is Rs. 15,000 (€1.2) per day and the average monthly wage is Rs. 2 million (€167), " explains the loader who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
His salary there was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a valid reason which in Indonesia is as devastating as sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where only Hindus, and brought her to Java to accept Islam."
Anto's asthma, he's barely breathing, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are tearing because of toxic gases.
At his 27-year-old age, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah Igen, whose sulphur had already begun to affect him despite having a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, he coughs constantly, and his eyes cry because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
It's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a hotel doorman, but instead he does the work of a mule.
A dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at 2:00 a.m. because sulphur doesn't stop flowing out at night when her distinctive yellow color turns blue and glitters in the middle of the darkness.
By challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, lighting his way with a small lamp connected to his helmet, which he himself bought with his own money.
About 400 porters haul baskets of grey on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano.
Despite high profits, the mining company did not mechanize sulphur mining to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work on their own account and with such hardship.
In fact, they do not even receive part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) charge for photography, which, along with an entry ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), guards of this reserve charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mule men.
"This work is for livestock, not people," says Badrusin, a 42-year-old native porter who spent three decades in Kawah Ijena since leaving college.
Capable of up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will endure the job "as long as he can" because he needs money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm gonna die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns its throat and burns its eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in dense pillars of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so resilient that no one complains of their severe diseases... more serious, obviously than their usual breathing problems, arthrose, knee pains and shoulder ulcer, which deformed under the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unanik can only lift 50 kilograms in his 53s.
Each day, he and his companions carry 15 tons of sulphur out of the volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamansari, crossing a distance of 18 kilometres along a narrow trail among the bushes.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unanik, wide-opening a mouth that lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30 years old, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest jobs in the world: what human mules do with Kawah Igen.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy.
Singaporeans blame the career, stress and prices of housing and education for the absence of children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot's wife, we'll do our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the mint petal ads, but despite this – or perhaps because of this – this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like "Let's put the bao (bunk) in the oven" to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, cherishes the hope that through advertising they will be able to draw attention to the issue in entertainment form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do "their national duty."
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We're the world's worst reproducing like ourselves, so we felt that this was a subject that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried to do much, such as launch perfumes with pheromones or organize quick dating parties (blitz dating parties).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily working.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, which is to make a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take this lightly are the Singaporean Government.
It spends $1,300 a year on politics to encourage citizens to have more children.
The State package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, prolongs maternity leave and provides tax incentives.
But it's all low-performance.
Singapore is a rich and highly technological city state in South-East Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and its strict social control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Authority, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
It was last below 2 - what is known as the substitution percentage - in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, Director of the Policy on Couples and Families of the National Population Authority, said that the reason for "improved education" and "broader range of career opportunities".
"This allowed people to have a wider range of options regarding life goals and priorities other than marriage and family creation," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of singles and the postponement of marriage and the birth of children, which have resulted in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, immigration policies, which were aimed at sharply increasing immigration to counter population declines, had caused resentment among the local population.
Singapore has websites where there is an almost hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who have been criticized for keeping wages low and reluctant to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that last year Singapore's ruling party won the worst election since independence.
After the elections, an attempt was made to solve the problem through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility has a known impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, medical expenditure and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making efforts not to build so many small dwellings.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Manual went on to control the number of small apartments known as the “shoe box” that can be built in certain parts of the city.
These 46-square-metre apartments sell very well.
Nevertheless, there is a perception that they can promote a single lifestyle and lack incentives for developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yoo Sun, CEO of EL Developers, says that their shoe boxes are sold much faster than more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments buy for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash revenues are increasing.
However, he recognizes that the new regulations provide clearer guidance to developers who had previously been hampered if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too heavy.
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to the Singaporeans who work in the centre's financial quarter, they do not seem to have a special impact.
"People are very overstretched, housing is expensive, as is education, and that's why many people put it off," says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and prices for housing and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to encourage its citizens to give birth to their children, as far as childbearing is concerned, the final word remains with the Singaporeans.
Personal offline is personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, it refers to the characteristic of private or “a sphere of private life which has the right to protect against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social media?
Does he understand the dangers of discussing situations on the Internet that he would certainly not share outside the Internet?
elPeríódico interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on a personal plane, and "parole and user name" when they applied it to social media.
"My biggest secrets I wouldn't put on the post," says the ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain personal meaning on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he says.
On FB, I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I'm also having fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that's not mine, or someone who's acting stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish inappropriate photographs of naked people, crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother knows she has a password to one of the records.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just uploading them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he points out.
Without thinking, he replies that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't count on anyone who recommended him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter admits that he does not know the 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one had been trusted or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I get pressured or demanded, I'll just delete them from my account," he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is known today as cybermobbling.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on a social network.
He was threatened and extorted money.
"He never found out who it was," he assures me.
According to José, the victim did not delete the account.
"Only included confidentiality".
He then explains the sequence of steps to configure the account in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I would if I didn't like a person or if I wanted to.
"Although I know it's cybermobbling," he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a specialist in education and training, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a tool for searching for information, but with the arrival of these websites the rules of the game have changed," she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prensky, a teacher master at Yale University and author of work Digital Aboriginals and immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are they, children and young people born in the age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning," she says.
Explains that the topic is complex, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken, at an age when maturity is insufficient to do so."
"Also so that they are selective, while it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what confidentiality is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do so is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or would you like it if they published a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you sign the photos from the parties, do you ask permission from other people to celebrate them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to behave online the way they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Outside the Internet, man behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, as well as on social media," she argues.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a professor of primary education and an education consultant, explains the need for heads of families to read in good faith social media policies.
By understanding each of the paragraphs, they have good reason to talk to children about the prerequisites for opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published," he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR summit ends without the Lima Declaration
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically signed by seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed at the sixth ordinary meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Office of the President indicated on the front page that it would be transmitted after closure, but then confirmed that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
Questions about the text, they pointed out that the contents had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Umala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists ' access to Summit information has been limited all the time.
During the day, it was only broadcast, in the press room, a video of the Presidential Assembly without a sound, with the message "closed meeting, sound forbidden".
Few of the information that has been distributed to reporters has been conveyed by spokespersons of some UNASUR governments present at the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused dissatisfaction among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Subsequently, the Peruvian President's administration sent an e-mail to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was a statement by Umala, not an official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and that time, despite the insistence of the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was also not distributed.
The ASPA official website can verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities had endeavoured to ensure that all journalists were provided with transmission systems, but that information was as limited as possible.
The Summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the verdict of the Hague Court, which settles the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, gathered at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which starts hearing the statements of both parties on Monday in The Hague, as part of the accusation that Lima has made against Santiago.
"We will observe and implement a decision that will explain the differences that we are currently submitting to this international court," Umala said, next to his Chilean colleague.
“Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and international tribunals”, added Piñera, and welcomed the hand of Umala against the background of the flags of those two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would be subject to the International Court of Justice occurred immediately after Colombia protested this week the Pact of Bogotá, according to which it recognized the subordination of the verdicts of that international court to the maritime boundary with Nicaragua, which it considered to be erroneous.
The summit took place in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Roussef; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Olianta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, just after noon in Lima time.
The Head of State read the outcome document, in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects had been approved among South American countries, with an estimated investment of $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries would take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding residence agreements”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizens' insecurity and organized transnational crime, actions to increase access to medicines, low-cost Internet access in all parts of South America and to take into account the combined and effective risks of natural disasters”.
As Europe is in crisis, "the economic union (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our production base and anticipate a better future for our cities," added Umala.
"We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South America's spaces, especially in the village and border zones... unifying our countries and forming new economic schemes," said the Peruvian president in a read-through.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five related to Peru and were limited to transverse axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The outcome document also addressed the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve as a re-accession to the Union of South American Nations, from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united and to have good relations between neighbours, was another theme emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before taking part in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful manner the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the international court challenged by Bogotá.
"The day after tomorrow (Saturday), perhaps to meet President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
“Let us reconsider all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including a pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua”, he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we can handle this in the most civil and respectful manner possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they will have a presence at the inauguration of the new President of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also within the framework of the summit, the Ministers of Defence of the bloc met provisionally to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which is aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America should learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship”: Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President, Rafael Correa, has confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, should learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, stated to Peruvian State television that Europeans "killed each other during World War II" and in other clashes, "but now they are almost one nation."
He defended, in this context, the South American citizenship project, which the UNASUR participating countries endorse.
"There is a need to ensure the free movement of citizens and workers across any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactional sectors that want to bring us back to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador has also shown his support for the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the condition of diminishing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who lecture never make any commitments, and we South Americans, on the other hand, sign everything.
"It is unexplained that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington, D.C. and is funded by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum given by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assanjo.
Correa assured that he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles with him, but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that at the time “there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed”.
He also criticized Swedish justice for requiring that he come to his territory for questioning about an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish legislation itself considers it possible to implement it by videoconference, which could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London".
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of Assange's physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a slight lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian Head of State.
What is really there is a risk of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to confinement in a small space without being able to exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution to the problem of asylum granted to Assanju since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London by providing a security guarantee that would enable him to travel to Ecuador was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary and stressed that there had been negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate on human rights; we do not use that word here, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assanja's lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European jurisdictions," he mentioned.
And he thought, "If the UK gives a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it'll be over."
And if Sweden, as it perfectly allows its legislation, and as it has done in other cases, questions Mrs. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks him for Skype, the problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to act as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not tolerate “mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression”.
"The chief enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupt politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he was pleased that no journalists, “no bankers, no bourgeois hegemonic countries dominate Ecuador” and added that, having been re-elected, “will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to retain Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the mask of legality”, because in fact “it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy”.
The President of Ecuador also considered that the desire of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime boundaries between the two countries, following the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which proved to be in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty, was “excellently justified”.
This decision is not being implemented at this time.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
They must be processed together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also hoped for a good conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute before the same court in Peru and Chile, and said that “it is right for Latin America to have recourse to international bodies if the two countries undertake to take a decision, however heavy it may be”.
Regarding the opportunity to stand as a candidate for the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he was considering this opportunity “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult”.
Correa assured that if he loses in the February 2013 election, he would withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations such as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement felt it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
If won, it would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"It's a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to the treatment already planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean the deterioration of President Chávez's health," he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima in the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS mortality today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was announced that his AIDS test had yielded a positive result.
"I've been stunned," he recalls, despite the doctor's tact, the moment.
The boy hid it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease himself, he wanted to know as much about it as possible, and his efforts were fulfilled - he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the “oldest” patients in the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) HIV ward, where he entered in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He's been diagnosed with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which would be hard to believe in in the early 1990s -- too few treatment options existed then, too little knew about the disease, too biased towards the sick.
So even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection didn't want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, it was a sentence to have AIDS at those times.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so without compromising the quality of life.
However, unaware of their illness, many people still come when the virus has already damaged, has “destroyed” their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "the greatest achievement to date is that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," pointed out HCHG, head of the HIV department, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectionist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a sentence, but that life expectancy and quality of life depended on the degree of immune failure available to patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better life expectancy for those who did not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years when 500 CD4s were reported.
Simply put, the above means that a person who is diagnosed with HIV positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, “supporting control will be able to live without problems up to the age of 75”, he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be recalled that Mexicans today have an average life expectancy of 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has declined from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 deaths have already been recorded by May this year; however, it is alleged that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatalities?
Personally, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I picture it, that's how things are at our hospital.
At least for the past 12 years, we have had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients arrive very late because they are not aware of their infected condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He cited devastating data: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to perform diagnostics at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a massive scale, for all people who ask for it."
The proposal agrees with the experts and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as with the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who turned to a private laboratory for testing, motivated only by the fact that his friend did this and despite his young age, he was already in the AIDS phase and even suffered from Caposha's sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the common complications.
Things change when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything.
"If I die anyway, I'd rather get drunk three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, I do exercise, I take medication.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I care about myself and another person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage his statement to those who now, in the context of World AIDS Day, fear.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This presentation summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
The gap between health programmes and ordinary citizens is great, according to Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken up the issue of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, we've been given one or two before, now we're given 100 bags, and that's very good, but it turns out that there are those who still don't have access to the condom," he said.
Young people are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why are they for you?" is a popular question, with echidicism and condemnation by social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health workers who don't want to hear from teenagers, assured the promoter.
I suggest we change this inefficient distribution; that condoms be not just behind counters and that a hundred be in machines in public toilets in places frequented by young people.
It's not the encouragement of promiscuity.
It was not about paying for beer and a motel, and Governor Emilio Gonzalez responded when asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
"It's not sexy, it's best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
13.435 cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV) have been registered.
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking for new and combined AIDS cases and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections refer to the sex path, 6% through blood, and 2% to the perinatal path.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know that for one reported case.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that invalidates the restructuring of Vitro Group debt achieved through competition in Mexico, the scenario sets a fateful precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in a neighbouring country that has problems with capacity to pay.
It seems that procedures to support the survival of firms, which are permitted by Mexican laws, are not valid in the country of stripes and stars, in contradiction with international agreements.
In practice, the endorsement of the 15 June ruling by Judge Harlin Hale in the bankruptcy court of the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenceless in the face of the possibility of seizing their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the doors to the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to apply to the United States Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies as evidence.
As an introduction, while the judge of the case notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceeding concerns the competition proceedings before Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, for that purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law had been created, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without an inter-firm vote, recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt that Vitro subsidiaries had with the parent company would not have achieved the majority necessary to approve restructuring.
Nevertheless, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme has been adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, among them Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whose inter-firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Proceedings.
It is also true that by subtracting the votes of affiliates, Vitro creditors who fought against him in United States courts, namely vulture funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
This data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation that she has faced since 2008, affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States has struck at the country.
So far, the house of the Gonzalez Sad family will be filing an appeal to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote reaches its plenary, that is, five judges, because only three voted.
In the event of failure, a motion for certification would be submitted, which would require a review by the highest court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican Government as amicus curiae (the “other court”) describing the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, indicating that it exempts itself from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries in order to link it to article 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, i.e., the rules established for cases of intergovernmental insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Karambol from two ships: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Overall balance
Given the several-month-delayed complaints posted on the Mexicana de Aviación table against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraud, the Union Air Pilots Association has already discovered a bottle throat.
An institution led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morino has just submitted a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory body systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic on the transaction performed by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund F/589 of Bank IXE 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexican Airlines.
Resources would be used to purchase shares of the Hotel Professional Managing Company.
As you know, Askarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
Rounding Dragon Mart
Meeting on the weekend at a forum at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of general civil society endorsed the establishment of a broad front to counter the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We're talking, as you know, about a giant mall for the sale and distribution to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for 150 companies.
Canacintra had previously succeeded in bringing together governors of the south-eastern zone to confront monumental forces that leveled parts of the protected areas and posed serious threats against the industry.
Death of ACTA
With regard to the Government's rejection of the Senate's request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Trade Agreement against Counterfeiting, known as the acronym in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute, the case has already been archived.
As you know, the action has been carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself has disqualified the possibility to view it as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term housing developer Homex places 500 million pesos in the market.
The issue is the first of four identical, with a proposal to pay interest every 28 days.
Competival Comes to Life
Formed by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, information technology leaders, a consortium with the trade name Competival has just come to light, its purpose will be the market for software clusters in Central and South America.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes, an ardent basketball explorer, has been associated with this sport for over 60 years and has driven the world through it.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And yet, before the brain hemorrhage chained him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a minor player, a Major Basketball League player, Commissioner, and head of BSN with the Bahiamon Cowboys and the President of the Basketball Federation.
"I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as when I was president of BSN, CEO of the National Team and president of the Federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during Primera Hora's visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes doesn't exaggerate making that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things collected for his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamon's in the heart.
With the greatest emotion, he retains those who remember his way through the Cowboys, from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years as a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent, or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Minsey made his BSN debut.
Since then, Kuco Ortiz, who was a great administrator, has been in charge, as Reyes pointed out.
I remember that Gene Bartov, who was on his way here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, told me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7."
"Do you want to?"
And it was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who gained citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Mincy had brought the Bayamon Championship, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboys Championship with Gauss, but I was already at a distance, because by 1988 I had already been named Chief of the Federation.
By then, I had preferred to enjoy his achievements and Minsey's achievements in the national team.
I remember the first time we won from the United States during an Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we won fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze if it wasn't for the Canadian judge who forced us to replay the final game, Reyes said.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as is the one who won from Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one with the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and defeated the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won our bronze at the World Cup.
Not only were Mincy, Gaussa, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and 'Piculina' (Ortis) played on that team again, but also young (Havier) 'Tonito' Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihote' Morales, who was unable to participate in 1990 due to knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualification Tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like 'Kanito' Nieves, Pablo Alicea, and young Rolando Hurruitner to replace the players temporarily suspended for disorder in the Mar del Plata Pan American Championship, we won gold against all projections.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Piculin Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculin did.
And that doesn't take into account his career in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think is your biggest achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things I wanted to do, like regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, that Ponce boys play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and a course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
I listen to music the most, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world-renowned by his leading role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died Friday night due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided for The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas studio.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing again the landmark role he liked the most," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him at the Thanksgiving fair in Dallas.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was near Hagman when he died at Dallas Hospital, said her spokesman Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, gentle and talented, and I'll miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," confirmed Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted to drinking for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and suffered a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained prominence on television through the role of a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive gin girl played by Barbara Eden, and begins living with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedys that rarely aired, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971–72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included roles well-recognized by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his workshop interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the top of fame.
The CBS's drama series on the Ewing clan and other characters in its midst aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot J.R.?", conceived to create noise around the episode, full of emotions in which the character Hagman is almost killed, spawned international discussions and millions of dollars that were risked in bookmakers.
It also helped attract a record audience to the series at that time.
When the November 1980 episode was answered, an average of 41 million television viewers watched it and turned Dallas into the second-largest entertainment program in history, after the 1983 "MASH" final, attracting 50 million viewers.
It was sister-in-law J.R., Christine (in the performance of Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. prevented her and then threatened her that he would accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: an dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who wanted his wife an alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be placed in treatment.
"I know I must be on the gravestone J.R." Hagman said in 1988.
It's supposed to say, "This is an honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Prinsipal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled on Hagman's Friday as someone "large, both on and off screen."
He is unforgettable and indispensable to millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas issue were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT.
The recording of five episodes of the second season had already been completed and the sixth was in production, reporting to the channel.
Warner or TNT have not yet announced what will happen to the series after Hagman leaves.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shined in classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He attempted happiness on the New York theatre scenes in the early 1950s, and then served in the England Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met young Swedish artist Mai Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't include anything that I thought would hurt anyone or influence them in any way," he said to Prensa Asociada at the time.
After the liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients in fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go into surgery, and after," he pointed out in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a little while, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course that explores "The End of the World" begins.
Every week students study apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when religious professor Stuart Sharme decided to read the course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible bait: the end of the Mayan's "long reverse reference" calendar, on 21 December, which many people grasped as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what he would expect in the next couple of months: the catastrophic storm Sandy, the financial crisis that some call "longarmageddon", and the growing conflict that Israel is drawn into, a place where Christian end-of-time theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharma this week to students at Rutgers Camden University, New Jersey.
If we look at what's going on in the world today, as if we only had 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember what's bad for those who have an apocalyptic mind.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on "the end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Templ University, Associate Professor Barry Walker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that give rise to certain human actions.
If nuclear material were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to examples from real life.
"I tried to tell students what might be plausible and impossible," Walker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor Matthew Restall of Latin American History and his colleague Amara Solari, Associate Professor of Art and Anthropology, joined together to read a course called simply "The End of the World."
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Despite the “necessary destruction”, students must study, prepare projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be accepted on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students with no choice but to work "until the night the world is expected to end," said Restall.
Courses were quite popular.
"The mass ended in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-middle-scoring students, which 35 students enrolled in.
We received e-mails for weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked if there were more places.
Students in turn assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers Camden.
And the apocalyptic image of thought, secular or religious, is just a matter of solace or lack thereof.
Will Vekes, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that would teach it," he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone the professor, said they believed in the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project touched on the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last year at the University of Temple from West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which has several centuries in which people react to changes around themselves by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other places, people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in an English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, professor of religion at La Sal University, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course about the "end of the world" there.
"Philippines doesn't take part at the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at higher orders.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restal drew attention to what had long been said about many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers are careless about this date.
Some say they're going to end-of-the-world parties.
"Maybe I'll call one of my friends to laugh together," commented Samir Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
