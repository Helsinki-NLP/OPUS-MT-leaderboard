In my view, the literature program was formed by the Balzak-age ladies on the basis of their interests.
From 19th-century Russian literature, we preferred Danilev and Volkonsky.
They wrote belletrics, of course, from the point of view of those same gals of Balzak age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroes of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting to teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Micropacket Prestige model: comfort and natural composition.
In the mattress, the stiffness of the sides varies: the medium-hard surface is formed by latexed coconut fibre and natural latex, and moderately soft is a plate of natural latex.
The spring block with 1,000 springs per square metre is rapidly adapted to the body of the sleeper, warning the appearance of the wave or hamaka effect.
One of the advantages of the model is to distinguish breathing materials.
The latex, perforated for air-tightness, is perfectly ventilated in a natural way, as is the cocos coir.
As a result, a healthy microclimate of the bedroom is preserved.
The mattress is also subject to an extended guarantee period.
The term of the official guarantee from the manufacturer is five years, in fact the lifetime of the mattress is longer.
The protection against dust and pollution is placed on the detachable giccard cover supplied in the kit.
Buy an orthopaedic pillow in pairs to the mattress – it is recommended to maintain optimal spine position during sleep.
The filler determines the destination of the sides – coconut provides anatomical back support, latex relaxes the muscles.

Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccine inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany would not be final, but would continue with renewed force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of coronavirus vaccine are likely to be sufficient for full protection.
The leader of the Association of Physicians of Common Practice, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
This is reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
"We expect a fourth vaccination to be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert says.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccine can be "combined with influenza vaccine".
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccinations can help combat the spread of the new strain of the Omicron coronavirus.
And the new option is particularly dangerous.
Thus, Omicron is three times more likely to be re-infected than Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNtech / Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against contamination with the new version of the Omicron coronavirus.
BioNtech and Pfizer have shown that at two doses of the vaccine, the efficiency is significantly lower: "neutralizing potential decreases by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against Omicron Stamm infection," emphasized BioNtech and Pfizer.
That's why a third dose is needed.
The experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favour of reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, as Salzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both delta virus and coronavirus omicron variant.
"Israel's experience shows this very convincingly," the expert stressed.
Wobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 years
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from the company Pontoon21.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally created with use for ice fishing, not just for catch-off.
These vibs have greater weight than those of close analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuance of these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin of strong and rugged plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration in vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter-wib" catcher, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the catchiest is a simple monoton animation, i.e. movements up and down with a dyster almost without pause.
In planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when caught in a limited space slammed by underwater vegetation, corks, and other obstacles that can lead to a hook.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when catching a seam and large bass in the winter, and especially in the middle of the winter when point and aggressive baiting is required.
After reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib turns instantly and returns to the reference vertical.
No less successful Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter fishing pond trout.
To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with or without a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib by playing in the back is capable of irritating a passive pike that does not even react to a liver.
When caught, Bet-A-Vib capture demonstrates range and accuracy.
This vobler is understandable and not capricious, well combined with lescow and weave cords even large diameters.
To catch a pike, a skunk, a yersha or a dip, except for a regular current and a "step", sometimes with a "chirking" down the bottom.
If you're caught in busy places, you can switch the front triplet to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of hooks.
Among the baits of their Bet-A-Vib class are among the most resilient in work and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
With the same success, it can be used in both relatively small and rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, 7,000 Russian mercenaries were reported
Libya has more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company Wagner.
The President of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled Al-Mishri, announced this on Sunday, 12 December.
"There are currently more than 7,000 PMV Wagner mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabiya Air Base (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte) " , quotes Anadolu.
Khaled Al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries were “trying to capture” the central part of Libya, extending from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after “bring their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Save presence
According to an interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “residenced in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufre, is noted in the agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the VAC Wagner has the Kremlin's support.
Where else there could be mercenaries
According to the agency, Wagner is believed to be active in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licences for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries, as stated in the article.
According to the media, “vagners” were alleged to have fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not listed in the security forces or the legal registry, and its fighters are not on the personnel ' s manifest lists.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Let us recall that the post-predation 27 EU countries had previously approved a retrenchment against Wagner.
The decision is expected to be approved by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Libyan Supreme Council of State de facto is the second House of Parliament with advisory functions with its dominant Islamists, writing the TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single day of voting for the election of members of Parliament and the Head of State from 24 December to at least February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks before the election, and the chances of them going on time are rapidly declining," the material notes.
Against this background, the Libyan High Electoral Commission has postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, broadcasting Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy with the eyes of Russians
38 per cent of Russians see more success than failure in the country's foreign policy, and 29 per cent believe that failure prevails.
"Examples of Success - "Syria Protectd, Restored Peace There", "Northstream 2 Decision", "The World Threatened That Cool Armaments", "Crime We Retrieved".
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “insulation from the world”, a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paper-processing - all public services have become digital, too.
The Government of Dubai reported a complete abandonment of paper and digital technology.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirate news agency WAM.
"Today marked the beginning of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," stated the Crown Prince of the Emirate, President of the Dubai Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktum on Saturday.
The internal and external processing of documents in all public institutions in Dubai will now be done only digitally through dedicated information platforms.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health, HAC, police, municipalities, courts, etc. Many commercial entities have also joined the Government ' s initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document workflows began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, the authorities considered that 336 million paper sheets had been saved, representing 14 million hours of human labour and $353.8 million in monetary equivalent.
Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin had previously stated that e-services saved citizens two days a year.

Turkey's car production and exports fell below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November, against a backdrop of depreciation of lira.
As a result, the industry's performance at the end of 11 months was worse than last year's result, as reported by Bloomberg, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were released from factories in Turkey in November, 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
Some 75.9 thousand vehicles were sent for export, more than 25 per cent less than last year.
And while Turkey's car sector showed a positive trend last year at the end of the first 10 months of this year, after 11 months of 2021, car production was 0.3 per cent worse than last year's.
The reason for this fall was the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira, which lost 29 per cent against the dollar in November.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 HCB entities were granted credit grace in 2021
The First Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, spoke about the situation of small- and medium-sized business benefits, and transmits the MIA correspondent Kazinnew.
“According to information provided by the Agency for the Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan, this year, pursuant to a request from the Head of State dated 1 April 2021, Order No. 127 of 9 April 2021 was adopted by the Chairman of the Agency approving the Procedure for the Suspension of Loans of Small and Medium-sized Business Entities,” wrote Alihan Smailov in his reply to the parliamentary request.
He recalled that the arrangements for deferred loan payments included the provision by banks and microfinance organizations of deferred loan payments to HCIs, including IPs, prior to 1 April 2021 between 1 April and 30 June 2021.
The delay ranged from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the HCF subject.
The borrower's application may have specified a different period of deferment.
During the period of the delay, the borrower was suspended from its claim work, notice of the need to settle arrears, and the creditor's collection of commissions and other payments," noted the Deputy Prime Minister.
In 2021, second-tier banks received requests for deferred payments on loans from 603 HCC borrowers, of which 553 HCC entities received deferred payments amounting to 9.7 billion tenge.
At the IFO, 131 ISF entities submitted applications for deferral, of which 95 entities were granted a deferral of 105.8 million tenge," concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryazev suggested that people with low immunity can easily carry the strain of "ocmiro"
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity can handle it more easily than those who have a strong protective response from the body.
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryazev explained why the coronavirus strain could be dangerous.
The reason is worth looking for in the context of the outbreak of the virus.
Scientists believe that the “ocmyrone” originated in the body of an HIV-positive or immunodeficiency person.
I mean, in mutation, he didn't find any resistance to immunity.
He's more aggressive by this.
Because there was no answer to immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, he's got these Spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than he should have, their antibodies weren't cut during mutations, and he's commenting on the pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with reduced immunity could carry "ocmiro" more easily than those with strong body protection.
Turns out the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, it's not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's how it happens with pneumococcal infections when young people are killed by a 30-year-old, and old people 60-year-olds in the form of sneeze.
The young man’s immune response is mad, and it is completely inadequate: where one could only threaten with a finger, he beats like a gun at sparrows, ” concluded Sergei Puryazew.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus had dangerous side events, and the most unpleasant of them were pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial and viral.
If the former is treated very successfully and quickly, in the latter case, only symptoms - all hope for the body - can often be bathed.
The first sign of emerging pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication -- temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, throat scratching, coughing.
Pains on the right or left, abdominal pains can also indicate an emerging problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia before the end of the year, a growing generation of 12 to 18 years of age may begin to be vaccinated.
Virusologist, IFTI's head of the genomic engineering laboratory, Pavel Volchkov, noted that this category is very heavily affected by the cowboy.

Teath-In.
In those far-off '70s to '80s, no dance venue was without the tunes of this group.
And at home, they would dance with their friends to their music.
Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why obese people are victims of a cowboy.
The authors examined the fat tissue remaining from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes could be infected by coronavirus.
The immune cells in the fatty tissue, macrophagus, also contracted, showing a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also examined the fatty tissue of patients who had died from the cowid and found particles of coronavirus in the fat surrounding the various organs.
HIV and influenza viruses are known to hide in the fatty tissue using it as a reservoir in an attempt to avoid an immune system response.
That's probably what SARS-CoV-2 is capable of.
The biologist described the causes of dementia
Semen Goloshikin, a bioscience candidate, described the causes of dementia and how to prevent it in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from the disease.
The syndrome manifests itself in the gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty guidance even in a familiar environment.
Holosheikin noted that neurodemension, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and lack of certain vitamins are the most common causes of dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, increased cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, factors such as social exclusion and lack of active cognitive activity are possible," he said.
Dementia is also affected by harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and low mobility.
Among the early signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decline in abstract thinking.
"There is discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor," added biologist.
To prevent the occurrence of a disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of fitness, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.

Egypt returned some 30,000 illicitly removed artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo Government has managed to repatriate some 30,000 artifacts that have been smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, by Al-Hayat, Chief Inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, Chaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to recover 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were found at the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C.," he said.
Abdel Gauad clarified that all smuggled artifacts were recorded in the archives.
Department staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts “trace auctions worldwide and online sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that on return, cultural property was restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the recovered artifacts was the ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of an exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find the auctioned bust of the pharaoh Tutankhamon in London.
The Christie's Auction House held tenders on July 4 on which a bust of over 3,000 years of age was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This has sparked discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art item was illegally removed from the Karnak temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamon, depicted in the image of the sun god of Amon, has been stored in a private collection and has not been tendered since 1985.
How the relic entered Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively pursuing the repatriation of antiquity monuments illegally removed from the country at different times in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research by black diggers.
"The Crimean Tatars are not included," and that is correct, as the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are an independent people (near to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42,000 people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of that people is two words!
Only the Turkic language group combines them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal staff mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes Financial Times.
In Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount for the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a telecommunications operator partner.
Under the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees as they are used to deal with business with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if a staff member used it to meet a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have moved to remote mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to resolve business issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank management has set a deadline for staff to familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new claim.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life, 1925, was fruitful in terms of creativity, but most difficult for the poet and his ego to exist on earth.
He's already out of any literary association, spread with imaginism, he's himself, but known to be in demand, sometimes scolding heavily by critics, even evil, but the reading public is willing to carry it on their hands.
In a year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them real masterpieces, completed the cycle of Persian Motifs, written the poem Anna Snegin, published eight books, a collection of "Rius of Soviets".
And the main success was in late June 25th, the State Secretary concluded a contract with Yesenin to publish his writings in volumes 3.
None of modern-day Sergei Alexandrovich has been honored with such honor, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money, with a contractual fee of 1,000 rubles per month for 20 months (the factory director, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer received 200 rubles).
The funds were needed more than ever that year.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of the Lion of Tolstoy Sofier Tolstoy, and had to set up a family home, support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as a mother.
Life seemed to be getting better, there's something to be happy about, but for him, it's mostly dark tones, like there was a nightmare from the poem Black Man (written in November 1925 and published after Justin's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where that pain came from.
If the wind whistles
Over an empty and deserted field,
The way I grow in September,
She's brainwashing alcohol.
Many acquaintances have pointed out that Yesenin has given up heavily, looks badly, and is clearly ill.
There's more and more galls, more and more nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis of alcoholism was made by Sergei Alexandrovich, there were no credible documents left.
Let's say, in May 1923, when Yesenin at the insistence of his fourth wife, the Americans of Aysedora Duncan corrected their health in a clinic under Paris with Professor Peter Gunnushkin (again, Yesenin will get to him two years later, already in Moscow).
But the evidence of the poet's singing, the scandals on this soil, the police's reports are abundant, scattered across dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the poet's terrible novel with the green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Jesenin settled briefly with a friend, Imaginist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his home either in Moscow or in Peter, found it in rented apartments, hotels, or acquaintances.
The old people remember:
"He only came to sleep, and in most cases in an insane, drunken state.
One day, returning at four in the morning, Jesenin fell on the stairs...
When he fell, he scratched his face and snored.
When he regained consciousness, he began coughing constantly, spraying the entire sheet with blood..."
Yes, and Yesenin himself after his voyage to Europe and the United States (there was a dry law in the States then, but Duncan brought with her a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I haven't seen anything in there except the boar and the streets...
I'm at the end of it, and I've stopped remembering people...
Well, I've been drinking, of course...
And I was drinking because I've had a longing."

Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Economy 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Economy is a modern performance of the budget model in a premium-class line.
The mattress is based on a block of independent double springs of Duet.
A softer small spring is inserted inside the large spring.
This allows the burden to be spread evenly over the mattress.
On both sides, the mattress is supplemented by a refill, artificial latex.
It's an analogue of natural latex, but it's denser and less expensive.
The flexibility and turgidity of this material enhances the comfortable effect of the mattress.
Artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it doesn't absorb moisture and dust.
A mattress would be great for a couple with a large difference in weight (from 30 kilograms).
With the smart springs, there's no wave effect when the light partner rolls on the side of the heavy one.
Nice, soft on the feel of the cover of the practical Sense giccard will be asked by a layer of synthepon.
Natural tissue doesn't accumulate static electricity.
It is possible to produce this model of mattress in a twisted version (vacuum roll pack).

He's much more responsible than I was when I was his age, or my husband, who had trouble with the law from time to time before the wedding.
Father takes care of his young daughter.
And he likes, like he wrote the Lermonts, "weird love."
Why did the girl cry at the exam before she failed it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't a school.
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
He will.

The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon"
Poland's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Pavel Jablonsky, expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intended to return to such an "operation" next year.
A statement was made by the deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Jablonsky, sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stop Lukashenko", but he "is actively seeking new ways."
A Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many places around the world”.
As kp.ru wrote, the European Union had previously enacted the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It addressed 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared their willingness to further expand restrictive measures against the Republic “if the situation in the country does not improve”.
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by the Senica hat": When a velvet jacket makes a man a joke
The 2021 social events were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first person to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
As early as September, he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional "Bonda" butterfly at the premiere of "Not the Time to Die."
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first put on a green velvet jacket for the award ceremony of The Earthshot Prize, an inappropriate royal dress code, and then chose a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety Charitable Foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was on itself and Lionel Messias.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh Golden Ball in the Dolce & Gabbana velvet jacket.
By the way, his sons were wearing the same clothes.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet male jackets in Russia.
According to service analysts at Gazette.Ru, they were purchased 1.4 times more frequently.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with linings and attached silhouettes, the main colors are dark beige, velvet, dark blue, and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is between 3,000 and 6,000 rubles, with men choosing to buy velvet suits only - they choose less frequently.
You can buy them from more than online critics.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the velvet jacket segment this season, the velvet jacket is featured in almost all brands - both Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The Gucci model is considered the most desirable and featured in one of the premieres of the film "Gucci House" by the brand ambassor Jared Leto.
By choosing expensive stamps, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
The special thread binding technology produces dense fabric with vorsy exterior texture and smooth inner side.
More budgetary options are made up of cotton or polyamide, but they also serve less.
The fashioned expert Lamoda, Ilya Vahoshkin, warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, it is not his model or appearance that matters, but its relevance.
"Barhat requires evening light, so such a jacket is perfect if you're going to a party or a solemn event," explains Wahoshkin.
Another important criterion for choosing a velvet jacket is the status of its buyer.
"The man in the velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced party with wealth," says Telegram channel authors about men's fashion "Pretty Brammell." - The owners of velvet jackets tend to belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They're just invited to a social event where the dress code is always listed.
Ilya Wahoshkin offers to combine a velvet jacket with similar outfits: classical trousers with arrows, one-ton shirts, silk ties, lofers with brushes, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from the Brammel Beauty are confident that the appearance of a private employee on the company's velvet jacket will also be inappropriate, but if it's the "leader in charge of this event, yes," he's on the subject.
If the employee is lower in rank and his purpose is to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to kick out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will certainly appreciate the phrase "not according to Senka hat," the editors of the Telegram channel think about men's fashion.
It's a very mixed feeling from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, so exhaustingly pulls.
And it's completely unassociated with a nice young girl's face.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you luck in life!
It's all about money-- alternative energy is well lobbied, which means it's paying.
A billion-dollar investment.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also out of the question - both gas and oil and coal have been bought cheaper than they are selling now.
Fuel demand is wild.
There's a penny dripping.
Then who's in?
As usual, a private buyer.
Do Indian issues touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be regarded as fools who have “missed” the energy crisis.
They did their job.
That's a good piece of shit.
I didn't see any beautiful people in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within average passengers.
Perhaps if such characters are confident in their beauty so much that they decide to show it to the whole car, they will not be able to get to them, most likely.
But it's only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "pretty women" but certainly not because of their appearance.

The immunologist stated that revaccination in four to five months' time would help to protect against the coronavirus strain of the "omicron "
A revaccination in four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection of "micron".
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Krüčkov, who called the inoculation six months later, given the appearance of a new strain, "a very large period"
"In previous strains, this was normal, but now the best way to do the procedure is in five months, and people with chronic diseases in four," the expert said, calling for a re-vaccination in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kručkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person was given two shots and a booster, or he was overtreated and vaccinated, or vaccinated and overtreated, he was given "hybrid immunity", i.e. antibodies are many and neutral enough," the expert explained.
The G-7 warned Russia of “scale consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
The G-7 countries (United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States) issued a statement on the outcome of the Liverpool meeting of the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
It emphasizes that Russia's “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have enormous consequences and will cost a great deal” in Moscow, but the concrete measures are not described in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine”, the statement states.
The Ministers further call upon Russia to "remote escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations with regard to transparency of military activities", as President Biden of the United States spoke during a video call to President Putin of the Russian Federation on December 7.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in a Norman format to achieve full compliance with the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine”, the G-7 Foreign Ministers also state.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious price in return," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as to the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's cautious position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement also states.
Earlier this afternoon, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Trass, stated that Russia would face "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
She said that the meeting showed "the united voice of the G-7 countries, which accounted for 50 per cent of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have a huge impact on Russia."
Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective from omicron staff
The efficacy of the vaccine from Pfizer-Biontech against the coronavirus omicron staff is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong came to this conclusion, transmitting South China Morning Post (SCMP).
Vaccines were found to be less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antivirus activity against the original Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the Omicron variety," said Professor Malik Peiris.
However, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe current of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had previously predicted the evolution of the coronavirus pandemic, given the impact of the omicron staff on it.
The study concluded that Omicron Stamm could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increase mortality unless additional measures were taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence accused FRG of blocking NATO arms shipments to Kiev.
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexey Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened its position on the rifles by declaring them to be non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons through bilateral agreements with the allies.
These include the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
However, FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany, Andrei Melnik, expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to supply arms to Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany had attributed its refusal to provide weapons to the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the “occupation” of part of Ukrainian territory by Russia.
The same “illogical” position, I am sure, will be preserved by Germany under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky stated that Kiev expected help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected to “be Ukraine's technical partner”, added the President.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, Robert Habek, co-chair of the Green Party of Germany, visited the Republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

Mercedes protested the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix result
German team Mercedes, whose pilot Lewis Hamilton at the Abud-Dabi Grand Prix finished second after Red Bull driver Max Ferstappen, filed a protest against the final result of the race, reports to the Formula-1 press service.
Mercedes believes that there was a violation of Form 1 48.12 and 48.8 during the race.

According to the second, Ferstappen ahead of Hamilton to the permitted "restart" zone.
Let's add that now the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix result that Ferstappen ahead of Hamilton by 2.256 seconds and won the Formula One World Championship are preliminary when Mercedes' protests are considered.
G7 warned Russia of responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine
The G7 Foreign Ministers warned of “serious consequences” for Russia if it continued its military aggression against Ukraine, as indicated in the final statement of the parties.
The meeting also noted that it condemned the strengthening of Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and costs," says a statement published on the UK government website.
The G7 Ministers and the EU's supreme representative noted that “they are united in their condemnation of Russian armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine”.
The head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Elizabeth Throuss, at a press conference in Liverpool, warned of the "greater consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to renounce its aggression against Ukraine," she said (quota on TASS).
Earlier at the Liverpool summit, the G7 Foreign Ministers agreed that, in order to resolve the crisis due to the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties needed to return to the negotiating table.
The negotiations were in the "Normand format".
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke for the dialogue on Ukraine in the “Normand format”.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Maria Zakharova, said that, in calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries had "written in their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes."

Ways to recover stolen money through an Internet store revealed
There are several ways to recover the money stolen through an Internet store and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were discovered by information security experts in interviews with the RBC.
For example, in order to reduce the risk of large losses when bank card data fall into the hands of perpetrators, it is recommended to keep fixed assets in a map or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Some of the savings can be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as necessary.
Experts also recommend a separate map for online purchases.
If the money was stolen in stores that do not use 3D Secure security technology, a return procedure can be launched.
“Under the rules established by payment systems, unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure are the responsibility of the participant in the payment chain who does not use the service”, the representative of the Promsbank explained.
The expert from the Ecompay international payment provider Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer had the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator used a map on online resources that did not require two-factor authorization, the transaction could be challenged and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases Internet stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Public Chamber member Catherine Mizulina, director of the Secure Internet League, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 cases of fraud had been reported, ranging from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.
She said that a single window for complaints against online fraud could be an effective solution under the current circumstances.
Scholtz came to Poland to discuss “Northern Flow 2” and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholtz, came to Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops at the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline “Northstream 2”.
Although Scholtz stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations from each other.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Mateusz Morivecki, stated that he would call on Scholz to oppose the Northern Flow 2, which is expected to deliver Russian gas to Germany by bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland ' s efforts to stop the flow of migrants attempting to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing party “Law and Justice” violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation took precedence over EU regulations.
The new German government sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not make a public commitment to stop Northern Flow 2 in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
American officials told Congress members that they had reached an understanding with Germany about stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a high-ranking U.S. Congress official reported Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholtz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the G-7.
Dimitri, look closer.
The view outside the window is the same, the window size has not changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room was removed, so part of the second window is visible.
In fact, people who are not familiar with the initial planning are in doubt.
And I know these apartments very well, and I can see how they rescheduled them.
Make it okay with them.
It's always surprising when they write about the means to wash the sink, the toilet, the windowsills, the taps.
You know, once a year on Easter, you wash them, which you have to clean up.
Just don't let it get dirty.
The Ministry wants to give writers residences.
The future Fund for Support of Russian Letters will be transferred by the State to the federal property inherited from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the USSR Literary Fund.
It will be based on the creation of authorial residences, and has been informed by the Parliamentary Gazette to the Mincifres, which will be the founder of the foundation.
The Ministry is preparing a draft presidential decree on the establishment of the Fund for Support to Russian Letters.
The Explanatory Note clarifies that the foundation will be entrusted with the task of, inter alia, targeting and preserving buildings and structures once owned by the Soviet Union of Writers and Litfond.
“The Russian Federation has acquired a significant number of properties previously owned by the USSR Literary Fund, including those located in the town of the writers of Perjelkino, the village of Komarovo of Leningrad Oblast and others”, reported the Parliamentary Gazette in the Ministry's press service.
The draft decree requires that the statute of the Fund should state that it “is designed to facilitate literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of the literary community”.
“The creation of conditions for creative activity” refers to the creation of writing residences on the basis of transferred property in different regions of Russia, in which the conditions for creativity would be comfortable”, explained our publication in the Ministry of the Interior.

Doctors warned of the risk of prolonged use of excreta after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Jartseva and Sergei Tokarev warned of the danger of uncontrolled use of excreta after the coronavirus infection COVID-19 and before vaccination against coronavirus.
A therapist, immunologist Irina Jartseva, said that self-preventing the possible formation of clots after COVID-19 could cause a stroke.
Jartseva explained that not all blood products were intended only if the patient had been hospitalized, had been in hospital, and had suffered complications.
The doctor appoints anti-coagulants (blood-flamming drugs that prevent excessive clot formation) on the basis of evidence.
She reported that there is now a darkening, a long-running drinking of anti-coagulants and the resulting complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (brain hemorrhage).
Urfo's chief prophylacticist, scientific director of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, doctor of medical sciences Sergei Tokarev, in a conversation with URA.RU, said that disorderly anticoagulants are now often used by Russians before being vaccinated against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe questionable advice on the Internet and begin to take care of themselves.
There are citizens who, by their decision, begin to accept anti-coagulians a week before vaccination.
And in pre-inoculation examinations, doctors notice bruises.
He stressed that it was extremely dangerous to take any medication without knowing the cause of any symptom.
Potato was called a superproduct to protect against hypertension

Our money in the church wall will be paid $20,000 to plumbers.
The plumber who found the money in the church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will be paid the award.
This is reported in a press release by the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in the major evangelical Church of Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians will be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021, the plumber Justin Caughley repaired one of the church toilets and discovered thousands of bags of money and cheques under thermal insulation.
He passed on the finding to the church and, according to him, received no thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do," quotes KPRC-TV.
Apparently, the discovery was linked to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
About $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in cheques, which were kept in the church safe, were then missing.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any loss.
Nevertheless, a $25,000 reward was announced for information about criminals.
Justin Caughley could not claim this amount because the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at the time had spent $5,000 on the award and later received another $20,000 in gift from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the integrity of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
It was previously reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her remarks, her actions are her characterization as a real person.
That's why the attitude towards her is so negative.
And it's not that "she's financially richer than any writer," as they say here.

China has a new case of human infection with avian influenza virus
A new case of human infection with avian influenza virus from a highly pathogenic variety of H5N6 has been reported in China.
This was reported by RTHK radio with reference to the notification to the health authorities in Hong Kong, and transmitted to TASS.
A 68-year-old resident of Hueyzhou Township in the southern province of Guangdong, who kept the poultry in his household, became infected.
His condition is assessed by doctors as critical.
The world's first human infection with the H5N6 virus was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens were obliged to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, a judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF), Luis Robert Barroso, was ordered to require a code-passer to enter the territory of the State.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have anti-inoculation indications are exempt from the vaccination certificate.
Also on the list of exceptions are persons coming from countries where the lack of a vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, Pre-Carnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flows," noted Barroso.
Previously, Brazilian authorities had ordered anti-coronavirus tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
Full COVID-19 protection circuit closed
A virusologist, doctor of medical sciences, a well-deserved scientist in Russia, Anatoly Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
This, he said, could be achieved through injection and the use of a nasal vaccine.
Internasal use produces a large amount of immunoglobuline A. When the vaccine is injected, this does not occur.
Immunoglobulines A protect the mucous shell, so the virus can't penetrate the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulin G (antitela) form.
And if you inject both vaccines, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's no solution to double vaccinations yet," the medic told me.
Urfo's chief prophylacticist, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergei Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of applying nasal vaccination together with injection is the opportunity to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help to ensure that the protection of the body was supposed to be the maximum in that case.
Earlier, Nizhgorod District Health Minister David Melik-Guseinov stated that a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
That was, he said, the case in other countries, where another wave of the pandemic had come earlier.
Inna, um...
I've been talking to the cobelle for a long time now, if you're willing to trade the warm house, the cormac, the caress, the love, and the games for a running bitch, then go ahead.
But the song was trained and smart.
He chose my company and went home.
On video, a way that works 90 percent of the time.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I've stopped a lot of owners from running after the dog, although they owe it to me that there, 200,000 of them running (pops), right by the hand, and taking away the other way.
In the end, the 200,000 picked the host, not the dog that was running around.
Mass protests against vaccination continue unabated in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed their dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against the cowboy mandatory.
As of February next year, the poor will have to pay a fine of €3,600.
The Spanish, outraged by the authorities ' health policies, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held posters saying, "It's a false pandemic," "I won't be vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the Autonomous Community, a code certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports has been taken by the authorities in several regions of the country in the face of an increase in the incidence of coronavirus.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against tightening restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then developed into clashes with the security forces.
A group of demonstrators started throwing stones at police officers.
Law enforcement officials responded by using water cannons.
Nikolai S., even Wikipedia does not agree on this.
Kashevarova-Rudaya is also designated as the "first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve this title.
There is only one thing we agree with Zaharova: the Americans carried only death and plundering of any country, wherever it appeared.

WHO has detected “micron” already in six dozen States
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that a new strain of coronavirus had already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the proliferation of a new strain could have disastrous consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was described in a WHO report.
According to the organization, the strain was already found in 63 countries as at 9 December, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has not been actively disseminated since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new version of coronavirus.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain may, according to preliminary data, circumvent the extent to which the delta strain is spread, the Indian version of coronavirus, which now leads all countries without exception.
Prior to that, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Gebreiesus, stated that Omicron Stamm could have a significant impact on the progress of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were reached in Britain.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will replace "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of patients in Britain alone will be about 1 million. That is, with a few hundred people officially sick in the Kingdom at the present time, estimated to be up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the amicron strain, and at the peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
What the British health care system will not be able to handle.
The situation is compounded by the fact that recent studies show that the efficacy of the vaccine from Pfizer-Biontech against the amicron strain is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
How the Russian "Sputnik V" reacts to the "micron" is not yet known is gonna make sense in the next few weeks.
The Gamalea Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the amicron strain.

At least seven people died and 175 were affected by heavy rains that hit the north-eastern Brazilian state of Bahia and its neighbouring Minas Gerais.
This is reported to TASS with a reference to rescue services.
An extra-tropical cyclone has been raging on the border of these states since mid-week, bringing the rainfall in the region to 450 mm. Twenty-five municipalities in Bahia have declared a state of emergency, some of which have experienced the most devastating floods in 35 years.
The site destroyed several bridges, two river dams, and the traffic on three routes.
According to rescue workers, some 5,700 people were homeless and 6,700 others were forced to flee their homes.
More than 85,000 people in the region were affected.

Russia has been warned of a new scheme of fraud.
The perpetrators began looking for new manoeuvres for fraud in video messages.
It's written "News" with a reference to experts.
According to Ivideon's product director Zaura Abutalimova, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communication means are diphexies.
In this case, fraudsters create fake videos based on actual records involving the victim.
Thanks to this neuronet, it is possible to reproduce the patterns of a person’s behavior accurately.
Abutalimov added that using a diphex, perpetrators can call victims' acquaintances via video link or create a video featuring a copy of a person for the purpose of blackmail.
"Such forgeries can easily provoke bulling, as a horseshoed intruder can place people in ridiculous, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-writers," said the expert.
leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Wetkol in turn noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of video-based technologies.
David, add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that all of this was bought in a small town where the local mentality did not allow me to paint too much and walk in short skirts, to show stockings and tights on my feet.
It's a province, but there was this stuff in the store.
In the big cities, Muslim women both painted and showed their feet.
That's how it is in Dushanbe, it's a big city, the capital of the Republic.

Five actions listed to help avoid diabetes mellitus
Blood sugar problems are among the most common in the world.
Some, however, do not attach much importance to this, and for nothing.
Diabetes mellitus can eventually lead to severe complications and even death.
Preventive interventions play a central role in preventing the emergence of diseases.
For example, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the quantity of a variety of drinks and switching to regular water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar to a dangerous level when used in excess.
So the first step on the road to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
The disease is affected not only by malnutrition but also by habits.
Many moves are needed to reduce the risks of diabetes mellitus.
Experts recommend a low-carbon diet.
Such a diet would not only help to reduce weight, but would also protect against sudden fluctuations in sugar levels.
Many cells must be eaten to protect against diabetes.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to a sense of satisfaction, the release of digestive juices, and improved food absorption.

Dr. Pavlova told me about the day off migraines of workaholics.
Several factors may lead to a deterioration of well-being on the weekends.
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working hours is often the "morning of the day off", described by a well-known endocrinologist, a candidate for medical science, a senior researcher at the Department of Basic Medicine of the Ministry of Health, and the scientific director of the Zuhra Pavlov Institute of Systems Medicine in his telegram channel.
She said that workaholics who suffer from headaches, fractures and weakness are particularly affected during the weekend.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the week’s accumulated fatigue, there are many objective reasons for the body’s negative response to changing conditions.
Our lives change dramatically over the weekend.
"We sleep long, we lie on the couch all day, we probably eat more and drink less," the doctor argued.
Because of overeating and lack of water, gravity and breakage."
The late rise plays an additional role.
So if you get up three hours later than usual, there's a reaction called jetslag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
In order to determine which of the factors are critical to the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended that we find out what is most changed on the weekends.

South African scientists have declared the Pfizer vaccine to be ineffective against "micron"
In South Africa, the Pfizer vaccine against "mikron" was declared ineffective
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted research and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the coronavirus omicron staff.
It is estimated to (the level of neutralization of “micron”) correspond to (the level) of efficacy of the vaccine of 22.5 per cent against infection with symptoms, which ... cast doubt on the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, as stated in the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
In doing so, the experts explained that the drug could be saved from a serious current of disease.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the coronavirus omicron staff could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How many hidden sugars are in the usual foods?
Sugar is not the best source of good nutrients.
Its excess in diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and cancer.
Consumers should consider that hidden sugar, an ingredient similar to calorie sugar, composition and glycemic index, may be listed under an unknown word in the product.
Several dozen names, essentially for sugar, can be presented on the label.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fruit.
There may also be other hidden sugars such as dextrosis (sahar derived from maize), leftulose (fruit sugar), melasse (black molt), agava syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disacharides, and they can be not only in confectionery but also in ketchup, doctoral sausage, bread, etc.
The most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and to many different names of sugar, as stated in Roscia.
The different types of sugar vary in taste, but whatever the name of the ingredient in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or untreated, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar because it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the package, but also that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholtz: Gas will lose importance to Germany in 25 years.
The new chancellor of FRG Olaf Scholtz stated that gas imports were losing importance for Germany as the country continued its transition to decarbonization of the economy.
He said that Germany was planning to eliminate gas, oil and coal altogether by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," said the chancellor.
Scholtz noted that Germany continues to be committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is now important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement recording Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation.
Earlier, the head of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Annalen Berbock, stated that the process of certification of the Northern Flow 2 pipeline was ongoing.
According to the Minister, in the framework of coalition negotiations and negotiation of a coalition treaty, it was stated that European energy law should apply to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline was still "uncompliant" by the European Union.

Hackers hacked into Indian Prime Minister's Twitter
Hackers hacked into the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Perpetrators had time to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal means of payment and that the country had already purchased a crypto.
Modi's office was asked to ignore new messages.
The Premier's representatives said they reacted quickly on Twitter - access to the account was restored.
India's premier's service was already hacked into in 2020 and called for donations to the foundation through cryptophones.
In the referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians had voted in a referendum against the independence of their territory.
However, the level of participation in this third ballot was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by the local authorities, 3.51 per cent (2,755 people) of New Caledonia's voters voted against New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.9 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians taking part in the election.
As these interim results of France-Presse comment, "the outcome of these elections did not leave room for doubt", as supporters of independence called on voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed the referendum on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago was preventing a full and “honest” campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for a third victory for French New Caledonians, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, and in 2020 53.3 per cent voted against independence.
As the separatists have said, they do not recognize the results of the last ballot and will challenge them at the United Nations.
As reported on Sunday, 12 December, at the Elise Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is to speak on the outcome of the referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has given much impetus to the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates expressed their preference for the Territory to remain in France, as it was “the last region of the European Union presence in the Pacific”.
"New Caledonia must necessarily remain French," Eric Zemmoor repeatedly said.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecress, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro encouraging the Caledonians to remain French.
For its part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position, "because it is not his responsibility."
Nevertheless, the President added, "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of Caledonians be France's choice."

WSJ readers criticized an article about Russia-US relations
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell's article, in which he described his vision of Russian-US relations.
The author expressed concern that the West was allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger posed by Moscow and has made a number of offensive remarks against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries "to stand united against Russia".
WSJ readers expressed their opposition to the American professor's position.
"There's quite a lot of false information in this article," quotes RIA News a comment from one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to lose it, and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and NATO allies will never engage in a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine's sake," another noted.

A magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred in the Kuril Islands
The 5.2 magnitude earthquake occurred near the smoking island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km north-east of the city of North Curilsk.
Ochag lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Previously, seismologists recorded an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude in Peru, in which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing a new generation of jet drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish factory, a jet unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) of the ANKA type will begin to be built.
This was reported on 11 December by a freelance adviser to the head of the Ukrainian President's office, Kareni Arrestović.
So they're capable of acting against air objects, against other drones.
Even against a manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of Turkish avionics: Corps and so on," quotes his Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA vehicles, Arrestović explained that they were jets and not piston drones.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed its "by all characteristics."
The first batch of UAVs is due by the factory at the end of next year, and has concluded Arrestović.
The ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The previous day, the Ukrainian General Staff classified the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the combined forces in Donbass.
On 6 December, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky reported that construction of a factory to manufacture modern military drones had begun in the country.
He said Ukraine intended to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence concluded an agreement for the construction of a centre in the Kiev region that will provide training and testing and maintenance of the Turkish Bayraktar drone.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office described the memorandum as "a major real step forward".
At the airport, two lions escaped from the container.
The lions escaped at Changi Airport in Singapore.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape a container of seven lions arriving on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions lay on the roof of the container.
The beasts couldn't get away from him because of a nearby safety net.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of Mandai Wildlife Group employees running all Singaporean zoos.
They have immobilized lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
In Phnom Penh, Cambodia's capital, the lion had previously been reported to have escaped the owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, the people were not injured.
Experts have warned of the risk of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies show that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not lack folic acid are less at risk of contracting certain types of cancer, in particular colorectal cancer.
However, the excess dose contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
University of Alabama Professor in Birmingham, Dietologist Beth Kitchin recommends monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimum dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if there is a substantial deviation from this figure, either more or less.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in pills without a doctor's recommendation, to watch the dosage, and to avoid milk cereal and other foods that contain folic acid.
Rachel Fine's nutrition consultant previously called folic acid a substance that slows ageing.
Since it is, among other things, contained in avocado, Fine recommended that men, after 50 years of age, eat more of this fruit.
In the UK, about 75,000 people may die by April due to Omicron Stamm
Predictions by British scientists show that the spread of coronavirus omicron staff could cause up to 75,000 deaths in England in the next five months unless the restrictive measures are tightened in the winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), transmits TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the British Cabinet Emergency Research Advisory Group, at least 25,000 deaths due to the Omicron strain will have been recorded in the country by April 2022, and a total of 175,000 patients will have been hospitalized.
In addition, more than 2,000 patients per day will be admitted to hospitals at the peak of the disease.
"Serious measures to control coronavirus may be needed to prevent the National Health Service from overburdening if the omicron staff is more contagious than the delta option and current vaccines cannot rule out infection," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
The UK Health Safety Agency has previously reported that if the rate of Omicron Stammy spread is maintained at current levels, about 1 million cases will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, however, the omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently, 1,898 cases of coronavirus Omicron Stamm have been detected in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
However, on 9 December, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, pointed out that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superchats grew by a quarter in the world.
This year's superchat construction and next year's orders beat the world's record despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and combat climate change.
The number of yachts ordered in the ship's registry was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In an era of climate change mitigation, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and the money for a floating fortress for 50 million pounds or more will not decrease, writes "The Guardian".
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25 per cent more vessels were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn't been such a rush in the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear contamination on land and prefer to escape the pandemic on their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to coronavirus.
If all of these people used to go to the office and meet with business partners personally, now most of them are working remotely, and negotiations are taking place on the zoo.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards take orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more as long as their yacht is ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior by the rich and call it decadent.
The wealthy, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of travel to space, life on yachts, or flying on their own planes is an irritating society because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists call on governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they realize that with such money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of super-cats ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length of more than 100 metres.
The Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-metre-long REV Ocean yacht.
After we hit the water, it'll be the largest yacht in the world.
The boat has a "moon basin" and a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
On the existing super-heights, helicopter sites, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, such as McGregor's fighter's yacht, a platform for martial arts. Professor of Economic Anthropology at the American University in Indiana Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas electos, the carbon footprint produced by super-rich people is insignificant.
But it has symbolic significance, considering that the world's multibillionaires are just over 2,000 people.
This is just another example of the over-consumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than that of the average resident of the planet.
While one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the largest pollutant on the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trail sprung onto his Eclipse yacht 162.5 metres long.
Even if the owner is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner may call the captain and command to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superchat owners do not cause the sympathy of other people when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that there is no space for their giant ships to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for vessels more than 50 metres away.
A dangerous week-long dose of alcohol leading to intestinal cancer has been determined
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of cancer.
This is written by Daily Express.
Experts concluded that the consumption of four or more alcoholic beverages per week was associated with an increased risk of cancer.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in alcohol consumption.
Moreover, moderate-drinking men have a higher risk of intestinal cancer than women.
The exact cause of this type of cancer cannot be determined by scientists, simply noting that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or more precisely all, dogs are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they don't know how four-legged pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have been conducting various experiments to see how intelligent animals are.
Although the dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as human, a new study proves that the dog can react consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or compose poems, understand nothing about politics, economics, and art, yet they often manage to fool their masters.
Some breeds, experts believe, show better results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics are not yet sufficient for accurate conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses, such as Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and that they are not inferior to a two-year-old child in their learning ability.

In Ukraine, the US and Russia are ready to trade.
The U.S. and Russia will "trade" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, as stated by analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for the publication "The Glare".
In his view, Washington and Moscow were planning to continue negotiations on United States safeguards in the near future to ensure that Ukraine would not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries “to enter anywhere”.
If you're offered something that's obviously unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not gonna bargain, you're just gonna send an offerer.
And for Ukraine, there's going to be a bidding exercise," wrote the analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks a dialogue with Kiev.
"Training takes place covertly, quickly and immediately to offensive action, rather than waiting for the group to detect and deploy opposition forces," he said.
China promotes the development of the railway industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway and Equipment Exhibition, held in the city of Zhuzhou of Hunan Province / Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, noted the representative of Howe Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running along the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure the increased reliability and efficiency of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased rail transport exports and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “Chinese speed”.
In May of this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co.'s production line, Ltd, dropped the first two-story electric express trains developed in China for export to Europe.
At a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a pilot operation of the subway train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will be on the subway line connecting the centre of Istanbul to the city's airport.
Traffic on this subway line will be opened next year.
This will be Turkey's fastest subway line at 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's Railway Equipment Industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaosyan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Committee for International Trade Facilitation/CCRMT/.
"This industry makes up the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment on the world market," Feng Yaosyan said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of railway equipment, with a full range of aids and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosyan, the country ranks first in the level of electrification of railways and in operating runs on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed early signs of dementia
Biology candidate Semen Goloshikin, in a conversation with Radio Sputnik, listed early signs of dementia.
He said that signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and a decline in abstract thinking.
There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor, said the specialist.
Holosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia could be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and aterosclerosis of brain vessels were the most frequent causes of the syndrome.
The biologist noted that, to date, doctors do not know how to treat dementia effectively.
Prevention must therefore begin in time.
Foreign language learning and active communication, he said, would help to reduce the risk of dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic
"There are recommendations for the application of different BADs, but their effectiveness and relevance are still being debated in the scientific community," Goloshikin said.
"World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical stress, regularly training cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and thinking logic," Golosheykin said.
Previously, a British dementia charity stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people aged 40 years or older.
Medics called early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be seen as visual problems, which make the patient difficult to recognize objects.
Another sign of developing dementia was the aphasia, a condition where a person could not find the right words to convey what he wanted to say.
Neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili needs psycho-nerve treatment and rehabilitation abroad, told journalists neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical consilium established under the Georgian Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading in his disease.
The problems of movement, coordination, variability of character are stable problems," said the expert, noting that this is within the normative framework and that the ex-president now needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia," noted Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after he was disciplined by prison officers.
Georgian policy quickly succeeded in abolishing punishment and restoring its rights.

There were protests against COVID passports in Spain
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate were held in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, and is being transmitted by Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID passports became mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
Many demonstrators came to the action without masks.
On their poster, they accused the State of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment facilities and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this town claimed a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus have been detected since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
There are also plans to impose restrictions on non-vaccinated persons in Russia.
Bills on the unified QR code system were introduced by the Government to the State Duma on 12 November.
Russians are expected to be able to attend mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities with either a certificate of inoculation or post-inoculation or a medical discharge from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for the travel of trains and aircraft.

Cool Rise: How Chinese Become Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will bring together President Xi Jinping's 1 trillion Yuan, but will also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
Taivu ski resort in Zhangjiakaw, located near the venue of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greening works are also being carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to compete internationally.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakaw, there are snow problems.
The main long-term objective is to provide comfortable and interesting rest at Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, that is far from it.
Games adviser Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed to unrecognisable.
Each winter, an increasing number of Chinese travel to the slopes.
Fiona, the snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take years to create a ski culture here, according to Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and equipped with recreational infrastructure.
The 70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunley, near the venues of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that there has been a boom in winter sports tourism in recent years.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chunley, the express railway was held, and now no locals are unemployed.
There are an increasing number of shops in the country selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, the drinking points with the foods of the national kitchen are opened.
There's even a COVID-19 testing station on Taiwan now.
China seeks to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders of major international competitions, and resorts and equipment must reach world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, as stated at WHO
More than 500 million people in the world could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which had stalled human progress on universal access to health services, as stated at the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
On 12 December, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic had led to a breakdown in the provision of medical services and had caused undue stress in health systems.
Consequently, immunization coverage has declined for the first time in 10 years and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
WHO and WB stressed that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “to extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services from their own pockets”.
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people had little social support.

Reuters: The Taiwanese minister was disabled from broadcasting on the "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
Taiwan's Digital Minister Audrey Tan's speech at the panel discussion during the U.S.-sponsored "Summit for Democracy" was transferred to a videoless mode, testifying to the Summit's recording on YouTube.
Reuters' agency, citing sources, claims the picture was disabled at the White House's request.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was distinguished by a separate colour from the PRC, which considered the island to be its territory.
The map, which was shown by Ms. Tan, was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was identified as green as "free" and China, the DPRK, Laos and Vietnam as red as "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, the picture on her part was replaced by a screenshot with a note that the views of the discussants "do not necessarily express the position of the U.S. Government."
The PRC was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister could run counter to Washington's one-China policy.
A source of the agency stated that following the show of the map, the U.S. National Security Council had angryly contacted the State Department, accusing him of showing Taiwan to a single country.
The Washington Summit for Democracy was held from 9 to 10 December with the participation of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, editor-in-chief of the New Newspaper, Dmitry Muratov, called for the establishment of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today Deputy Secretary of the Sovbeza RF Yuri Averianov stated that the summit was carrying a "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

But what does that have to do with the number of children, the age, the pension fund and all that?
Write that they're "freaks, they didn't return the money."
And that's how many and when they have kids, it's none of your business until they get these kids to hang around your neck.
And since that's not possible, what right do you have to judge them?
It's probably just in education, so...

What if it involves other areas of life, litigation, etc.?

China strengthens prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities with land crossing points
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the Council of State of the PRC issued a circular to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in the cities where land crossing points are located, with a view to further preventing the entry of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving these cities are required to provide a negative test result for nucleic acids COVID-19 obtained within 48 hours prior to departure.
Those who arrive in cities where land crossing points are located must pass at least one test for nucleic acids COVID-19 upon arrival.

It is also noted that cities with land crossing points that meet certain conditions may consider establishing buffer zones to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on the "sad conclusion" between Russia and the United States.
The heads of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Ryabkov, in an interview with News, assessed the prospects of Moscow's relationship with Washington.
He noted that the long road of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not started yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improving relationships, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long journey that we have travelled with both the current administration and Trump and Obama.
Problems didn't start yesterday," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's desire to impose on Russia approaches on many questions.
The MFA's Zambias added that they would not risk optimistic projections of the prospects for improved relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, there had been no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the signals will be heard, and that Americans will heed the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, in a meeting with United States Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, stated that Moscow was ready to re-establish a dialogue with the United States.
Virusologist warned of the risk of vaccination with a COVID nasal drug outside hospitals
The nasal vaccine for COVID-19 may have allergies and will require medical help, so it is not appropriate to organize the first points to inject the drug at airports and shopping centres.
This was reported by TASS to the virologist, a Correspondant member of the RA, the laboratory of bio-nanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsi State University Sergei Netesov.
It's easier to set up nasal vaccination facilities at airports and malls, but I'd only do it at first resort in medical facilities.
The fact is, the possibility of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is low, but it is desirable that a person then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that operate in just a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it would be possible to think about vaccinations at malls when experience in the use of the drug was gained.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it was important that it hit a mucous shell in the nasal cavity.
However, it is likely that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the inducted nose is extinguished after injection.

Serbia produced 2 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine
Sputnik V is the most popular vaccine in Serbia.
Serbia produced about 2 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, and told TASS the Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of the country, Nenad Popović.
"The Torlac State Institute still produces about 2 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine, expecting a minimum of 4 million to be produced in the coming period," Popović noted.
He said that the Russian vaccine was the most popular among Serbs.
Accordingly, the Republic plans to purchase an additional million doses of vaccine from Russia.
The Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of Serbia also expressed an interest in the production of the Sputnik V nasal vaccine and Sputnik Light drug on the territory of the State.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin reported that the Russian Federation had delivered almost two million doses to Serbia of a domestic coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V.

The Benarti Prime Orto S1000 145x190 mattress.
Prime Orto S1000 matrix with different sides of hardness, total height of mattress 22 cm.
Maximum permissible load per sleeping place up to 150 kg.
The mattress is based on the independent spring block "S1000" (1,000 springs to one sleeping place).
Each spring is in a separate tissue karma, allowing springs to distribute the body load correctly.
For additional protection of the spring block, an insulation layer is added from the wolk separating mattress and spring fillings.
On the one side of the mattress is a layer of coconut coyre 3 cm high, which gives additional rigidity and durability to the mattress.
A layer of coconut coyre 3 cm and natural latex 1 cm is added on the opposite side of the mattress.
Natural latex has an anatomical effect and durable properties.
The mattress's cap is made of cotton giccard, propped on Holcon's environmentally pure material.
The tissue was treated with a special antibacterial impregnation Sanitized (Sweden).
The impregnation ensures the total destruction of mould fungi and prevents micro-organisms, dust mites and microbes from developing.
The mattress is equipped with four convenient handles for flipping as well as aerators for additional ventilation of the mattress layers.
The perimeter matrix is further reinforced by an artificial latex frame, which significantly increases its service life.

In the UK, 1,239 cases of coronavirus omicron staff in Russian were recorded in 24 hours.
In the UK, 1,239 cases of new coronavirus Omicron Stamm were detected in a 24-hour period.
Sky News informs you.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of a "micron" strain have been detected in England, 38 people have contracted a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people who contracted COVID-19 from the new strain in the UK reached 3,137.
Scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had previously calculated in pessimistic prediction that 75,000 people could die in England by April due to a coronavirus outbreak caused by the strain of the "omicron".
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
The spokesman for Russian President Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive action” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “invasion” of the country.
"Some restrictions to impose on Russia and not to suffer for yourself are impossible," said the Kremlin's official on Russia 1.
Peskov claims it's "undertaken by everyone in the world."
It has previously been reported that the US is considering introducing anti-Russian energy sanctions as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will be aimed at making it more difficult to convert rubles into dollars against Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, Herman Gref, is convinced that this is impossible.

New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported by French television channel BFM.TV on December 12.
Ninety-six.5 per cent of those who voted opposed independence.
3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results were cancelled by 2.99% of the ballots.
The voting rate on that day was very low: about 55 per cent of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the sites.
According to experts, the low turnout was due to separatist calls to withdraw from the referendum due to coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence had already been held in the region.
Most residents supported the presence of an archipelago within France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
Some 270,000 people live in the archipelago and the Territory has a special administrative and territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian Administration, under which the region may organize a vote on its independence twice every two years.

WHO provisionally considers "micron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously considered that “micron” is less dangerous than the coronavirus delta staff.
However, there is evidence of a decrease in vaccine efficiency in the new version COVID-19.
According to 9 December, “micron” is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and significantly modified antigen profile of the protein of the "omicron" strain suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the option.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it may be “heavy” (ed.) less severe than the delta, as stated in the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that, so far, all reported cases of “microne” infection in the EU have occurred easily or unsymptomly.
However, the new strain is reportedly spreading faster than the delta.
There have been two cases of Omicron Stamm infection in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," reported the Gamalea Center.
Rospornadzor's head Anna Popova has stated that there is no reliable evidence yet that the new version of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scripts for Green
The ex-deputate Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for developments for Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
In his view, the head of State could remain disassociated from the West and might also compromise on Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko spoke about this in a publication on the Glare portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called the "ideal storm", suggests that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
This development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"The prices of key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and power confrontations with key FPGs (financial and industrial groups. - Red.) are falling in parallel," added an ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario - "war against everyone."
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which Ukrainian authorities will face a number of challenges.
Because of this state of affairs, Ukraine's leadership may compromise on Donbass, which may lead to a domestic confrontation.
At the end of the summer, Green's position will be weakened, with the probability, according to the former nardep, of a situation of up to 50-55 per cent.
The third option in Ukrainian politics is to confront those who disagree with the Green Group and the President, which is likely to lead to the seizure of control of the power bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
In this scenario of crisis, Greensky will begin "reformatting power", added Denisenko.
Another scenario is the transformation of Green as the "father of the nation."
This could be the result of an event that would be a great shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to trigger a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such an option is possible as a result of natural disaster, technological disaster or aggressive action by Russia, and considers an ex-deputy.
However, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an “aggression” against Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that were increasing military activity at Russian borders.
Earlier, on 11 November, a survey of the sociological group Rating revealed that the Ukrainian president's ranking had fallen to a record low of 19.3 per cent.
This is the lowest since the election of its Head of State.
Analysts projected a situation in which, in the case of the next presidential election, only 21.8 per cent of the country's former President, Peter Poroshenko, would vote for Greensky, compared with 14.5 per cent for former President Peter Poroshenko.
However, only 19.3 per cent of all respondents expressed support for the President.

Arrested for an action in Red Square by a poet: "For a quote by Eutushenko 10 days, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for 10 days.
A BSE student was detained in Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #poeturassia's biggest poet was written.
This quote belongs to writer Eugenius Eutushenko.
A protocol was drawn up for Alexander on an administrative article on the repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public action.
He was first detained on 23 January in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexey Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now unfortunately the interest in it has been lost, to the decline of the culture of common in Russia, and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems online under this hashtag," Alexander explains.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal his message in more detail.
How have you been treated by the police this time and before?
What did the department ask you, how did they comment on your action?
This time the staff were more correct, the detention being as, polite as possible, as funny as that sounds in some context of the word.
On Pushkin, they took OMONovs and took them hard.
Asked in standard terms, about the motive.
When they heard, in principle, they looked if disapproved, they understood.
With the exception of the four sides of the monkey, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was going for.
And if, after the stock under this hashtag, they start writing their poems, at least a few people, I'll do it for 10 days.
According to protocol, at least speak the Tumba-yumba language in private.
And at public and official events, they speak the language around them so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on 25 September 2001, or in their mother tongue through an interpreter.
It's protocol and nothing else, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks beautiful Russian and still resorts to the assistance of an interpreter.
And there's an old-fashioned transcript at official events, and a stenographer doesn't have to know a few languages.
You don't want a lot of words, so say no!

Researchers described how potatoes help to combat age disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that improve circulation and reduce cholesterol levels.
The root fruit contains vitamins of Group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, foliar and pantotenic acids.
All of these elements help the system function.
In addition, potatoes help to combat age disorders.
Because of its large cell content, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and if used regularly, it can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the most benefit, root crops are better extinguished or boiled rather than roasted on oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, as did other products with a high glycemia rate.
These are carbohydrates that quickly burst into sugar, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian canteen potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in personal support farms and an increase in processing capacity.
In the view of market participants, only imports will be able to replace the product deficit for the time being.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm, and other pirates are removed from the issue of the Yandex
Candidates for departure
In 2015, rights holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate RuNet sites and most of them ceased to exist, says the director-general of the Internet Research Institute, Karen Kazarian.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - managed to survive, including the regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, the Lostfilm, which is available on both Yandex and Google's search engine, can be viewed as pirated copies of Netflix's "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" series directed by Anna Melikian, the original series of Russia's largest video service iv (enters AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available for the release of search engines, you can look at the animated novel Encanto, but judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screen (a pirate copy of the film shot in the cinema).
Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, features the series "University. 10 Years Later" of TNT (enters Gazprom Media).
Svetlana M., I'm sorry, but I wouldn't care if my son resents his mother or not.

Well, of course, that's rarely happening.

Russia is already hopelessly behind.
"This idea developed by the Poles" would be more likely to say that Poland has only changed the idea of 1776, but developed it quite effectively.
In fact, the slogan "Okraina - not Russia" appeared in 1848.
Which, by and large, doesn't make much difference.
I watched her interview, the girl said the biggest dream was that her wings would grow, her dad would always pull her off.

The wall lamp is Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
A wide circle surrounded by "molecules" of light provides as even and bright a light as possible.
"Atom" or "molecular" design that reflects the nature and nature of each subject does not lose relevance and allows for beneficial interior accents.
One characteristic of such lamps is the weightlessness of the structure.
The thin, virtually invisible ropes, which are adjustable in height, make it feel like the chandelier is floating in the air.
Metal gold fixtures and matto-white miniature placers will easily supplement any palette, and the suspension chandelier and bras presented in the collection will become the ready ensemble for the living room, bedroom, hallway lighting.
Well, it tastes good and it tastes good.
I really liked Tarhun, not the current one, of course.

Dimax Micro Ultimate, 160x190
Orthopaedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is comfortable with having two different softness surfaces – high hardness and a little more medium.
Only quality and bonus fillings that have proved to be exclusively on the best side of the product are included.
Springs: A block of independent "micropacket" springs has been installed in the centre of the model.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals in the sleeping space that work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that provides a unique point sub-structure.
Micropacket is the highest frequency of the whole variety of Dimax spring blocks, so it has a pronounced orthopaedic effect and is considered a premium.
Fillers: combinations of layers of coyra and natural latex are installed at the top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the stoves.
If there's a latex on one surface, the other one has a coconut coyre.
Such a tandem of fillers has long held the status of classical, as it conveys not only orthopaedic but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If the coyra provides the right back support, the latex provides an adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Chehol: The model is supplied in a simple tricotage covers by Aloe Vera.
If the client so wishes, he can be both filmed and fixed.
The total height of the article is 27 cm, and the recommended sleeping place load is 170 kg.
Guarantee and security: Guarantee period - 3 years.
The mattress received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopaedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will seek life in Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, and reported to the Active Camera on Sunday.
The purpose of the missions to begin in five years is to assess the suitability for life of the Venus clouds and then to search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists offered tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in Venus clouds.
So far, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, near the Earth of the planet, are too acid for life to exist there, but probably originally Venus was a planet of the Earth type.
A sample from Venus should arrive during the third mission.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question is whether it's earthlike or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that earth’s life has not begun on Earth.
If different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth, ” told the head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project, Michael Paúsala.

Metaves will change Russia's business
The subject of metaverses became popular in the fall of this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format for digital interaction between people.
Thus, business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in the creation of its own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metavoltaics should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend to create remote interactions in a pandemic is that people are tired of disunity and limitations.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of business's desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
With the third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when all rights, securities, works of art, and even money are digitized.
Anya, you're right, changing nutrition is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want anything too fat or too bad.
Of course, we're going to have a traditional olive party and a herring under the coat, but no one's making me eat at all.
You can eat on a spoon, try it, and that's enough.
After all, there are ten days of weekends ahead of you, and you can cook any delicious and useful dishes.
And how much hell work, time, money it took her to train.
And after doing five fourth jumps, she was left with no gold.
And she also realizes that four years until the next olympiad she won't stand, that is, she'll never be an Olympic champion.
And anyone who doesn't play sports or can't imagine all the circles of hell that it's gone through, don't go down with conviction.
The British economist was unable to provide a projection for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to provide a projection for 2022, as he believed such attempts would fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of uncertainty and that any trend may change turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic and, in second place, inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the rise in commodity prices was temporary or not.
According to a specialist, before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of infinite generosity of central banks had already outlived itself” and it was time to return to a relationship where inflation-adjusted interest rates would correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of a super-soft economic policy may, in the view of some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
Attention should also be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as to the increase in poverty and climate change, summarized by O'Neill.
Michael Shulgin, head of the Global Investment Research Division, had previously reported that the positive expectations of the dollar for 2022 remained, with less growth potential.
Among the risks to the dollar's exchange rate, Shulgin cited the Fed's monetary policy, oil price movements, and fears in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But the one thing that makes you happy is that when you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There's progress, just a sluggish one.
There is also a problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.
All the ecotaxies that take the waste out of the house.
It's a common place for recycling - it's used by marginalized people.
It's rare to bring glass and metal in there.

Russians gave road dealers about 4.5 per cent of the country's GDP
As a result of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion,784 billion roubles buying new cars, an increase of 28 per cent over the same period last year, as shown by the statistics of the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
In order to understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of heads of countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount was comparable to more than 4.5 per cent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Russian market is dominated by the Korean Kia brand in terms of income.
During the 10 months of this year, he managed to sell 325.7 billion roubles, almost 24 per cent more than a year earlier.
The related Kia mark of Hyundai has an even larger increase of over 35 per cent, and the proceeds from the sale of cars are estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
In the leading positions, this brand and the increase in the weighted average price of the car - in the year for Hyundai it rose by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely, and Mercedes-Benz had stronger appreciation dynamics.
However, sales from Korean brands have not increased so much: according to the statistics of the Motor Vehicle Producers Committee of the European Business Association in Russia, Kia sold 9.4 per cent more cars in the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota, which was used by Russians in 10 months, spent 275.5 billion rubles, which was 14 per cent more than the previous year.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with 266.1 billion roubles (+75 per cent) - the German premium brand has both increased sales (by 37 per cent) and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28 per cent, to 8.2 million roubles).
"Mercedes-Benz simultaneously have good sales growth and weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - hence greater financial capacity - explained NAPI CEO Tatiana Arabaji. -
The rate of sales growth shows fantastic Chinese brands, which also significantly increased the financial capacity this year."
Russian Lada shows average market performance (plus 28%) in terms of income growth, and Russians spent 229.4 billion roubles on cars in 10 months.
At the level of last year's financial capacity are companies whose car sales fell in 2021: in particular Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ, and minus, in 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand, up from 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto components and production interruptions covering the entire world autoprome, the auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same AutoWAZ increased the cost of the Lada models seven times a year, with the last cost (by 8 to 10,000 roubles) taking place at the end of November.
Regularly rewrite pricers for their products and other car manufacturers.
The Russian automobile market will continue to grow in monetary terms - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation makes its contribution to this, as well as the tendency of car concerns to play back past losses, experts consider.
In the face of a shortage of cars, I think that many cars have even been able to partly transfer to the consumer the costs of past periods that they could not put into the price of cars earlier,
Says the AfDB Capital analyst on Vladimir Bespalov's autoprochement.
I believe that in financial terms, car manufacturers are feeling very well now, supporting a high margin of sales."
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of increase in the price of cars, which was observed during 2021, and the price of new cars increases faster than inflation, the expert explains.
In the long run, the market will grow in both quantitative and monetary terms, but mainly through inflation and the complexity of the machinery itself, predict Besals.
As the supply increases, the opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, Russian authors will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the price of cars slows down, car manufacturers will be able to earn their income from the volume, as noted by the independent automobile consultant Sergei Burgosliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now seeking the most profit from each car sold, noting Burgosliyev.
Increases in machine production are not expected in at least the next six months, and in Russia the agitation is also fuelled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the market situation, cars have proved to be a good investment — a car purchased a year ago, even with a run, can now be sold more than the original cost, the expert notes.
Biden commented on the transfer of U.S. military to Ukraine in the event of Russia's invasion.
U.S. leadership has never considered sending American military to Ukraine in the event of Russia's "invasion".
United States President Joe Biden made such a statement.
"There have never been such plans," said the head of the White House, responding to a journalist's question as to whether the US had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the US and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine was not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the US would move forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9, all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, Russian President Dmitry Peskov's spokesman stressed that Moscow had no intention of invading Ukraine.
He pointed out, however, that Moscow saw the problem of the military use by Kiev of the drones supplied by Turkey, as well as the fact that “American armament is approaching our territory”.
I'm leaving this interview right away.
If they're trying to get me to listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an obscure burd, and wash a cup, it's scary to imagine what's going to happen at work.

If a fraud called from a number like this, like a "Ministry of Internal Affairs officer" or some other power structure, it's not efficient to drop it immediately, and it's likely not enough to blacklist it.
Because to confirm his lies about involvement in power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to scare and persuade.
More useful recommendations are needed for the people.
That's bullshit.
I can't believe it was like this.
They don't know who to blame anymore.
