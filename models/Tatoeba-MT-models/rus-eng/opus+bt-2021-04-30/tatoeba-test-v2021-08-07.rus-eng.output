White bread, please.
White pawn on f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black queen on h4-mat! In chess circles it's a joke they call "dirty mat".
White: rooks on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. Whites put the opponent in the position of tsugzwang, placing the rook on a6 followed by only two options: take the rook on a6 or move the elephant to any other diagonal field b8-h2. In the first case, whites move the pawn from b6 to b7 and put the mat; in the second case, white rook takes the black pawn on a7 with the same result.
