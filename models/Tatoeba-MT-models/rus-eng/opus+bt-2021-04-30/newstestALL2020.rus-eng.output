China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the Taipei Bill
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called Taipei Bill, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of the three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by the spokesman for the Office of the PRC State Council for Taiwan Affairs, Ma Xiaoguang.

China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone and by any force, emphasized Ma Xiaoguang.
TikTok hides inappropriate videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under 18 years of age
Imagine China / Reuters
The Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet's independence, or the banned Falun Gong religious group, tells The Guardian.
Documents at the disposal of the publication say that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) promotes China's foreign policy objectives abroad through the application.
Most of the violations related to China's policy fall under the heading of “hate incitement”.
In each case, TikTok places inappropriate publications in a context appropriate to general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general prohibition of “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on mentioning incidents in Tiananmen Square or genocide in Cambodia falls under the “distortion of the history of China or other countries”.
The document also contains a list of the prohibited names of twenty “foreign leaders or statesmen”, including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-eun, Indian politics Mahatmu Gandhi, American Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Premier Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Kyung-hee, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, and Indian Premier Narendra Modi, listed in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by social network administrators and may result in a user blocking.
Not very severe violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the website, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applied: "Now we use a localized approach as well as independent local professionals to upgrade."
Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on publications, and tells the co-founder of the Production Center, Rustem Bogdanov.
The Production Center is one Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the bloggers' promotional material "Producing Center" coordinates with the social media, but the user's material can be posted without agreement, hands over the Bogdans.
When asked whether TikTok can speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answers in the affirmative and says he has seen such publications.
Bogdanov is agreed by the founder of Our Digital Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for TikTok users list in the user agreement: you cannot lay out shocking content that discriminates against remarks and so on."
But any content that the moderators don't like can be dropped under these rules, celebrating Zaripov.
The Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under the age of 18.
According to the user agreement, only persons over the age of 13 can use TikTok.
Social network administrators test their age with artificial intelligence: neurosete analyzes faces and determines how many years a person looks, tells the Bogdans.
If the neurosets decide that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to BBC, in September 2019 ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the WeWork Coworking grounds.
The residents of Istanbul spoke about the earthquake in the city
A severe earthquake caused panic in Turkey's largest city
Last Thursday, September 26, a magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck Istanbul.
Thirty-four people were injured, 10 of whom are still in hospitals.
A resident of Istanbul, Melique, admitted to having a panic attack for the first time in her life.
"I cried so much.
She was crying right at work.
Later it got easier, I got back to business.
But I'm so ashamed now!" the girl told Channel 360.
"There was a really strong earthquake in Istanbul
I can't go back yet!
But generally, I'm fine," shared my impressions with political scientist Jaylan Ozgül.
Project manager Celine noted that the mayor of the city kept all the residents informed, but she said that citizens still felt small shocks of about 3.2 or 3.5 magnitude.
She also drew attention to the problem of communication immediately after the earthquake.
The lady said she couldn't reach her mother, but the Internet was working "excellently" and she could send a message through WhatsApp.
As kp.ru wrote, after the groundbreaking, all kindergartens and schools from which all students were evacuated were closed.
473 buildings were damaged.
The epic center of powerful underground shocks was recorded 68 kilometres west of Istanbul, in the Marble Sea.

I don't think anything's gone wrong in our relationship.
In Rosjnadzor, the results of an amputation test were reported to the child
A child in Rostov Oblast was amputated due to a medical error, and reports "The View" referring to the site of the territorial authority of Roscenadzor.
An 11-year-old boy broke his arm, after which he was cast in a hospital in the Zernograd district.
Some time later, the child developed gangrene, and was amputated.
The audit found that there had been irregularities in the timeliness and correctness of the diagnosis, as well as in the standard and volume of assistance provided.
The verification file has been transmitted to the S.U.S. of the Russian Federation for the region.
The URA.RU had previously reported that the head of the Southuralsk City Hospital had been arrested.
Russia has been warned of false calls from banks
In Russia, there has been an increase in calls from fraudsters who replace the bank's phone number.
This is reported by Commersant with reference to the Central Bank's data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator gave communications operators information about more than 2,500 numbers that had been called to clients of various financial organizations.
In 189 cases, the operators found a switch of number.
An additional 218 numbers have been blocked and 59 have imposed restrictions on the use of financial services.
Deputy head of the Information Security Department of the Central Bank, Artem Sychev, said that a wide range of Russian banks had encountered the change of number.
He explained that operators did not always respond to Central Bank warnings of fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such a duty in the Communications Act.
The Open Bank, Rosbanke and Alpha Bank confirmed an increase in the number-shifting fraudulent calls.
According to the Bilaina Press Service, some of the information on fraudulent calls that the CD provided was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are indeed used by banks to communicate with clients.
Their blocking would result in disruptions to the organization's work.
Artem Sychev told me that the Central Bank is planning to create a fraud database, which the communications operator will contact on each call to check the number.
He explained that such a framework would require legislative amendments.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership in the alliance in the fields of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
Gensek spoke of this during a performance at Columbia University in New York.
In response to a question as to whether the topic had been raised during the meeting, Stoltenberg said that they had indeed discussed the issue and stressed that Ukraine had not given a date for its accession to NATO in its reply.
He said that any country that wished to join the North Atlantic Alliance had to meet certain conditions to meet specific standards, writes RT.
Crimea offered a Green alternative to the NATO course
Ukraine’s President Vladimir Zelensky, instead of joining NATO, should pursue good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
On Friday, 27 September, the Co-President of the Assembly of the Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Chegrinets, reported on this.
"The President of Ukraine should not repeat his predecessor's mistakes, but should heed Donald Trump's advice to the [President of the United States], which he listened to with a sour face, and establish a relationship with the President of Russia," said Chegrinet to the journalists RIA News.
The Czech noted that Zelensky was a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian President would be able to remain in power only if relations with the Russian Federation were established.
Earlier on September 27, NATO Generalsack Jens Stoltenberg reported that he had had a conversation with Zelensky on the country's entry into the alliance.
To that end, he said, Ukraine had to meet certain conditions.
On 5 June, the MP welcomed Evgeny Balicki said that Ukraine's possible entry into the alliance did not guarantee a better life in the country.

Barcelona blackmails Neumar.
Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer, Neimar, are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the attacker's transfer to French Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost reached trial, but the Catalans offered the player a solution to the dispute without the intervention of Femida.
Otherwise, they refuse to return to him.
Neumar and his cunning father, who is also a Brazilian agent, had an interesting trick: under an agreement with Barsa, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward ended up in the SGC for a record 222 million euros.
Nevertheless, he received $22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
In addition, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payment.
When Neumar's claims were reported in the capital city of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
The Blue Granates insist that the bonus relied on the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was entitled to only a quarter of 40 million euros and is required to repay the proportional part of the first payment.
But the interesting thing is that in the summer, Neumar and Barsa almost agreed to bring back a bad player in Catalonia.
True, the deal failed, but the hope for a return forward remains.
And here, Sports.Ru reports referring to insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims is not resolved in a pre-trial manner, it would exclude the possibility of the Brazilian returning.
Naymar himself is so eager to return that he asked for assurances that the Catalans would buy him back.

At the same time, the Reform Party wanted to replace Janus Tamquivi with Andres Sutty.
But to that, Laar replied that the goal of the Reform Party was to gain two seats on the board of the Bank of Estonia - that, in addition to Janus Tamquivi, Andrés Sutty would also be on the board.

It is noted that a group of 15 representatives of the media received access to the fourth reactor management room of BSEC as part of the introduction of the guide to the exclusion zone.
According to Telegram Channel RT, journalists were there in special protective suits for less than five minutes, as the ruins of the destroyed power unit still drain radiation, 40,000 times the norm.
The accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant took place on the night of 26 April 1986.
Twelve regions in Ukraine and 23 per cent of the area of Belarus have been contaminated with radiation.
In Russia, 19 regions were affected.
Let us recall that in July of this year, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree that gave rise to a green corridor open to tourists in the Chernobyl zone.
The ban on filming has also been lifted in the exclusion zone.
It had previously been reported that the zone of alienation of BSEC on the Belarusian side had been opened to tourists.
Tour organizers stressed that less radiation could be produced in the area in a day than during flight by plane.

Which club will take Paul Mamayev, released on parole
Football player Pavel Mamayev, released from parole last week, will not return to Krasnodar Football Club.
A former quarterback for this club may shortly sign a contract with FC Rostov, the Champions portal reports.
According to the publication, negotiations between Rostov and Mamayev are now in their final stages.
The contract with a 31-year-old footballer is expected to be signed for two years, with the possibility of an extension for another season.
Sport Express writes that Pavel Mamayev was due to undergo a medical examination at Moscow's Dinamo the day before, but the check-up was not due to the "uncertain situation at the club."
Krasnodar terminated his contract with Mamayev last week under the agreement of the parties.
The quarterback has played for the Red-Dar club since 2014.
With the team, he won twice the Russian championship bronze.
Mamayev previously spoke for Moscow's Torpedo and CSKA.
From 2009 to 2016, Mamaev played for Russia with 15 matches.

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a cart found in a garbage pile.
A resident of the American city of Auckland Park, Florida, is arrested on charges of attempted murder after samurai swording his opponent in a dispute over a cart found in the trash.
The 54-year-old Curtis Miller dug into a pile of garbage near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers, who went out for an evening walk.
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the scum.
Miller saw Beavers' find and was upset.
He thought he could claim a cart because he was the first one to start digging in the trash.
The men started arguing.
Suddenly Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with it towards his home.
Miller then took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and pursued the opponent.
He caught up with Beavers at his house.
Miller took the sword out of the knife and started waving it towards the cart thief.
Beavers told Miller that what's going on is recorded on video.
Seeing the video camera, Miller escaped, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and walked into the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw a strange woman enter his yard and take the cart, shouting insults.
The police were already looking for Miller for driving without a license.
The man was arrested, charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, a hedge fund manager attacked a strange woman and wounded her with a sword.
He thus reacted that the guests at the wedding, which had been celebrated in the same hotel where he had stayed, had prevented him from smoking.
Mass riots on three.
The "Moskov case" against summer protestors the further away, the more visible it breaks down into separate pieces and loses political content.
The evidence of the “mass disorder” itself does not stand up to scrutiny, but in the absence of a political decision to slow down the case, a weak evidentiary basis would not necessarily have led to the dismissal of the charges.
The collapse of the case should inspire society, but it will certainly leave in extreme irritation the silos, whose efforts to fill the matter with figures and evidence have proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused in the case under article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disorder) - Alexey Miniylo was unexpectedly released from detention without any obligation, and a few hours later he was rehabilitated: the SCR dropped the charges against him.
Miniylo has been under arrest for almost two months, and has been supported by several professional associations: historians, priests, literaryists.
Afterwards, there were only two accused of rioting (the original accused were 13): Sergei Fomin, transferred to house arrest on 3 September, and Samariddin Rajabov, who had been arrested by the court the previous day until the end of December (he was also accused of using violence against a public official, art. 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court sentenced the author of the mock petition for Latvia's accession to the United States
The court of Vidzem suburb of Riga sentenced the author of a mock petition for Latvia's accession to the United States of America, Denis Bartetskom.
It is noted that the man was assigned 80 hours of corrective labour and one year of probation.
"The common sense is not the strongest part of our system," commented the Bartec judgment.
He also added that punishment is usually less than requested.
The collection of Latvia's accession signatures to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, along with this petition, the website collected signatures on Latvia's accession to the Galactic Empire and on the country's withdrawal from the Solar System and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case has been instituted against Bartecki under the first paragraph of the 82nd article of the Criminal Law of the country, “Purpose call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia”.
Prior to that, in 2016, the author of the Internet petition for Latvia's accession to Russia received six months of prison.
A Japanese airliner made an emergency landing in Khabarovsk
Boeing, who flew from Austria to Japan, made an emergency landing at Khabarovska Airport, reports TASS.
The aircraft belonging to the Japanese company ANA was manned by 206 people, including 12 crew members.
It is noted that there are no casualties.
The people from Tokyo were followed by another flight.

It was previously reported that an aircraft flying from Zhukovskiy Moscow Airport to Kyrgyzstan had made an emergency landing at Samara Airport due to a sick child on board.
The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs proposes to punish police officers on the Internet for insulting them.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation has prepared amendments to the Police Act to protect the security forces from the dissemination of defamatory and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, a motion for public discussion of the bill appeared on the Federal Regulatory Gateway, and the draft document has not yet been published.
The Explanatory Note to the document notes that it is being developed in order to protect the honour and dignity of a police officer from “distribution on information and communication networks, including the Internet, of information of a defamatory nature, including that of a discrediting nature”.
The exact manner in which police officers are to be protected from defamation online is not specified.
The explanation to the document states, however, that the provisions of the amendments will be applied “by individualizing the mechanism”, already pre-modified by the Act on the freezing of posts insulting representatives of the authorities and the Act on fines for such posts.
Both laws entered into force in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public debate and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the Explanatory Note, amendments to the Police Act are due to enter into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law to punish "clear disrespect for the state" on the Internet.
According to this document, Roscomnadzor warns the resource of the violation and gives it 24 hours to eliminate it.
The first violation of the prohibitions is punishable by a fine of between 30,000 and 300,000 roubles, and the second offence by administrative detention for up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roscomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslav edition 76.ru.
Shortly thereafter, the Chudov District Court of Novgorod Oblast fined a local resident with 30,000 roubles for posting "two records of information in indecent form which insults human dignity and public morality and expresses manifest disrespect for society, the State, the authorities exercising State authority in the Russian Federation".
Target date for the reduction of mortgage rates
Housing credit rates in Russia will decline until the end of 2019.
This was stated by Alexander Plutnik, CEO of the credit organization Dom.pf, and transmitted to Interfax.
As Plutnik pointed out at the Russian Minstroy College, most banks will have another mortgage rate reduction cycle in the remaining months of the year, and the market average will reach 8.9 per cent, the level envisaged by the national project “Housing and the Urban Environment”.
According to the project's passport, the average mortgage rate in 2019 should be 8.9 per cent, 2021 per cent 8.5 per cent and 2024 per cent 7.9 per cent.
The programme provides for “the provision of affordable housing for middle-income families, including the provision of opportunities for their acquisition (with a mortgage rate of less than 8 per cent)”.
Earlier in September, it was revealed that one of the largest players in the Russian mortgage market, Sberbank, was planning another reduction in housing credit rates before the end of the 2019s.
Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The subject of phytoandogens has been poorly studied.
Of the most famous, pine pollen.
Phytoestrogens, however, are well studied and have positive effects on the body.
They reduce the risks of certain diseases associated with age (circulatory, some cancers).
Known sources of phytoestrogens are all pulses (the most popular is soya), humbles, and flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such bads cannot be a full substitute for natural hormones.
The possible harm from such additives cannot be excluded.
For example, when they are received, the production of their own hormones may be reduced by the fact that there are too many external analogues in the body.
Vertennikov called for the revival of the Kazakh "Genice".
Former attacker Rotor and Russian team Oleg Veretennikov joined the revival of Kazakhstan's “Women”.
The Astana Club, which was called Dynamo, Celinnik, Astana and Genice at various times, was dissolved in 2014.
Vertennikov defended his colours in 2004 and 2008.
"I found out about the Renaissance Action of the Genice Football Club organized by his fans.
I couldn't stay away!
I spent a season and a half at this club.
These were not the best times in terms of results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal fans, who have always been with the team!
I'll always remember Moonightpasov Stadium, where I scored my 200th career ball!
The "genice" must be revived!
He's got a huge story and great fans.
I wish them all the best, and I believe the city's authorities will give them back their home club!" wrote the Vertennikov to Instagram.
The Bastion complex launched an Onx rocket on Chukock.
The DOD first launched a cruise missile from the Bastion complex on Chukotka.
The Onex started at a distance from the target of 350 kilometres, and 200 of them flew over land, a record for this type of missile.
Some 10 Pacific Navy warships and aircraft, as well as naval aircraft, provided security of the shooting, and reported to the FM Department of Information and Mass Communications.
Previously, Bastion complexes were never used on Chukotka.
Hydrometret Center named the right folk marks
In Russia, there are a lot of popular attitudes by which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometret Center checked all the signs that were allegedly working.
Meteorologists have come to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, though in a short time frame.
As the scientific leader of the Russian Hydrometre Centre, Roman Wilfand, said, if the sun is red during the sunset, the next day will indeed be a good day, as our ancestors have noticed.
And if the sky was white, then the rains would be the next day.
The second working mark is based on bird observation.
Most people talk about swallows, if they fly low, it's usually raining.
Explaining it is simple - when the humidity of the air is great, the mosculars wet their wings and the feathers have to decrease to hunt insects, writes TASS.
There are folk marks on different continents.
Groundhog Day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day you must watch the storm coming out of your hole to determine the time of spring.
Unidentified oil slicks were found on beaches in northeast Brazil
Oil slicks of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches in northeast Brazil.
The pollution was scattered over 2,000 kilometres of coastline.
Reports of the first oil slicks discovered began as early as September 2.
However, their number continued to increase every day until Thursday, as did territorial coverage.
The Brazilian Environment Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
Turns out they're all identical, and it's about crude oil.
The Petrobras State Petroleum Corporation, which was given samples to be analysed, stated that they were not of the same composition as oil extracted from the Brazilian territory.
"It's thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after the tanks have been cleared.
Many continue to do so.
And it most likely hit the ocean current," told the Brazilian news portal G1, coordinator of the Petroleum Workers Union of Pernambuco and Paraíba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country, environmentalists discovered nine sea turtles fully covered with oil film.
Only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute, together with Petrobras, will begin to clean up contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the institute’s specialists recommend that tourists and local residents bypass the oil slicks and alert all the contaminated sites found.
Medvedev commissioned a review of the standards of the catering industry.
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has instructed Rospornadzor, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Promtorg, together with the business ombudsman and the business community, to review sanitary and epidemiological rules and standards for catering organizations.
They will also have to study the transition to the application of the requirements of the Eurasian Economic Union regulations in food management.
The agency's proposals are due to be submitted to the Government no later than 15 October, as indicated in Mr. Medvedev's list of assignments following the 11 September “Dialog” programme on Russia 24.
By the same date, Mr. Medvedev instructed all the above-mentioned agencies, in addition to the Ministry of Justice, to submit proposals for the conduct of an experiment to limit control activities for community-based organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad Oblast, with effect from 1 January 2020.
The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have been tasked until 11 November with submitting to the Government a bill amending the COAP to apply an administrative suspension of activities for violation of the dietary requirements that have resulted in health injury.
In addition, the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Rospernadzor and the Ministry of Finance need to consider a gradual transition from 2021 to a consumer basket based on a basic set of foods that can form a full and healthy diet.
Let's remind you that the business community spoke of outdated requirements after one of the Anderson cafes was closed.
The business community demanded the repeal of the existing SanPinha, Rospornadzor announced a joint development of new ones.
There were 33 agencies on the list.
Meanwhile, Rospornadzor intends to reduce the number of sanitary standards and regulations by 40 times by 2021.
The operatives are currently in possession of information on three thefts involving the detainee.
He was employed by a man in the Skurat district of Tula.
He stole batteries and automagnets from cars.
Of the two vehicles, VAZ-2106 and VAZ-2107, the kidnapper took the batteries, presumably for further sale.
"And from another VAZ-2107 car for the same purpose, the perpetrator took the vehicle magnet and subvofer," reported to the UMDI for the Tula region.
The stolen intruder probably intended to resell.
A 26-year-old unemployed person is currently detained.
The Russians have nothing to save for their retirement — V. Matvienko
Federation Council Speaker Valentin Matvienko believes that Russians do not have enough savings to make the guaranteed pension product bill fully operational in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions through personal savings is quite common worldwide.
Another matter is how timely it is to introduce it.
"In my view, a large part of the population now has income, of which they simply have nothing to allocate to increasing pensions in the future," said V. Matvienko.
Russians, in the view of the speaker, are unable to understand the mechanisms for the formation and allocation of pensions, since “the constant changes in this area have completely confused them”.
That does not mean that I oppose the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we have to do everything we can to make sure that pensions, the social security of citizens improve.
But steps in this direction must be thoughtful, responsible, responsive to domestic realities," said V. Matvienko, "RIA News."
The Head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the guaranteed pension product bill) were to evolve, several basic principles must necessarily be included, including voluntaryness, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and State responsibility for safeguarding pension savings.
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced on 6 September that a draft law on the guaranteed pension product (SGP) would be sent for agreement.
Its main elements include a purely voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, guaranteeing the long-term pension savings of citizens by the State, the registration of citizens ' savings accounts by the central administrator, tax incentives for business and tax deductions for citizens.

It's a hero whose story affects all generations and audience around the world," says his press release.
In doing so, Faigi recalled that Sony was also creating his own kinslide, lined just around Spider-Man.
"It happened that he was the only superpowered hero to find himself in different movie universes.
So while Sony continues to develop his own Spady Universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he noted.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, obviously commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account a passage from Wolf from Wall Street, in which the hero Leonardo de Caprio shouts "I'm not leaving!"
Information on conflicts between companies appeared in August.
As reported by the media, Disney wanted half the cash proceeds from Spider-Man films, provided that both companies paid half the cost of producing the paintings.
But it didn't suit Sony.
The news of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from Kinsele Marvel sparked anger among many loyal fans.
Details of the new conditions are not yet disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but said, "We've been cooperating perfectly for the last four years, and our shared desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many fans [Man Spider].
We're glad we can go forward together."
The film Avengers: The Final, which brought together Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the most cashier in the history of world cinema, removing Avatar from first place.

Winnick became the only Ukrainian participant in the project.
The singer's press service had previously explained that the artist had participated in a project in support of the International Day of Peace, which was celebrated on 21 September, and had not changed his patriotic position.
Let's remind you, there's been a wave of outrage on the network.
The video itself is called mocking.
How can artists who have visited the occupied Crimea, who support Putin’s policy, who unleashed a war on Donbass, where people die almost every day, talk about peace?
Four people were convicted of a series of dach robberies in Khabarovsk
In Khabarovsk, the court sentenced four residents of the village of Friendship, who for two years had robbed a gift in the partnership “Cosmos” and “Raduga” in the Black River area.
On September 27, IA reports "Habarov Krai Today".
The criminal group included previously unconvicted men aged 31 and 37 and two brothers aged 21 and 24.
It was found that the perpetrator of the crime was the older of the brothers who had served in the juvenile colony when they were young.
He robbed nine houses alone, and the others later joined.
The damage to each of the thefts ranged from 3,000 to 21,000 rubles.
The criminals carried ovens, refrigerators, curtains, buckets, gas cylinders, chairs, tumbas, and many other items.
They were detained by a security alarm at the last house.

The second round is just a struggle, with halftime limited to 30 seconds.
Round three, everyone is allowed.
When's the first rule tournament you came up with?
November 29th.
In the undercard of our fight with the Cockleev.
But we don't know exactly how many battles we'll be fighting yet.

The Deputy Director of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Manish Kumar, reported on this at the V Jubilee Forum for Small and Medium-Sized Business in the SCO and BRICS regions.
It is important for us to learn from the SCO and BRICS countries, including Russia, a guest from Delhi.

As part of a working trip to Tobolsk, the governor of the Tymensk region, Alexander Moor, participated in the inauguration of the Sokolovsk water fence after the reconstruction.
It now has a capacity of 25,000 cubic metres per day.
The renovation of the water abstraction took place as part of the implementation of the Federal Clean Water Project on the National Ecology Project.

Wagai will expand water treatment plants
In Congress, Trump's conversation with Zelensky saw "Russian trail"
In the lower house of the United States Congress, the Russian Federation was accused of being involved in a scandal caused by a telephone conversation between White House head Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky.
The assumption that there might be "Russians" behind this story, made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, broadcasts MSNBC News.
"The Russians, I believe, put their hand on it," said the Democrat, but did not comment further.
Pelosi-led Democrats, who hold the majority in the House, had previously announced the launch of impeachment proceedings against the President.
It happened after Trump was complained to by an intelligence informant.
The informant suspected that, in a conversation with Zelensky in July, Trump had put pressure on his interviewee for Ukraine to file a case against the son of former Vice President Joseph Biden, with the latter likely to become Trump's electoral competitor in a year's time.
The White House had to provide congressmen and the public with a transcript of a scandalous conversation.

The expert told me why we should give up tea in bags.
A group of Canadian scientists from McGill University found that when a tea bag is made, more than ten billion microplastic particles enter the cup in five minutes.
Food safety expert Elizabeth Tikhonov said National News may also add sawdust particles to the packaged drink.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information about the composition of the bagged tea - the manufacturer may add ingredients that will not be listed on the package.
The sawdust do not throw away at the end of the season, so they may end up in tea.
"More than that, the bags don't always include tea plants," Tikhonova said.
She said that it would be better not to use such a drink in favour of tea on the floor, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of bagged tea was not only in composition but also in its method of production - microparticles were heated to high temperatures, so that they could release harmful substances.
"The best way to get clean green or black tea is to have the least additives in that drink," the expert pointed out.

Regions have been asked to share business support secrets
As the Parliamentary Gazette has become known, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy, Andrei Kutepov, sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development, Maxim Oreshkin, and the Minister of Finance, Anton Siluanov, inviting him to express his position on the initiatives of the constituent entities of the Federation to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It's time to build interregional linkages.
The Economic Policy Committee of the Federation Council summarized information from the regions on their business development and legalization programmes for self-employed persons, as well as the outcomes of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told senators about SME development issues and sent suggestions for improving existing legislation.
“To date, communication between regions has not been sufficiently developed, with the result that the business community in all regions has identified the lack of information on regional entrepreneurship development programmes throughout the country,” said Andrei Kutepov.
In an annex to the letter sent to the Government, he provided a compilation of regional positive developments in the legalization of self-employment and consolidated data from regions with proposals and issues (available for revision).
In addition to the relevant ministries, summary data from the regions were also sent to the heads of the regional executive authorities.
The exchange of information on good practices in the regions could stimulate the development of entrepreneurship in general.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," said the Senator of Parliament.
Useful experience
Today, support programmes for small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and are operating successfully in many regions of the country.
For example, the Vologda region has an Enterprise Support Centre which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in certification of finished products.
In Ivanov province, a business support system has been developed to implement the single-window principle through multifunctional centres.
In Krasnodar Province, grants are provided to start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives from the provincial budget.
The Orlov region has a cluster development centre.
The Amur region, within the framework of the federal project “Acceleration of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises”, provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators based on existing non-State co-working centres with federal funds.
In a number of other regions, special support measures are being implemented for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to be brought out of the shadows
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of legislative changes are needed to better support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Archangel region proposed replacing the term “self-employment” with “business activities”, as this “is most consistent with the content of public services to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In Ivanovsk province, amendments are considered necessary to expand the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including those for the finishing and repair of dwellings, home constructions and physical training classes.
The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control of malignant dairy producers through the Mercury veterinary system.
In the Kostrom and Magadana regions, the concept of “social entrepreneurship” and the support for social entrepreneurship are advocated in the legal and regulatory framework.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
“All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of public programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills”, Andrei Kutepov assured.
The airline helped passengers avoid neighborhoods with crying children
The Japan Airlines carrier (JAL) launched a new function: when booking seats on the plane, you can now find out where the small children will be seated.
Now, if you want to be next door, you can avoid them.
Japanese airline passengers Japan Airlines (JAL) were given the opportunity to take advantage of the new option and avoid unwanted neighborhoods with small children.
The air carrier launched a function that tracks where the children will be seated.
Passengers will be able to see the child's head on the spot when they choose seats in the passenger compartment during the ticket booking process, which are occupied by children between the ages of eight days and two years.
Thus, those who do not want to fly near the babies due to possible inconveniences associated with their crying can be located as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use airline services were thrilled with the innovation.
Some thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the users complained that he was flying from New York to Doha a few weeks ago, and there were three crying kids sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested the introduction of an "adult-only flight" expressing his willingness to pay extra for such a flight.
Many tourists noted that they would now always try to choose Japan Airlines for their movements, as they saw nothing pleasant about flying next to a crying child in a closed space.
Previously, a woman traveling with a baby tried to pick up her commuters on a Seoul-San Francisco flight.
She prepared candy bags for each of the 200 passengers, each of which contained an apology note.
Did the Oleg Tabakov train show up on the Metropolitan Metro?
If you are constantly using the Kaluzhko-Rizko Line (as most of the people of Konkov do), you will have a surprise.
A new theme train called "The Great Russian Artist Oleg Tabakov" was launched in the subway.
Every day, this name train carries 10,000 people.
He's on the orange line and he's talking about the director, actor and founder of the Tabakerk Theatre.
By the way, it is convenient to travel from Konkov to play plays that play on the new stage of the theatre (it is located in Little Suharev Square, near the Suharevskaya subway).
As we were explained in the Moscow Metro Press Service, "in the external design of the theme train, images of the stained glass of the new scene are used and the portraits of Oleg Tabakov are placed in the symbols he created in the theatre, film and cartoon."
The train tells of his family, a performance of "Matrossian Silence", from which the great life of the theatre began, the Tabakerk itself, and the filming work.
Rare archival images and film footage can be seen on the walls of the wagons.
Russian gays with adopted children sought asylum in the United States
A same-sex couple of Russians with two adopted children applied for asylum in the United States, hands over to RIA News.
The men reportedly left the Russian Federation for Ukraine, after which they went to the States where they applied for asylum.
According to Stimul, the family's reasons for such actions were “the continuing interest of law enforcement agencies”.
It is reported that men are not planning to return to Russia.
Children have been enrolled in American schools since the beginning of the school year and are adapting to the new conditions.
As will be recalled, it has previously been reported that a case has been brought against the social welfare officers of the Marjino district because of the adoption of two young boys by a same-sex family.
The HRC stated, however, that the raising of children by same-sex couples should not in itself be a cause of action.

Pavel Ustinov joined the pickets in support of the "Moscow case" figures.
Acter Pavel Ustinov joined a series of single pickets, Freedom All, which are held on Friday at the Russian President's office building in Old Square in Moscow, broadcast by the Interfax correspondent.
The picket series began on 18 September in support of Ustinov himself and has since continued every day.
At present, the participants in the action stand in succession, holding a poster with the inscription “Freedom for all” and the names of the convicts and arrested after the uncoordinated rallies in Moscow in the summer of 2019.
In addition to Ustinov, on the poster, the names of Egor Zhukov, Cyril Zhukov, Danil Begletz, Evgeny Kovalenko, Constantine Kotov, Ivan Podkopaev, Aydar Gubaydulina, Alexeya Miniylo, Sergei Fomin, Samariddin Rajabova, Nikita Chirtsov, Eduard of Petlyevsky, Vladislav Sinitsa.
On 16 September, the Tverskva Court sentenced 24-year-old Ustinov to 3.5 years of a general regime colony on charges of using violence against an OMON Rosg Guardi fighter at an uncoordinated 3 August action in the centre of Moscow (article 318, para. 2, of the Criminal Code).
On 20 September, at the request of the Office of the Attorney-General, the court changed Ustinov ' s detention measure from detention to a non-exit subscription.
Thus, the petition for the liberation of Ustinov received more than 112,000 signatures in 24 hours.
Theatre and film artists started a flash mob in support of a colleague.
A line was lined up in Old Square on 18 September to participate in a single picket in solidarity with the actor.
Human rights defenders, journalists, academics, teachers, doctors and Orthodox priests were required to review the case.
According to Interfax's sister Ustinov Yulia, at a rally on 29 September in the capital in support of the "Moscow case" figures, her brother does not plan to perform.
The "sanctions" deliveries to Russia fell 100 times.
The government of the Russian Federation has estimated that agricultural and food supplies to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo have declined more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, 31,000 tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries in the first half of 2019, compared with 3 million 442.2 thousand tons in the same period in 2013, reports Interfax.
However, the value of imported products declined to $226.5 million from $4 billion,975.5 million respectively.
These are shipments of goods that have not been embargoed.
As indicated in the report, volumes of prohibited imports were offset by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia and Serbia.
It should be recalled that at the end of August, the Government extended until 31 December 2020 the regulations for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited for entry into Russia as part of counter-sanctions.
The document posted on the official legal information portal noted that the rules had been extended for another year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
Originally, products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway, and Canada were subject to an order to destroy the sanction.
Later, from August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and from January 1, 2016 - Ukraine joined the list.
Putin's decree on the destruction of the “sanction” (food embargo products introduced by Moscow in response to Western anti-Russian sanctions) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has allowed the destruction of “sanctionary” food by any legal means.
As Western sanctions persist, the Russian Federation has also extended its response.
However, products imported for personal use by citizens are not covered by this measure.
The ban does not apply to the importation of goods for personal consumption of up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council of the President of the Russian Federation for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, Mikhail Fedotov, had previously called the “just immoral” destruction of food, and he said that this had a negative impact on the upbringing of people.
Moreover, Rospornadzor launched an initiative to ban the destruction of usable foods in early June.
The Human Rights Council of the President of the Russian Federation then made a similar recommendation to the Government.

According to ESO, the construction of the building's dome, where the E-ELT telescope (European Extreme Large Telescope) will be located, has officially commenced this week, so long as the most expensive and ambitious terrestrial astronomical project.
Its total value is estimated by ESO to exceed a billion euros.

The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record large mirror, with a diameter of about 39 meters.
It will be collected from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 metres.
This huge mirror, as well as two supporting reflecting surfaces of 4.2 and 3.75 meters in diameter, will help E-ELT to obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, as well as to search for Earth's doppelgangers.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Although construction of the dome has just begun, mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory, scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing for three years, since the announcement of the first plans to build the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose combined value was about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
