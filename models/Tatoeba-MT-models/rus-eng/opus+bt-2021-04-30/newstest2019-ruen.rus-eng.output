Number of Ukrainian recruits preparing to be sent to Donbass
The official spokesman for the People's Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LNR), Andrei Marochko, stated that Ukraine would send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbass in the winter of 2018-2019.
According to him, this is how Kiev plans to "want to complete the units somehow."
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve within the Ukrainian armed forces, mass dismissals have led to low unit staffing," Marochko said, quoted by RIA News.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainian recruits could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Forces (JSO).
This measure was expected to strengthen the role of Ukrainian sylvorics in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbass was exacerbated by the assassination of the head of the DNR, Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DNR authorities described what happened as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several persons involved in the bombing were detained.
According to preliminary reports, they confirmed that Ukrainian intelligence services had organized the diversion.

The head of the British MFA compared the EU to the Soviet Union and the prison.
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of captivating the member countries of the community.
The diplomat made such a statement at the convention of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, 30 September.
As Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to believing in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union kept no one from leaving it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from community to prison, the desire to leave it will not be reduced, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wishes to escape from captivity," said the minister.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to leave the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, noting the Gazette.ru.

In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue of the Irish border remains open.

Telegram users complained of a malfunction in the new version
iPhone users complained about problems in the Telegram Messenger's work after the September 28 update.
The user's phone number can be found on his username.
The complaints relate to gadgets with the relevant iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, when updated, the application shows a white screen or closes immediately.
Representatives of the Messinger reacted to the malfunction.
According to them, the problem may be the migration of information to a new application written in Swift.
Telegram temporarily suspended the automatic update of the application until the problem was resolved.
On 13 April, the Tagansk Court of Moscow granted Roscomnadzor's lawsuit to block the Messenger Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the telecommunications operators began to enforce the decision.
The reason was the Administration's refusal to provide the FSB with the key to deciphering correspondence needed to obtain terrorist data.
In August Telegram changed the privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a terrorist suspect to a user when receiving a court decision.
Telegram's audience decreased by 1.2 million after blocking in the Russian Federation.

They knew that Dinamo had a good win before we met, so they prepared very seriously.
It was important to drop out in most, I'm happy for the guys who went on a numerical advantage.
We've played well in most of these days, but we couldn't score.
At last, the red light at the gate lit.
We knew Minsk would come out loaded for the game, he'd try, that's what happened.
The game in most became the defining, winning goal we scored precisely in unequal compositions.
We managed to have a good third period today, even though we missed an early goal in this segment and it was clear that it would be difficult to do so in the future.
But we played very well in defense, didn't give much chance to the rival, didn't let us catch up on shifts, the Dinamo didn't have a numerical advantage attack, so it ended well for us, the words of Hartley's Omian club press service.

Elon Musk is forced to leave as head of the Tesla board.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla Elon Musk settled their dispute in the fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the network, as part of the agreements reached, Masku will have to leave as head of the Tesla board of directors.
In doing so, the commission allowed Mask to retain the position of head of Tesla.
It is noted that the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
The same amount will be recovered from Tesla.
In doing so, the money will be distributed to the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur who is listed as the 50 richest people on the planet by Forbes magazine.
He is the head of SpaceX Space Corporation, Neuralink Neurothecological Company and developer of Tesla electric carts, as well as co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had previously sued Tesla's CEO, Ilon Musk, because of his tweeted report about a possible buyout of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy out all shares on the stock market at a fixed price of $420.
The $420 stock value was allegedly established "because of the importance of this number in marijuana culture", previously reported by Bloomberg agency citing the co-director of the security department of the Steven Peikin Commission.
At the same time, Elon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy out the shares.
Commenting on a lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that he considered the fraud charges unfounded, and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not violate it in any way," said a businessman in an interview with CNBC.
In August, however, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective action against Mask, claiming financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had caused them losses.
In particular, one shareholder stated that the tweets of the businessman were misleading, forcing Tesla shareholders to purchase papers at artificially overpriced prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that Ilon Musk's careless remarks led to sharp fluctuations of course.
In September, Elon Musk accused the head of the research company Citron Research of trading.
Meanwhile, if Musk could not resolve his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would be in danger of being removed from the company's management and even prison.
This was said, inter alia, by former Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt to CNBC.
The mask is "a nice guy who can't run a car company."

In his words, now that "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage", renaming the church is like "Jews to wear a yellow six-point star" in fascist Germany.
"It means labeling the church as an enemy organization, and it was for that purpose that this bill was created," said a representative of the RPC on Russia 24.
The Metropolitan also stressed that the UPC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, because "the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country."

That's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the effectiveness of the Sochi Autodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
It'll be an extra tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitri Kozak did not pass and the main theme of the day for Russian auto-sports is the return of Daniel Kwat to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel together and wish him success next season,' said the vice-premier, "The News."

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked the beginning of the age of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming worldwide fame and made him a Nobel Prize winner.
By the way, the release of penicillin from moldy mushrooms wasn't Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, while cold, he planted slime from his own nose on Petri's cup (a glass roof in which bacteria are tested) and a few days later found that the bacteria there had been destroyed.
He also discovered penicillin almost by accident.
Fleming's name was listed on the list of the 100 most distinguished individuals in human history.
His discovery, according to many scholars, changed the course of history.
With penicillin, medicine began to deal with most of the oldest diseases previously considered incurable — tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming came to the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspapers wrote, "For the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than dozens of divisions."
Experts estimate that Fleming's discovery of the world's first antibiotics saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died in his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous Cathedral of St. Paul in London.

Trump talked about "love" at Kim Jong-eun.
From mutual cruelty, U.S. and DPRK leaders almost reached the point of falling in love with each other, joked Donald Trump.
US President Donald Trump noted a successful joke on his success on the North Korean crisis settlement front.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now corrected the relationship so much that they are almost in love with each other, as noted by the American President.
The White House owner recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as the main difficulty in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had so launched a relationship with the DPRK that they couldn't even reach the country's leaders - they just didn't pick up the phone.
At the time, the US and DPRK were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes "pretty letters" to the White House, noted Trump.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, he was also cruel to Kim Jong-un, which was, however, mutual.
But now their relationship has recovered so much that the leaders have fallen in love with each other.
In doing so, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the recent cessation of nuclear and missile tests by Pyongyang, as well as the closure of military testing sites.
All of this is due to the work of his administration, I'm sure the American president.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke flatteringly of Kim Jong Eun from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and the steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
Trump noted, however, that sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the Korean peninsula was fully denuclearized.

A positive outcome of the meeting was the cessation of the nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
At the same time, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still piling up.

Nice called for the "Moscow language to be replaced by Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children's writer and mother tongue advocate Laris Nice called for the "Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language" to be removed from Ukraine.
To do so, she offers the Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural offensive".
Nitsoy shared her ideas on “the desirability of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian publication Monitor.
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product was being prepared - it was already in existence and was continuing to develop.
In time, Ukrainians "will recover" from this "Moscow language," she is convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said that Russian language had previously been widely used on television and radio, but that there was little left in public space.
However, according to Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language are, in her view, only “extension of borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Nichoi had previously shared her experience of maintaining a “Ukrainian-speaking regime” at a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she had been invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with a network of Watsons bookshops, one of which had been talking to her in Russian.
After not achieving her, Nice threw a change at the girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians she calls "language schizophrenia", encouraging Ukrainians to give up Russian letters even in the writing of surnames.
Nice recently stated that the name "Rouse" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service could not avoid the writer's anger: by coming in there and hearing staff talk to each other in Russian, she started a scandal and left by slamming the door.

"It was such a complex game, and during the break, they had a serious male conversation, and it brought fruit: they scored two balls and didn't miss.
"You missed a few matches because of the damage you sustained at the beginning of the month.
How did it feel today?"
"If it took 90 minutes, everything's fine!
I actually felt good.
Maybe there's a little bit of strength at the end, so nothing happens.
And so, the doctors and physical therapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which they are very grateful!
"What do you think of the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after winning and recovering, it's easier, and the mood in the collective is good.
Now we've got a white streak, though it was black at first.
We need to keep this up and cheer the fans."
"Have you missed the game in the time you didn't go to the field?"
"There's this, a little bored, 'cause it's really a bad situation.
But again, thanks to the physical therapist and the doctors for putting them on their feet.
Most importantly, we won and cheered the fans.
And the rest is secondary."

Citizens in the Sunday referendum are asked to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece?"
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav Republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.

The prosecution for the Dagestan MP has become news.
The Mahachkala Soviet District Court detained Dagestan Rajab Abdulatipov, a member of the People's Assembly, for two months, suspected of involvement in a criminal association that processed a disability for bribes.
"I" became aware of the details of the investigation, which shed light on how, according to the Russian Investigation Committee, the younger brother of former head of the Republic, Ramazan Abdulatipov, Rajab Abdulatipov, had contributed to criminal acts now by former head of the Chief Medical and Social Expertise Bureau, Mohammed Mahachev, and his accomplices.
Among other things, in the course of the intelligence activities carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was found that Rajab Abdulatipov had lobbied for the appointment of Mohammed Mahachev as head of the office, allegedly receiving 70 million rubles for this purpose.
In the past, the investigation of Mohammed Mahachev, other heads and staff of the local medical and social experts under his supervision, initiated criminal proceedings under article 210 (establishment of and participation in a criminal association using official position), article 290 (receipt of bribe by an organized group), article 292 (service fraud) and article 159 (fraud of a particularly large scale) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
According to the investigation, at the end of 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, aware of the illegal actions of Mohammed Mahachev and his collaborators involved in the theft of Pension Fund funds, joined their activities by joining a criminal association.
As head of the administration of the Federal Migration Service of the Russian Federation for Dagestan, and having links in State authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as having a related relationship with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatips, investigators consider that “ensure the activities of other members of the criminal association, establish contacts with State officials to support the illegal activities of Mohammed Mahachev and his position as head of the federal capital “Chief Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise for the Republic of Dagestan” have organized the illegal identification of persons with disabilities”.
Following the announcement of this information at the Soviet District Court on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov rejected the charges against him.
"Of course, everything I'm being charged with today is new to me, I'm not familiar with it," he said.
The court did not arrest a deputy from “Single Russia” for 10 days before the indictment, as was the case with previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but for two months immediately, since article 210 of the Criminal Code appeared in his case.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is much longer time to bring charges, up to 45 days from the moment of detention.

The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs, Constantine Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it will be a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral part of the solution of global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the present 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years with regard to Russia has now been in order to be more muted," said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Rossian newspaper.
He explained that, in previous years, the Russian Federation had sometimes “identified as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with Ebola fever, climate change or terrorism, Russia was in that series, at least in the statement of a group of Western countries, which had spoken with some consensus on the matter”.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "the Russian theme in the negative was virtually absent."
"If the US President, the President of France, the German Foreign Minister's statement, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at any rate the choir was not exactly accurate," noted the politician, noting that Russia was "no longer a wall about which the tennis ball is trained."
The head of the substantive committee of Sovfed does not exclude that this indicates a trend which he believes "will single out the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may become fully apparent in a year, two or three".
"I do not rule out that this session may in some sense be a turning point," said Kosachev, explaining that "too many examples of how Russia's involvement manages to move forward in international affairs."
He gave an example of the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Until this is unfortunately not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be needed over time," added parliamentarians.
This is because he believes that there is an “adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just a possible, integral participant in solving the global problems of the modern world”.
"I don't want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling we're somewhere passing a point beyond which the movement will no longer be a reversal, it will be a movement forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context was Kosachev's "request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I have attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I have held my own meetings, and I have been very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago Russia's view, Russia's vision of what is happening in the world, was largely uninterested, the situation is different now," said the Chairman of the Sovfed Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order that represents the West has no answers to the questions of how to solve world problems because of the apparent lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to address the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of nuclear non-proliferation, and the problems of migration”.
"And here the request for Russian vision is becoming more and more apparent," expressed Kosachev's confidence, stressing that in this sense he considered "the current session to be a success for the Russian delegation's work, a success for Russia."
Orphankin finished last at the Russian Grand Prix "Formula One"
That's a great result for Max.
Considering he started from 19th position!
It's like a birthday party.
The Dutchman's upset, though.
And we congratulate Hamilton.
His separation from Fettel increased by 50 points.
Bottas is on the side looking angry, I guess.
In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that military force will not be used in the Syrian province of Idlib, as stated by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem.
However, he said, Syria had a right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had the opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the withdrawal of militants from the Idlib demilitarized zone of the Jebhat al-Nusra organization banned in Russia, as reported by RIA News.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of Euphrates if the Kurds sought separatism.
At the same time, Muallem believes that negotiations with Kurdish SDF forces were good until interrupted by the US.
On 17 September, Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdoğan agreed to establish by 15 October a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government troops in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led Chelsea Youth Team.
It was previously reported that a 37-year-old defender had negotiated a transition to the Moscow Spartak.
According to RT citing Mirror, former England captain John Terry led Chelsea's youth team.
According to the source, a well-known player who has long been a member of the London club will run the team no more than 23 years old.
It is noted that at the coaching staff, Terry will replace Jody Morris, who left for Derby County.
Remember, in September, Terry was close to moving to Moscow's Spartacus, but eventually abandoned the idea after talking to his family.
The first vice-speaker of Verkhovna Rada, Irina Geravenko, apologized to the Russian Federation for the "spionage" of Ukrainian journalist Roman Sušchenko for not having been able to release him from the jails so far.
She said this in a video address to a political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko by the FSB.
She said that an action was taking place under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris these days, in which the participants launched a hunger protest demanding the release of the Kremlin's prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, among them are people who know you well, starve to support Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiation, no interview where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, have demanded no pressure on the Kremlin, no pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those children who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea," Geravenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the trials would heal every Ukrainian by making us “worst, tougher in defending Ukraine's national interests, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what good and what evil is”.
Let us recall that Ukrinfora correspondent in France, Roman Sušchenko, was detained by Russian silos on 30 September 2016 at Moscow Airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with espionage with the General Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sušchenko to 12 years of maximum-security colony, and the Russian Supreme Court declared the verdict legal.
Russian jailers granted the Ukrainian's last request before he was transferred to the colony.
NASA reported an asteroid the size of Big Ben approaching Earth.
The American Space Agency NASA reported that a major SP1 asteroid could reach the Earth with a length of up to 160 m.
According to Daily Express, a space object may exceed the height of the famous Big Ben or London Wheel of View by length.
However, precise data on its size are not yet available.
The speed at which SP1 moves is about 60,000 km/h. The lowest distance between the asteroid and Earth will be October 3.
Then it will pass by our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
The asteroid first spotted September 19.
NASA listed it as near-Earth objects.
Previously, on September 27, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency published the first ever video from the surface of the asteroid Ryuga.
Two Japanese rovers (planetarys) launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe were able to obtain unique footage.
Baste has been credited with the abuse of the FM-2018 stadium football lawn.
The damage to the football lawn at the stadium in Rostov-on-Donu was linked to the concert of Russian rapper Vasily Vakulenko, or Basta.
Photo published in Instagram account hd7tv.

The comments claim that grass at the edge of the field was damaged by the protective coating (special tiles).
The concert, scheduled for 29 September, was never cancelled.
The Rostov Football Club, as well as the Russian Premier League, opposed the concert.
"I want to know the names of those football players and Rostov representatives who claim that my performance can damage, hinder the activities and development of the football club, and affect the performance of his players," Basta wrote in response to criticism.
Rostov Arena is one of the stadiums of the 2018 World Cup.

Wahtang Kikabidze on cancer control
Many artists are now talking about how they managed to cope with cancer.
Unfortunately, the disease spares no one, and the stories of popular people about winning cancer give hope to many patients.
Famous actor Wahtang Kikabidze admitted to being alive only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a sentence.
"I feel like I've been hit with a hammer from the bottom of my skull.
I fell.
He's lost his orientation.
They put it in the hospital.
I couldn't hold a spoon, I couldn't stand, I fell all the time.
Started running tests, turned out to be bad, and the artery doesn't bleed.
They brought me to Moscow, they said I had a large pus cyst in my head, and they had an emergency surgery.
And during the surgery, doctors saw a tumor behind the brush," told Kikabidze in "One Day."
The tumor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol on the threshold of his house.
But the actor's wife wouldn't let her bury a living actor, she believed holyly that she could handle the illness and had not left her beloved husband's bed for more than a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Every time I had a critical situation, she was like a rock," the actor confessed.
The actor managed to cope with the disease, now living happily in his home in downtown Tbilisi.
And from time to time, he refutes the rumours of his illness, the untimely passing, which all the time appears on the Net.
The creators of the Peacemaker site added Peter Sillarto, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, to the section “Purgatory”.
The reason was “an attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of neighbouring countries has been found to be “direct threats of invasion of Ukraine” and “support for separatist sentiments in Ukraine”, as well as to participate “in organizing provocation aimed at the mass violation by Ukrainian citizens of Ukrainian legislation”.
Note that in front of the Sillarto in Purgatory, Deputy Kievo-Pecherskaya Pavel and the predecessor of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriart) Onufriy were pleased.
The reason was their opposition to the acquisition of Tomos by the Ukrainian Local Church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatya, Ukrainian President Peter Poroshenko demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.
The authorities named the sum of the "gold parachute" of the crow's governor.
A one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronezh region, Yuri Aguibalov, was made under the Regional Public Service Act.
At the same time, the real amount of the gold parachute of the vacated Vrio official was several times less than the amount expressed in the media.
Such explanations were provided to the regional government press service.
According to the law, Aguigalova has a salary of 11,189 roubles.
Thus, it was emphasized in the press service that the lump sum was 223,892 roubles less income tax, rather than the 1 million rubles that the media had written about.
The official received an old-age insurance pension from July 2018.
He has served for more than nine years in public office.
He is granted this pension and a lump-sum payment as soon as he is dismissed from office, and was explained to the RIA News Agency in the regional government.
However, Aguibalov ' s pension supplement was suspended when he was appointed to public office, and his salary remained the same as in the previous period.
The winner of the governor's election, Vrio, the governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, took office on 15 September.
Aguibalova was relieved of his post due to the expiry of the term of office of the Vrio of the head of the region.
Similarly, the powers of other officials who held public office in the region have ended.
On 29 September, Telegram Channel Nezygary published documents indicating that Aguigalowa, who had resigned as lieutenant governor, had paid a termination indemnity of 23 salaries, and that two days later he had again received a similar position without a Vrio app.
The State's deputy called for students to be told about the harm of masturbation.
Onishchenko holds the post of First Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on his experience, he pointed out in an interview that teenagers are provoking harmful information that they find on the Internet to masturbate.
It is worth fighting at the level of educational institutions and family, and the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, Member of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with Radio "Speaking Moscow":
As part of the general sex education of children, this should be done by explaining the harm because there is a risk to the sexual health of the child, both male and female.
The problem is objective, it is that the maturity of children is early enough, and there are further large scissors between their sexual maturity and the ability to formally enter into contact between the sexes.
According to Onishchenko, the problem is hampered by “hypotheism”, silence about “the problem of sexual age” and lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers are facing onyism.
The MP believes that teaching lessons about the harm of Onanism is primarily in schools in the “hyperurbanized” regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we'll just not understand, to say the least," the professor said.
Gennady Onishchenko is an active academic of RANM, a member of the RANM Presidium, a doctorate in medical sciences, a professor.
Earned doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, member of the Presidium of the Russian-wide public organization Health League of the Nation.
The families of the dead in Izmajlovsky will help "Technetics"
The Heatnet will provide assistance to the families of the victims when the pipe breaks out on the Izmilov Avenue.
Relatives were told about this at the company immediately after the tragedy.
Let us recall that the pipe broke into the yard of the house on Izmajlov Avenue on 28 September.
As a result of the tragedy, several cars fell under the asphalt, and two young people died locally from burns.
The Adg was the second most popular in Germany.
An anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats another popularity record, and Angel Merkel's ratings fall.
It appears that the German people have become seriously tired of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which has made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most notably, recent questions suggest that the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany is becoming more popular and that the positions of the ruling bloc Merkel and Zeehofer are weakening.
This week, the ADG broke another record, peaking at number two in the popular sympathies ranking.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
A one percentage point gap can be deduced as statistical error, but one cannot fail to note the fact that the ADG, created in 2013 from a small group of Euroceptic economists, has become a major political force.
For the time being, the leadership continues to hold the ruling HSS/HDS bloc, which has about 30 per cent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - as early as April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal ranking of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans are supporting Angela Merkel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
Add that the Social Democrats were followed by green (15 per cent), left (11 per cent) and liberals (10 per cent).
Evolution of Alternatives
The Alternative for Germany Party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The Group had initially been in opposition to the Government's policy, but had initially dealt only with economic issues, including the euro and EU interaction.
In doing so, the group opposed Germany's “scanning” of weak EU economies, and did not exclude the possibility of returning to the German mark and the country's complete withdrawal from the European Union.
Against the background of a deepening immigration crisis, the political platform of the ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that took over the niche of Euroskeptics and began to strongly criticize the government for failing immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary election in 2017, the AdG managed to make it to the Bundestag for the first time with 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of Alternatives for Germany have won seats in the European Parliament.
A video was published of a journalist calling Ukrainian citizens a "nation of fools"
The host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books, Ostop Drozdov, admitted live that he considered his compatriots a "nation of fools".
They believe in TV and don't read much.
As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We have not been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood," the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov's words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Television and Radio Broadcasting Committee of Necessary has begun to fight against literature that has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the importation of even 201 publications.
Manchester City beat Brighton and made APL leaders.

Canadians created a car for the apocalypse, a magazine behind the wheel.
Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Rochel Defence Solutions has stated that it already accepts requests for its new armored car.
Rochel Senator APC Apocalypse Armor
On the subject of the apocalypse, it is not only video game manufacturers, film studios, and book publishers that make money.
Now the automobile companies are also developing a new niche for themselves.
For example, Canadian Rochel Defence Solutions introduced its Apocalypse APC Senator armor.
In a fantasy-free time, this company's engineers make armoured vehicles for the police.
The Rochel Senator APC is designed to accommodate 12 passengers who are uncomfortably but in complete safety are placed in a intact armourcapsule.
This bunker, or else you can't call the design, because its reservation level is B7, set on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, can protect the capsule from grenade and anti-personnel mine explosions.
Rochel Senator APC Armoured Armoured Apocalypse Salmon
In order to prevent passengers from being harmed even by an explosive wave from a shell that exploded next to the vehicle, the car's cabin is equipped with special amortizing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
For safe view, the Rochel Senator APC is equipped with a circular viewing camera system with night vision functions as well as an observation armored tower on the roof.
There's no weapons in the car.
Front portion of the Apocalypse Armoured Armoured Car Rosel Senator APC
To ensure that the weight of the armoured vehicle does not affect its mobility, the Rochel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-strong 6.7-litre endurance turbodiesel engine, the full power of which is transmitted to the four wheels of the armory through a 6-speed automatic gearbox.
There's no chance of getting completely stuck in the Apocalypse armory of the Rochel Senator APC.
To see the Apocalypse armor of the Rochel Senator APC will be available at a specialized exhibition in Washington, D.C., in October.
The time of death of the universe is set.
The universe will last approximately 140 billion years, ten times the age of the observed world, about 13.8 billion years.
A study of an international team of scientists is posted in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and directed to publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Similar conclusions were reached by experts watching with the HSC (Hyper Superime-Cam) camera of Subaru telescope over about ten million galaxies.
After tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 per cent of the world's observed energy masses, scientists, working under the standard cosmological model →CDM (→ Cold Dark Matter), appreciated the pace of expansion of the universe, which was a little slower than previously thought.
A press release from Subaru Observatory notes that observations have provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the recording of data from the European Space Telescope Planck has clarified the limitations imposed on the parameters of ←CDM.
In July, scientists modeled the possible destruction of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments to the effect that the world under observation would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Divide.
Another attempt to bring together the proponents of the pension referendum failed.
An opportunity to learn the views of the people on pension reform is postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the general federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that recorded different wordings of the questions (the total number of terms recorded by the Centrezibrick was five).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians, "Do you want to ensure that the retirement pension legislation as of 1 July 2018 does not raise the age at which Russian citizens are entitled to an old-age pension?"
This language was registered by the Vology Sub-group, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered to be the simplest and most legally comprehensive.
Most of the participants in the meeting were supporters of the Fair Russia member Ilya Swiridov (six subgroups) and the CRC (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Swiridov had previously told Vedomos that invitations had been sent to all initiators and some 40 subgroups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, the head of the water subgroup (its wording was supported by another 15 subgroups), said to Vedomosti, that she had not received an invitation or planned to come: "We did not understand who the friend was and who the enemy was."
The blues singer Otis Rush died.
At the age of 84, a prominent Chicago blues guitarist and singer, Otis Rush, died, reporting AP citing his manager, Rick Bates.
He died as a result of complications following a stroke in 2003.
Mr. Rush's work influenced musicians such as Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton.
He was widely known in 1956 after the release of the song "I Can't Quit You Baby", which peaked at number six on the Billboard R&B ranking.
Admiral's caused us a lot of trouble.
Zinetula Bilaledin: "Admiral" caused us great trouble
The head coach of Ak Bars, Zinetul Bilaletdinov, summarized the outcome of the regular KHL championship against Admiral (4:2).
"It wasn't easy playing, it was complicated.
The rival fought with dignity, caused us great trouble.
Glad we played well today in most.
I've already told you that goals will come someday, the important thing is that we work on it.
And that we won is also very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripov a break in this series?"
"We have our own program he works on.
That's why it was a decision," quotes Bilyaletdin's press service of the club.
Elon Musk will be leaving as head of the Tesla board.
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk will have to leave as chairman of the board of directors of Tesla and pay a $20 million fine.
In doing so, the businessman will retain the position of CEO of the company, reports AFP with reference to the regulator's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a $20 million fine.
The regulator had previously sued Ilon Musk - officials thought he had misled Tesla investors as the businessman had allowed all the company's shares to be purchased at a high price of $420 per paper.
In the Loko match, Achmat, Turbin's mistakes were sprung like a horn of plenty.
Former Union-wide judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of Arbitrator Evgeny Turbin in the 9th round of Russia's Locomotive–Ahmat Championship and dismantled controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate Evgeny Turbin's judgment in the Locomotive–Ahmat match?
- I believe this arbiter has confirmed his inability to judge Russian Premier League matches.
It surprises me that the pressure in the meeting of the fifth round of Spartacus - Dinamo, neither Turbin himself nor the DSI executives made serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private absenteeisms of gross receptions were sprung from the horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute, railman Eder is slammed with his hands in his penalty square by Akhmat Rodolfo's defender.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't make a penalty.
- How do you rate the episode involving Idova, who was in the 82nd minute when he thought the ball hit his arm?
- I believe there was a deliberate game with the protector's hand in his penalty square.
Turbin was next to the moment, well sees the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This point was also to be seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
Nevertheless, all three were asleep, and no penalty was imposed.
So the score in the match was distorted, and sports justice was broken.
This was the very case in which judgment on concepts displaced and buried the sports spirit of the game.
In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest defender, who broke the rules in the fight against the Crimea, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he applauded him with a demonstration.
What do you think of this episode?
Should I have shown you the second Gorchinik?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card didn't exactly show up on the case.
The second would be illogical.
Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of judgeship that some teams were being punished for violations such as the Idova episode, and some of them weren't.
What does a footballer say?
- Depends on what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give it.
So the referee doesn't give a second penalty to the opposite gate.
That's the principle that's being used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge is watching who's playing.
Locomotive played on Saturday and Achmat has serious complaints about Turbin's work because the team was compromised.
Matt Damon played the rape defendant Judge Cavanaugh on SNL's launch.
American actor Matt Damon played U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, who is charged with rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new Saturday Night Live season on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Cavanaugh at a Senate hearing on the rape charge.
The U.S. Supreme Court candidate had previously drawn attention to his emotional and detailed stories in an interview with Senator Amy Clobushar.
For example, Cavanaugh repeatedly confessed to his love of beer, but stated that he had never been drunk until he was unconscious.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on the charge of rape, Cavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
Those moments also beat Damon.
All I did was drink a lot and not think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, most drunk virgin anyone's ever seen.
Everyone knows that," said the judge in the execution of Matt Damon.
Cavanaugh had previously been elected supreme judge of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found her cloned dogs strange in behavior.
American singer Barbra Streisand stated that the clones of her dead dog behave in a completely different way than the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul," stressed a 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old cat-de-tulear dog named Samantha, who had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a dog of Chihuahua breed called Miracle Milley, which was named the smallest dog in the world, had been cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The US is thinking about Russia's naval blockade over oil and gas supplies.
In the US, the US could launch a naval blockade against Russia to gain a world energy market advantage.
The United States authorities have so enthusiastically fought for success in the world’s hydrocarbon market that they are prepared to resort to the naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world’s main suppliers of energy.
Ryan Zinke, head of the U.S. Department of Internal Affairs, spoke about the possibility of a naval blockade the previous day.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior did not carry out police functions, but performed civilian functions, including natural resource policies.
Therefore, Zinke's statement came within the purview of his agency, although it was not devoid of political colour.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zink stated that thanks to the US Navy, maritime routes in the Middle East region are controlled and can block them if necessary.
Zinke's words suggested that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continues to receive the lion's share of its revenues from oil and gas supplies to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, just as in Eastern Europe, was the main motive for Moscow’s revitalization in the region, I am sure Zinke.
The minister made it clear that the US still expects to lead the world energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push Russia and Iran, and the sea blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.

Medicalians in the island region call on residents to be more active and not to ignore the recommendations of doctors.
This year, 219,000 people in the region are to be vaccinated, including at least 70 per cent of all children.
To date, 49,000 Sahelians and smokers have been vaccinated.
At the South Sahalin children’s health centre, more than 10,000 visitors attended the procedure.
According to medical experts, children from six months of age, transport workers, educational and health personnel and those who are more likely to be in contact with a large number of people are at greater risk of being “captured” by children.
All of them can get a free flu shot.
Nor do people with chronic diseases, pregnant women, and students pay for injections.

Supersonic passenger aircraft in the Russian Federation will be placed in serial production
Serial production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was announced by the Director General of the Zhukovsky Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute, Cyril Sipalo.
He said that the scientific centre was working on supersonic issues both in international consortia and in cooperation with the Minpromtorg.
"We feel it'll take us two or three years to get a technology demonstrationer, as well as another 10 to 15 years to get a serial machine to transport across our homeland," added Sipalo.
He clarified that the question now before Russian experts was how to make technology cost-effective and safe at the same time.
In early September, PAO aircraft developer Tupolev announced that pre-project work on a supersonic passenger aircraft had been completed, and it was estimated that the aircraft would be able to reach a speed of 1,900 km/h at an altitude of 11 km.
This was reported by the Deputy Director-General of Valery Solobobov.
Ukrainian President Peter Poroshenko thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for making Ukraine more European.
He announced this on CNN.
He stated that he could only confirm Washington Post's words that Putin's aggression against Ukraine had resulted in Ukrainian unification.
"In 2013, the transatlantic integration of Ukraine, and NATO membership, supported 16% of Ukrainians.
Now it's over 54%.
Who did this?
Putin.
In 2013, Ukraine ' s European integration, and EU membership, supported 33 per cent of Ukrainians.
It's 74% now.
Who did this?
Putin," said Poroshenko.
So thank you, Mr. Putin, for making my country much more European and much more willing to defend European values and transatlantic values.
And we are absolutely confident that we will not return to the Russian Empire," the President of Ukraine stressed.
As the FACTS wrote, in late September 2018 President Peter Poroshenko was in the United States and attended the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly.

There's a club in Russia that I'm watching.
Former Chelsea and England captain John Terry - about why he attended the ninth round match of the Russian Spartacus Championship - Rostov (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club I'm watching.
I've been following him quite recently and I was interested in seeing him from the outside.
I can't say I'm a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize again for the decision, as Terry quotes Chelsea fans' website.
Remember, the Rostov with 18 points peaked at number three in the tournament table, and Spartacus placed at number five with 15 points in the asset.
On the next tour, the red-and-whites on October 7 will play with Eniseus, and the wards of Valery Karpin will take the Orenburg the day before.
The expensive violin was sold to a pawnshop for nothing.
When in the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnyard in Somerville, Massachusetts, a man brought a violin, a pawnshop employee offered only $50 for an old and unpaved instrument.
But an experienced store manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and sought expert advice.
It was then revealed that the violin was made in 1759 by famous Italian violinist Ferdinando Gallano and is estimated at $250,000.
The violin links alone are estimated at $16,000 to $18,000.
The investigation revealed that the violin had recently been stolen from one of the city's residents, and the instrument was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin came to the man who put it in the pawnshop, but it does not account for any previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now everyone bringing a violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
On the ninth round of the RPL, we will face an exciting confrontation: Spartacus will receive at its stadium in Tushin the Rostov under the leadership of Valery Karpin, a man known to be no stranger to the "people's team."
The particular spicyness of this meeting is given by the fact that clubs now have an equal number of 15 points, and they share 3 and 4 seats in the tournament table, behind the far-run Zenit and being in one point from Krasnodar, who plays with Dynamo tomorrow.
The red-and-whites now have a rough streak: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly flew into Rapida, and recently gave way to the Ahmatu house.
After the derby with the CSKA, which ended with a fair draw, Spartacus played the Blackmorec Cup with a minimum score and no difficulty, and it is too early to say whether Russia's most popular club is nearing recovery from the crisis.
The Rostov could not win three games in a row, but the losers don't know five games.
Let's see if Karpin can extend the win-win series with such a principled match.
The previous meeting of the Carpina Rostov with Spartacus ended in favor of the Metropolitan Team.
It starts at 7:00.
Indonesia is rocked by aftershocks after a massive tsunami
In Indonesia, where an earthquake occurred a few days ago, causing a three-metre tsunami, meteorologists observe more than 170 aftershocks.
The magnet was 7.4, mostly affected by Sulawesi Island, according to Russia 24.
Over 420 people were killed and more than 500 injured.
The authorities informed the population of the tsunami threat in advance, but later cancelled it.
The thing is, the instruments didn't detect the wave approaching.
The fate of dozens of other residents who were preparing to celebrate a national holiday at one of the waterfront towns of Palu, who was most devastated after the storm, is still unknown.
London has been accused of Moscow.
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcome of the cold war, stated British Defense Minister Gavin Williamson.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a performance at the ruling Conservative Party convention in Birmingham.
The threat is increasing, Iran and North Korea are increasingly dangerous, enemies are operating in grey areas through cyberattacks and false news, added the minister.
But the biggest one is Russia, which is building up its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements by Western politicians have been repeatedly denied by Moscow, and transmitted to TASS.
At the same time, the head of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunt, reported that Russia would have to pay a high price if it did not abide by international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned a story of poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March this year ex-Colonel GRU Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying for the UK, and his daughter Julia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on EU and NATO membership, subject to a change in the country's name.
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighbouring Greek province.
One of the first votes was voted by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a keen supporter of the renaming of the Republic as Northern Macedonia.
The preparation for the referendum and today's vote are monitored by international organizations.
The head of the monitoring mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers was organized:
Approximately 100 teams have travelled across the country to observe the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closing, then the counting of votes and the writing of records.
For a month, there were 10 of our teams in the country that monitored the preparation for the vote, the media, compliance with the electoral campaign financing law and the organization of the referendum.
Faye Dulgeri: "About 500 foreign observers are following the voting closely.
The observer groups shall record in detail what is happening and shall communicate with the members of the electoral commissions for their presentation in the final report.”
The translator compared Russian-German mentality
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples varies, but the few differences between them do not play a great role in understanding.
On International Interpreter Day, September 30, Barbel Saxe, a professional synchronist, spoke about this.
She has been translating from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
"Germans like to plan events calmly, and Russians, as the proverb puts it, "are slow, let's go fast."
But I don't think it's important for people to understand and to work as an interpreter," said the expert in the comment "RIA News."
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries need each other, "know history enough."
And in the future, Saxe noted, Germany doesn't make sense to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are a lot of things that determine our common destiny," she said.
The previous day, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany had stated that the country was trying to "make relations" with Russia and support them.
For Berlin, she said, the Northern Flow 2 pipeline project, which was built from the Russian coast to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea, was particularly important.

Russians donated one ruble to a low-wage MP
In Yekaterinburg, the Charitable Foundation "Man" opened a fundraiser for a member of the State Duma of Vera Ganzi, who complained of low salaries.
The campaign's progress can be traced to the organization's website.
"Man's Charitable Foundation expresses the hope that we can all save the people's servant.
We ask all interested people to give you a chance for life and a happy future!
All the funds raised will be handed over to the poor in person.
God save you!" says the foundation's report.
All the philanthropists want to raise 380,000 rubles for the MP, which is equal to a month's salary.
The reports on the assistance received are published on the fund's website at Vkontakte, where the organizers provide screenshots of remittances.
The most frequent donations are one ruble and 50 kopecks.
At the time of publication, the Russians had donated 1,633 roubles to Vera Ganza.
The fund-raising opened on 28 September following Ganzi's low-income complaint.
According to her, the deputy's average salary was 380,000 rubles, from which nothing remained, so it was necessary to spend money from a credit card.
Ganzia complained that parliamentarians were not reimbursed for representation costs.
The State Duma then stated that it would consider the possibility of paying representation costs to the deputies.

Comedy Night School led the American box office.
The Comedy of Evening School, which debuted at American cinemas last Friday, earned $28 million in rent for her first weekend.
This result allowed an unwitting picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish to lead the U.S. box office on September 28-30.
In the international market, the film, so far released in only 20 countries, raised $5.5 million, including 2 million British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line, Malcolm Lee's creation, remarkablely, has fared reasonably well ahead of the other Western-runner, the Smolfoot cartoon, the curious story of meeting the charming Yeti with a member of the human race, the existence of which the main hero never believed.
The project directed by Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig for his start-up weekend raised $23 million, generally meeting the expectations of experts predicting a 20-25 million ribbon for the weekend.
With regard to the sum of Smolfoot's fees, they currently amount to $38.6 million (which he has already made his debut in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active one, adding 3.6 million dollars to the film's treasury.
Three of the strongest has this time shut down the children's tale "The Mystery of the House with the Hours" from the horror master Eli Roth, finally proving that the director can make quality movies for audience 12+.
During her second week of rental, the filming of John Bellers' book with charming Jack Black with Kate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing the global total to 53.8 million.
Despite flying out of top 3, it continues to be surprising with the "+" sign the thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick "Simple request": in 17 days in American rental, Paul Fig's painting, from which some unrealistic financial accomplishments were initially not expected from the word "all", raised $43 million (including 6.6 million for 28-30 October) and right now has an estimated 62.9 million total revenue.
The last representative of the first five this week was the Horror of the Monsignor's Curse, which raised $5.4 million over the reporting period.
The spin-off "The Curse" at the end of 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas has $330 million in total earnings in their account and has recently been proud to be ranked as the most successful franchise film, which also includes two parts of the spell itself and two ribbons about Annabel's creepy doll.
Right after the horrorist Corinne Hardy, after the last weekend, another member of the genre, the debutante Hallfest, was placed as one of the major youth Horrors of the year.
On his first weekend, the child of the well-known editor (and recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who had previously worked in a number of large Horror projects, including the Happy Day of Death, which Hallfest is very similar in places, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh was the Madly Rich Asians ($4.15 million) who do not seem to think of falling out of the top 10 American box office: a romantic comedy that has been on the screens for the seventh week, following September, is the sixth in the highest-ranked tape genre in history with a figure of 165.7 million.
This is the amount that the picture has so far earned on the domestic market, with a total return of 218.8 million.
As for the last three lucky guys who went to the U.S. Top Ten in September 28-30, they were Predator, White Guy Rick, and... "Bag Mint" who earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million, and 1.1 million, respectively, over the weekend.
Let's add that next weekend in the United States will be gathering the long-awaited Ven with Tom Hardy, who, without any doubt, will gain leadership in the American box office on the first weekend of October.
Of the other premieres of the coming week, it is worth highlighting the musical melodrama "Star was born", the recipient of the Venice Film Festival from Bradley Cooper, and the crime drama "Your Hate".

Valery Belov: God helped Siberia today.
Vitjazia head coach Valery Belov - about defeating Siberia (3:4) in a regular KHL championship match.
"The College talked about Siberia fans, and I want to celebrate our fans," White's official website, Vityaya.
"I hope they'll support it as well, 'cause now almost every game is full of stadiums, great atmosphere.
In the game, God must have helped Siberia today, because they were very grossly wrong, especially our leaders.
At all, we lost the micro–0–3 match to our leading leaders, so it was hard for us to pull out this match, though there were moments.
But still, I'll take the fall.
Because I guess we missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was a different team."
"It's an ugly nepotism."
The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice at Voice.
"Voice 60+ viewers accuse mentor Leonid Agutin of "dirty comity and brazen swindling."
When in blind auditions he learned from the first note the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin, many hoped that he would remain neutral and would not turn to the performer.
But his son’s feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative for his team.
At that time, many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor for bias in the first stage.
But the joke went on, and the star's father took the place of more worthy performers completely unjustified.
And now the audience is not prepared to forgive Agutina such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by the nefarious and candid hobbies of dragging our close relatives to the final ladder.
I had already doubted Agutina's power and conscience not to carry his father to the end to the first place at all," Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin were talking about in "The Man From Television."
Meanwhile, for his father, Leonid Agutin "sleyd" the beautiful artists who really sang while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about Mom explaining it because the audience still wanted to see his father on the show.
But as it turns out, that's not the case, the audience wants an objective assessment and sees really talented artists in the final, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the Voices of the Agutin team - they were doomed."
"Agutin last time showed how much he loved Dad, and today was supposed to be a professional."
"The competition has lost its meaning".
"Delete two talented people from the project and leave in the project his dad who doesn't sing but whispers, how can you then call a mentor?"
"Like Dad singing, give him a concert at the Kremlin for your money and see how many people come to this concert."
It's the Voice show, not the Cool Relatives show.
"On the Agutin side, it was unprofessional".
"Then you should on your own show invite Dad to perform, not on a show that's made for Channel 1 money."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other player with real vocal data.
Why did a worker from Surgut with a great voice and a timbre leak, and Dad Agutina brought to the final?
And then we all complain that the same faces have been on stage and on screen for decades!
Because you can't make it through the nepotism!"
"What did you expect?
It's Russia!
There's blat and nepotism all over the place.
And the money in the family budget will be worth it!
The theater of absurdity continues!"
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional Voices, Gradsky's son appeared on blind auditions.
That's when it never occurred to me to take my son on my own team.
In fact, he said, "Come on, get out of here, it's all clear."
Agutin couldn't do what a professional did.
Military Canada is allowed to wear beards to promote spirit
Canada's Department of Defense has issued an order that allows soldiers to wear beards.
According to CBC, the bill contains instructions on beard care.

Russia will be fined for violations in the field of equity construction
From tomorrow, Russia will be fined for violations in the field of equity construction, broadcasting Russia 24 channel.
The penalty is imposed on companies and officials if they do not transmit the house data to the Common Housing Information System in time.
Innovation will help those who have decided to buy an apartment in a new building but are afraid of a developer’s bankruptcy.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
Due to amendments to the equity construction law, developers will have to borrow fully from the bank.
And many experts have already spoken about the possible high cost of apartments.
But as it turns out, not everyone agrees.
In central Kiev, a robber threatened a man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw money from an ATM.
The incident took place on the evening of 29 September at Ivana Kudri Street, reported by Metropolitan law enforcement.
According to the victim, the unsub approached him and started a conversation, but then suddenly grabbed the knife and demanded that the money and the mobile phone be given to him.
Since the victim had no cash, the stranger ordered the money to be removed from the bank card.
After the attacker received 4,000 hryvnias and a phone, he hit the victim and fled," says the report.
Law enforcement managed to apprehend the robber and turned out to be a 25-year-old Kievn.
He now faces up to seven years' imprisonment.
The police are also working on the theory of the perpetrator's involvement in other such crimes.
Let's remind you, there were several high-profile robberies of the collectors in Odessa the previous day.
In one case, armed robbers were caught using a drone.

He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the opposite side of the Moon, which would avoid interference from the Earth.
"This is the only place such a telescope could be deployed to explore space sources of radio radiation," added Petrukovich.
He also believes that the Moon could be used to test robotics, to use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in searching for primitive organics on Earth's satellite, a scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on planets.
The head of Roskosmos had previously said that in an optimistic version the Russian Federation could fly a manned mission to the Moon by 2030.
A offended client threw out a basket of feces in a 7-Eleven store.
Damian Simms, 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), what is called, "have a tooth" on the manager of a 24-hour network store 7-Eleven: in May, he kicked him out of the store for inappropriate behavior.
And he decided to take revenge on his enemy in the original way.
In the middle of the night, he went into the store and dumped on the floor and on a portion of the goods on the shelves the contents of the baskets he had brought with him.
There were feces and urine in the basket, which Simms "absorbed" from a nearby mobile biotualate.
The police officers who arrived on the scene arrested the vigilante.
He was jailed and released on bail at $300.
He was charged with unlawful entry into other people ' s property and criminal offences, and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although the crime of Simms appears to be more ridiculous than serious, the sentence may be quite severe, as it has been repeatedly in violation of the law: it is listed as grand theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, driving a car in a drunken state, and cruelty to animals.

I think we'll get him into the games next.

Zinke also noted that the situation was similar with Iran.
In order to resolve it, the Minister believes that there are two options: military and economic.
He would prefer not to use the first, so it was necessary to exert pressure and displace Iranian energy resources.

There was nothing I could do, and it really hurt.
Sergei Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
Russian pilot "Williams" Sergei Sirotkin commented on the outcome of the Russian Grand Prix race.
"To be honest, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner, I ended up between two cars that pinned me down.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, the moment, right away.
He was in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of us hit the pit stop, we'd get into the "clean air" and return to the pace, but the rubber was gone.
Plus fighting his partner, he was in contact, too.
I take it he was a little wrong.
We were in this situation on the most uncarried track of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," says Sirotkin RIA, "News."
Remember that Sirotkin finished 18 in the race at the Russian Grand Prix, the winner was British Mercedes pilot Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpišev called it absurd to remove Glugkov and Punko from the foundation of Spartacus.
The President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the removal of football players Denis Glugkov of Moscow's Spartacus and Andrei Punko from training with the main composition after a lime at the criticism of the team's head coach Massimo Carrera, reports Sports Weekend.
Carrera's actions were totally absurd.
To pay attention to things like that is a foolish thing to do.
I totally disagree with what Carrera's doing.
It only deepens the team's rift.
First of all, it's poems, you can read and perceive them as you want.
I wouldn't have reacted to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone has an opinion.
Second, everyone wants to bury themselves.
If Glugkov and Puncho put on likes, it doesn't mean they have anything against the coach.
I think the Italian doesn't have the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And it doesn't serve the team's normal climate.
Spartacus doesn't have a game today, so it didn't have to be blown up at all.
Maybe you should have laughed at it together.
Spartacus has a lot wrong on different lines, and there's a lot of irregularity after the introduction of young people.
The relationships within the team do not seem to add optimism before this match," I'm sure Tarpishchev.
The game of the two teams will take place on September 30 and begin at 7 p.m. Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously refused Spartacus, led Chelsea's youth team.
Sirius' inmates discussed nature-like technologies with scientists
The Sirius educational centre in Sochi, a member of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the National Research Centre “Kurchatov Institute”.
The researcher's speech took place within the framework of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Naturelike Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and is reported on the website of the educational centre on 29 September.
The lecture opened a documentary film, "Kurchatov's Codes", during which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, a correspondent member of the RA Mikhail Kovalchuk, described global challenges as driving civilization.
The scholar's lecture is published on Sirius' website.
School students have learned that modern technologies require a great deal of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such quantities.
Natural-like technologies, which young scientists are working on today, say the organizers of the forum, will help to address this problem.
Kowalchuk also raised the topic of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies and the risks inherent in the development of such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a tremendous good.
It's an explosive increase in medical technology, it's an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of natural-like technologies is in fact a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There's the other side-- a deliberate intervention in human life.
There are always risks.
A car showed up and people started dying under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I create medical new technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," quotes scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the meeting participants.
Speakers included the candidate for physics and mathematics, the head of the Kurchatov NBICS natural-like technology complex NRC "Kurchatov Institute" Julius Diakova and the head of the Kurchatov NBICS technology complex Vyacheslav Demin.
The Sirius Education Centre in Sochi was established by the Talant and Success Education Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure on the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational centre is to identify, develop and further professional support gifted children.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the All-Russian online olimpiade on information security "Kibervoz" would be sent to study at Sirius.

This was stated by American Rear Admiral Dave Johnson, transmitting "Rosbalt" citing The National Interest.
"We are facing a severe potential opponent.

Macedonia: referendum not held due to low turnout
The referendum was intended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country "North Macedonia".
Greece objected to the Macedonians' use of the name of their historic province.
The renaming gave the former Yugoslav Republic the chance to open its way to NATO and later to the EU.
But according to EFE, only 34 per cent of Sunday's plebiscite appearance "did not reach the constitutional threshold of 50 per cent.
However, since the referendum was only of a consultative nature, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to waive the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, a supporter of the change of name of the Republic, stated that if there were more “yes” votes cast, Macedonia would change the name despite an unachieved quorum.

Kemerochan outraged a flock of sheep in the cemetery
On September 30, the well-known Kemera page on the social network reported from an eyewitness that horny animals were freely walking around one of the local cemeteries.
Animals of a large herd walked between the fence and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different views: some local residents noted that there was no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery and their appetite could even help clear the area from weeds and grasslands, but some of the city's inhabitants did not like the animal's behavior:
"These are graves, not pastures.
You don't have to do that.
Of the rams, you can't say they are blasphemous, but it's not a matter."
In any event, some eyewitnesses noted that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery was already known, and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
Push and pull, right?
The word "press" does not exist.
That's right, let's do it.
The word "press" in the meaning of "strength, influence, influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "satisfying."
We use that word, believing it comes from the word "pressure."
But "pressure" and "satisfaction" aren't exactly close, but they're even in a way opposite.
See for yourself.
To move (church-book, obsolete) means "satisfying, full, sufficient, sufficient for anyone or anything, to satisfy."
Satisfying, pleasure, related words.
He used to have the meaning of "not depending on anything, being self-fulfilling" - "being satisfied."
The old Slavic "devil" is related to the words "lead" and "wolf."
Pressure, suppression, it's completely different.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (pressing sheep), deyja - "died" and dvaid" - "punish".
A similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "fulfill" as well as the latter's imminent obsolescence, forced them to enter the contamination.
So we've got this "d" thing, which is also used on the letter through "a," which is probably wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of creating and developing these words.
Okay, that's right, let's get it done.
But that word is obsolete, in its proper meaning no longer used.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people have a negative influence on you from above, use the word "press".
You can also use the pressure design, but remember that it's candelarith.

"Please, yes, but you never know how it'll turn out.
It won't be easy anyway, 'cause our car's a lot slower than Mercedes cars.

Russian bailiffs demanded debt with a dead old lady.
In Kurgan, bailiffs demanded 200 rubles for a long-term deceased woman.
This is reported by the Ural Meridian.
In mid-September, relatives of the deceased Maria Mitrophanovna Blindewa received a letter from the Kurgan Division of bailiffs, in which it was reported that the 105-year-old woman had been the subject of executive proceedings.
The court ordered a woman to pay 200 roubles to the local tax inspectorate.

One of the participants in the Nevros Douman campaign stated that the purpose of the demonstration was to demonstrate the unity of society and solidarity on the issue.
Refugees and migrants should not be considered as others and migration itself was the mother of that society.
Numerous migrant communities and anti-racism organizations had sent an open letter of resignation to the Minister.
With the help of an operation in Syria, Russia has shielded itself from terrorists
In the course of three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists have been killed, 85,000 of whom have destroyed Russian air and space forces.
This was described on the occasion of the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by former head of the SCC, Victor Bondarev, head of the Federation Defense and Security Council committee.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of aerial weapons: air and space forces had targeted and continued to strike terrorist targets precisely.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist sites had been destroyed in Syria in three years, such as ammunition depots, fortifications and headquarters.
Russian airstrikes broke into the jihadist defenses, making a decisive contribution to the promotion of Syrian government troops, handing over the Interfax.
However, according to Bondarev, our military operation in Syria allowed Russia itself to be shielded from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IG, banned in Russia) and Jebhat al-Nusru (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, some 4,000 Russian militants and about 5,000 citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the IG side, transferring TASS.
And it's only the recorded individuals, not including those who have not been identified, that Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter freely into our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at far-off borders - otherwise this evil would have "floated to us."
Boris Johnson's phones and a number of British ministers are publicly available.
The personal data of a number of former and current UK ministers became publicly available due to a security failure of the application created by the Conservative Party, transmits Sky News.
In particular, the mobile phone numbers of the Minister of Finance, Philip Hammond, and the ex-head of the British MID Boris Johnson were available.
According to the network, several politicians received "unfavourable calls."
The technical problem has been resolved, and the application is now safe to use.
We study the reasons for the breakdown and apologize for any problems caused," said the Conservative Party.
During the crash, users were able not only to see confidential data, but also to edit information in the profiles of politicians and journalists.
For example, in the profile of the Minister of Environment, Ecology and Agriculture, Michael Gove, his picture was replaced by a picture of Rupert Murdoch's media image.
Syria accused the US of supporting terrorism
Syrian MFA leader Walid Muallem accused the US and their partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas it targeted, it massacred civilians, including children and women.
These murders are war crimes under international law," he said.
According to Muallem, the U.S. and its partners provided “direct support to terrorists”, as the targets of militants and the Western coalition in Syria overlapped and implied “the sowing of chaos, death, and destruction in their path”.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria was almost complete and that the country had become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intended to clear Syria of an illegal foreign presence, and that Syrian partners would be given priority in the reconstruction of the country.
In September, the head of the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of the Confronting Parties in the Republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savichenko, stated that two American F-15 aircraft had attacked the Syrian province of Dayr al-Zor with prohibited phosphorus.
The US rejected all charges.
Ukrainian President Peter Poroshenko believes that, while respecting the sovereignty of other States, Ukraine is entitled to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
This was stated by the Head of State during a trip to Kharkiv Oblast, commenting on Hungary's issuance of its passports to Zakarpatya.
In protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our State.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other States, we demand the same respect for Ukraine," stressed Poroshenko.
According to Poroshenko, as president, he will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they may be, in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the Head of State supported the position of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Hungarian passport scandal, which was the intention of expelling the Consul of that country from the Coast.
"I fully share every letter that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said," noted the President.
The FACTS reported that on 19 September, a video appeared on the web showing the time Ukrainian citizens were issued Hungarian passports at the Hungarian consulate in Beregovo.
In doing so, they swore their allegiance to Hungary out loud.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Pavel Klimkin, noted that the Consul of Hungary, who appeared on video of the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, had to leave Ukrainian territory either by decision of Budapest itself or would be expelled by Kiev.
It was also reported that the Prosecutor ' s Office of Zakarpatsky Region had initiated criminal proceedings for the issuance of Hungarian passports.

Putin flew secretly to Siberia.
Vladimir Putin is known to have spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he participated in the work of the CIS Council of States, as well as a number of bilateral meetings with the Presidents of neighbouring countries.
Data on Russian "Borta No. 1" flights on Flightradar indicate that around 6 p.m. in Tajik time on 28 September, Il-96-300 flew from Dushanbe airport and took a north-east course.
In the area of Lake Balhash, the plane's transponder was switched off.
The direction of his flight indicates that the liner could have flown to Hakasia.
According to Baykal24, the president in Abakana met Victor Zimin, the head of the region, personally on the night of 29 September.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the Republic to spend the weekend, but the site's sources believe that the real reason is "the problem of the second round."
Next Sunday, a second round of elections for the head of the region is scheduled to take place in Hakasia.
It featured Valentin Konovalov (CRPF) and the current head of the Republic, Victor Zimin (Single Russia).
However, on 21 September, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
Andrei Filyagin (“Just Russia”) is to take part in the upcoming tour with Konovalov.
The Hakasian media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Hakasia and appoint a new Vrio of the head of the Republic, as well as decide on the fate of Zimin.
Putin had already visited Hakasia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president's favorite places to rest.
More than 10 million Syrians have been refugees since the outbreak of the armed conflict in Syria for seven years.
Some five million people fled to other countries, particularly neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Damascus now believes that the hostilities are nearing completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
The Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Muallem, said in his address to the United Nations: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The Government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists, returning them to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country that they have had to flee because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions, which have made their lives and livelihoods more difficult.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate and provide funds for the return of refugees.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, arguing that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.
Volkswagen fully pleaded guilty to "dieselgate" in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the company's American division managers, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The loss of the company is estimated to be at least €25 billion.
This amount does not include only fines and compensation.
Until June of next year, the automaker is obliged to buy or fix 85 per cent of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company's management stated that 83% of the vehicles had already been committed, so the program would be completed ahead of schedule.
Volkswagen is working hard to compensate for the losses and restore the trust of its clients.
For example, the management of the company has recently changed again, and a major restructuring and policy changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: this right was granted to the authorities in February this year.

Metropolitan Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the OPC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the synodal Division of External Ecclesiastical Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church of the Metropolitan Ilarion compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against the Jews.
"It's like putting a yellow sharp-pointed star on a Jew in Fascist Germany, which means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and it was for that purpose that this bill was created," stated the Metropolitan on Russia-24 (quoted in Interfax).
In his view, that step would have the most serious consequences at a time when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was at an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control of the UPC and “to outlaw it”, believes the clergyman.
"It's a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they're patriots of their country," he added.
It has previously been reported that deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills Nos. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the renaming of the OPC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The vice-president of Pochaevskaya laura called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The deputy of the St.-Uspen Pochaevsky Lavra of the Metropolitan Vladimir made a call for the protection of Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) was published on Saturday on the home site.
At various times in history, our predecessors and fellow Christians had to profess their faith and protect their holy places.
Given the situation, and according to the information available to us and the threats of murder that are spreading, it is clear that we will also have to survive something," the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support, prayerful, moral.
He also stressed that your physical presence would probably be needed.
The minister added: "Lenin's grandkids, in spirit, threaten to kill, and therefore protect our holy place."
Those who care about the fate of the Pochaevsklav, an Orthodox Ukrainian and universal shrine, must be prepared to protect it, is said in the address.
The Metropolitan called for the avoidance of those who mislead the believers.
The OPC has a canonical status defined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to be made dependent on the news patriarch and a friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status our church has," noted the viceroy of laura.
He recalled that the UPC had been canonically independent and fully independent in its management since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What other Tomos do we need?" noted the Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochayev, urging believers and all citizens to ask whether the other Tomos denominations had any independence from the Vatican?
The believers settled to some extent and decided which temple they should go to.
Some, however, want to sow enmity and strife again.
Some are jealous that the dome is shining on temples they want to destroy," the minister stressed.
The Pochayevian lair is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
It is located on top of Pochaevsky Mountain, 70 kilometres from Ternopolis.
Its first history dates back to the early 13th century.

The head coach of Moscow's Dynamo Vladimir Vorobiev - about the defeat of the Automabilist (0:1) in the regular KHL championship match.
"A good game was, interesting though it was going to goal" - quotes Sparrow's official website, "Automabilist".
"Staying to play is very easy.
I really liked the first period.
Didn't use a few good moments.
In the second period, our opponent got us a little tough, we stood up.
But we've been fed a little bit.
The guys played great, doing the coaching.
I think if we keep playing the right game, the wins will come.
Not scored, no goals won't win, but the content of the game was right.
Luck will come if we continue to play in this direction."
"In your view, did the Autobilist add up to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
"Then there was no foreign link.
At the preseason, the teams were doing other tasks, playing many young guys.
I think there was a completely different game, a different hockey game.
"Automobile" is a good team.
It's clear from the tournament table that the team is playing the right game.
Good hockey, good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
We can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
Lots of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were getting ready.
They knew the team was going without defeat, they wanted to break it, but they didn't."

The main Macedonian opposition refused to vote in the referendum
In Macedonia, a referendum is being held on Sunday, 30 September, on an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: Do you support EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece?
However, the leader of the leading opposition party, Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (WMRO-DPMNE), Christian Mitzko said that he would not vote in the referendum.
According to Party spokesman Naum Stoilkovsky, Mizkoski decided to abstain from voting to express his opposition to a treaty that he considered "harmful."
According to the spokesperson, the current referendum resolves the issue of renaming the country, and no more than the party's strategic objective is to gain membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, President Georg Ivanov of Macedonia refused to participate in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that he had chosen the name for the country 27 years ago in the referendum on independence. The Macedonian leader considered the renaming of the country a negative factor.
"A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being published," said Ivanov.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Republic of Northern Macedonia, was signed by the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece on 17 June this year during a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which borders the two countries.
This treaty should resolve the long-standing dispute over the name of the country, as well as Skopje's journey to NATO and the EU, reminds TASS.

The US is increasing opiate production in Afghanistan
The dramatic deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on 26 September was much talked about in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev.
Indeed, in Afghan territory, militants have unleashed a real terrorist war against the State authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year is the highest number of bloody attacks that have killed thousands of ordinary Afghans," said Patrushev.
Afghanistan's troubles didn't start yesterday.
Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, an Al-Qaida terrorist group (prohibited in the Russian Federation) in Afghanistan was declared the main enemy of the United States.
Not even a month later, America and NATO allies began military operation Enduring Freedom there.
It's been 17 years.
The thousands of American troops are now on Afghan soil.
And a peaceful life is even more elusive than it was then.
American troops have been driven over the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they pay off the militants for money, just so they don't get touched.
The Government of Afghanistan controls less than 40 per cent of the country, according to Patrushev.
50 per cent are from the Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10 per cent is for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they grow up there fast.
The aim is to create a barbaric pseudo-phalyphate in Central Asia, exactly what they did not have in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be comfortable with that.
Similarly, in 17 years of American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan increased by at least 40 times.
The vast growth of the area sown with opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.
The Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on EU and NATO membership, subject to a change in the country's name.
The agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the outcome of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbour to be called Macedonia, looking in that name at the attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, a political scientist, "Thanks to this agreement Macedonia or Northern Macedonia gets the right to a better future, the hope of societal change.
And Greece will establish the right to its past.
There's no such thing as perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises cannot make everyone happy."
The country's renaming is supported by the ruling Social Democrats led by Prime Minister Zoran Zayev.
Conservative opposition and the country's president, Georg Ivanov.
According to journalist Luthorin Chilmanov, Macedonia does not make sense to join the EU - it is sufficient to have a partnership with it: “Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zayev is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First and foremost, the loss of sovereignty.
It is clear that there are countries that would not like Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Faye Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole."
