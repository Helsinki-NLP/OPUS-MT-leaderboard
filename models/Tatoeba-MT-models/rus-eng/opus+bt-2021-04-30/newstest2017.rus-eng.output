28-year-old cook found dead at San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a flight of stairs at the local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, noting, "He was finally doing well."
A body found in Westfield Moll on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, reported by the San Francisco Forensics Bureau.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told KGO to ABC's television and radio company in San Francisco that Frank, a former distribution line cook in Boston, had received his dream job as a cook at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and crushed" by his death.
"We're a small team that works as a friendly family and will be very missed," said the spokesman.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Louis Galicia said Frank was staying in the hostels at first, but lately, "He was finally doing well."
"He found an apartment, he dated a girl," Louis Galicia said to KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a great heart.
His way of communicating with his family has always been to cook us a dish, to cook us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any fight.
He was a brother who sailed the stream.
"With all the bad things going on with this world, he was the unbounded diamond that shined brightly every day," he said.
Everyone who owns the information is asked to call the SFPD Hotline at 415-575-4444.
Churkin stated that the UN Sovbez meeting on Crimea was useful.
The Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, said that the recent UN Security Council meeting on Crimea had been useful, transmitted the Interfax.
"I think the discussion was good for us, and we gave them information about what happened," Churkin said.
He explained that, in closed consultations, Sovbeza had provided Member States with information on incidents in the territory of the Republic of Crimea and read out a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, which “expressed concern and outrage at the attempted terrorist attack and sabotage in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.

Italy’s public debt has increased to record levels
Italy's public debt in June 2016 exceeded Euro2.248 trillion.
At the central bank, the country has stated that this amount is the historical maximum, transmitting the RIA News.
The previous negative record was set in May this year.
The public debt then reached Euro2.228 trillion.
It is noted that Italy ' s debt burden increased by 77.2 billion euros in the first half of the year.
It was previously reported that Italy ' s public debt stood at 132.7 per cent of the country ' s GDP at the end of 2015.
Meanwhile, the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance, Pierre Carlo Padoán, projected a drop to 130.9 per cent in 2016 and to 123.4 per cent of GDP in 2018.
Payments from the airport were received by 141 victims of the attack at the Domodovo.
141 people received charitable payments from the Aviation Foundation, which was established by the management of Domodovo Airport to assist victims of the 2011 terrorist attack, reports Interfax.
According to Aleksandr Vlasov Airport spokesman, two other statements are under consideration.
“The foundation continues to provide charitable benefits to victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and provides full assistance to resolve existing issues”, added Vlasov, recalling that a fund website was created specifically to facilitate interaction with victims, providing full information on how to provide charitable assistance.
In 2011, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device in a foreign airship.
The attack killed 37 people and injured 172 others.
Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years.
The International Group of Biologists concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, transfers RT.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the glass of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five metres long, may be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that low metabolism, which leads to slow development, plays an important role in shark longevity.
Female Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity only by 150 years of age.
It was previously believed that the longest-lived vertebrate animals lived the "neighbor" shark, a Greenland whale.
The oldest known scientist was just over 210 years old.
Putin changed the composition of the Sovbeza FF.
Russian President Vladimir Putin by decree changed the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, reporting to the Kremlin press service.
It was previously reported that Putin had removed President Sergei Ivanov's head of administration, and Anton Vino was appointed his successor.
Ivanov will now serve as the Special Representative of the President on environmental, environmental and transport issues.
The Deputy Secretary of the Council, Rashid Nurgaliev, was removed from the permanent membership of the SB of the Russian Federation.
The council includes Sergei Ivanov, Anton Vino, half-presidency of the President in SFO Sergei Noylo and half-presidency in SZFO Nikolai Tsukanov.
Sergei Ivanov has been relieved of his post as Chief of Staff of the President.
President Sergei Ivanov was relieved of his duties as head of the Kremlin administration by decree.
Ivanov has been appointed Special Representative of the Russian Federation for environmental, environmental and transport activities.
Anton Vino, formerly deputy to Sergei Ivanova, has been appointed as the new chief of administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked him to move to another job.
Should we go to the sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the head doctor of Olga Bogus Sanatorium.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of working, should he go to the sanatorium?
Sanitary and spa rest is needed not only for treatment, but also for disease prevention.
Under sanatorium conditions, a person can examine his or her body and receive medical advice on how to live so that his or her health will not be destroyed.
Such recommendations would be of no use to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal to the body, and you don't have to get rid of it.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And the stress is about 90% of visitors.
The most vulnerable are people from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's best not to complicate the situation and let yourself rest in time.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people decrease their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to spend a vacation with the kids, you don't have to break up with them.
Health programmes for children, even the smallest ones, include both diagnostic services, paediatric consultations, testing and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalations, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, and physical exercise.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor, taking into account individual indications and the characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, children's club with animations usually operates in sanatoriums, where children can attend play classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even to guests with infants, provide breast-feeders with the necessary facilities and provide an experienced nurse.
The soft winter, the long summer, the abundance of sunny days in a year (over 300) create good conditions for a year-round rest at the resorts of the Caucasus Mineral Waters.
And then the body doesn't need to rest just in the summer.
So you don't have to be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are indoors and don't depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium and resort treatment is desirable twice a year, especially for mature people.
The main feature of the Caucasus Mineral Water region is, of course, curative mineral sources: Slavianovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect the various systems of the organism.
Water differs in temperature, number of salts, general mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor picks up the water depending on the patient's well-being.
For example, Narzan has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating effects, re-establishes gastrointestinal tract functions and metabolism exchange.
Essentuky-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces sugar levels.
The "Essentuke New" has anti-inflammatory, gall and urinary effects.
The water Slavanovskaya also has the same effects.
When assigning water, the doctor must take into account the condition of the circulatory system.
If there are signs of hypertension, he picks up less salty water because salts hold the liquid, leading to increased pressure.
The reception of mineral water requires a regime: water should be consumed at a certain time, in the right quantity and at a specific temperature.
Various cosmetological procedures for the face and body are now available in sanatoriums.
What types of recovery based on the natural features of the North Caucasus can be obtained from resorts in this region?
Near Fiveigorsk, for example, there is a salty Lake Tambukan, from which the tin mud is useful for joints, spines, and internal organs.
It produces anti-inflammatory, dissipating, immunomodulating effects.
It's a health walk on individualized routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is close to the mineral source Narzan.
You can also take baths of wine, pearls, iodine, selenium, saffeine-larky depending on what a doctor assigns you.
Let's prolong the procreation.
What can I do to make the harvest go by the end of the season?
Tells Julia Belopuchova, agronomist and giver.
It's time for the tall Tomatos to get a haircut: remove the new shepherds, cut the tops, remove all the leaves to the penultimate brush with the fruit and the flower with the small cords - they won't be ripe.
All tomatoes, regardless of "constitution", as well as peppers and eggplants, are fed with a gold-superphosphate extract, treated with biopreparates (preparator - to accelerate the fill and growth of fruit, Phytosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Baktofit - from disease, Immunococytophitis - to increase immunity, Bitoxybacillin, Lepidocide, Fitoverm - if there are pests).
Only copper soup, colloid sulphur, and green soap should be used at the end of the summer.
We're making the last irrigation of the plants.
The long-fingered cucumbers in the greenhouse are brought down from the spaler so that the lower, naked part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, we water with warm water and the Circon solution, and we slip the stem 5-7 cm composte.
It is also easy to extend the fruitage of the courgette: cut the old leaves, pour warm water and a compound fertilizer solution, and put the fertile soil under the bush.
In order to protect against the cold of the night, set the arc of sheltered material above the range.
Keep the plants open by day, and close after sundown.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists saw signs of Russia’s exit from the longest recession in 20 years.
According to researchers interviewed by Bloomberg, the GDP of the Russian Federation shows a positive trend, with a decline of 0.8 per cent in annual terms in the second quarter of GDP.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the Russian economy slowed down to 0.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The situation has also recently been stabilized by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development.
Slow growth is ahead.
According to CDB experts, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
"Russian GDP index estimates indicate that the recession is behind us and that the economy is ahead of us is slowly growing," says the Bank of Russia's bulletin "What Trends Speaks".
The variable GDP estimate for the current quarter was raised to 0.4 per cent by regulators, and the estimate for the fourth quarter was 0.5 per cent.
According to the representative of Mineconom Development, during the second quarter the Russian Federation's GDP fell by 0.2% in the second quarter.
In the second quarter, the seasonally purified decline in GDP was 0.2% by the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the recession stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was between 0 and 0.15," quotes the representative of IRE RIA's "News".
The slowing down of the Russian economy during the last five quarters indicates that it has passed the bottom.
Among other markers indicating signs of a recovery in the national economy, Bloomberg refers to rising demand for electricity and rail transport, and a revival of business.
If the year is adjusted to be a leap year, it is understandable that the change in plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to the extra working day.
Add to this lower annual average temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it's hard to get accurate data here, and plus or minus 0.5% of the six-year volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Cyril Yakovenko of ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent, compared with 15.6 per cent last month.
Moreover, for the past two weeks, Rosstat has recorded deflation.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If you look at the rate of the ruble, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has been strengthened by 12 per cent since the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of recovery that should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," Jakovenko emphasizes.
In addition, industrial production has increased since April in the Russian Federation.
The figure increased by 1.7 per cent in June.
The rate of decline in foreign trade has slowed from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The situation in the labour market, where unemployment has fallen to 5.4 per cent, also shows positive developments.
It was only lower in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the question of real disposable incomes of the population is left to be left to be desired.
In annual terms, the rate decreases by 4.8 per cent.
This factor may impede economic recovery, as household expenditure contributes significantly to GDP.
Generally, their share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50 per cent.
In addition to low consumer activity, the tight policies of the Bank of Russia can also be described as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which does not have a better effect on the real sector.
Lack of investment is also a negative factor, which constrains the development of industrial capacity.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the economy of the Russian Federation will be slowing down to -0.5 per cent, as opposed to -3.7 per cent in 2015,” says GC Forex Club analyst Irina Rogov.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well-settled in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, is not yet so actively developed in summer sports.
While Russians and former foreigners compete in the Rio Games, in most cases they are natives of the former republics of the Soviet Union.
In Rio de Janeiro, however, we can see the reverse process, with a fairly large number of Russians flying the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of the change of nationality varies.
Some parents took someone to another country when they were little, leaving no choice.
Someone failed to compete for a seat in the Russian team.
And someone thought that the best conditions for development in sports would be created abroad.
Aif.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
A 27-year-old girl's German passport says her name is Lisa Red.
But earlier, she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years after the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There, she decided to follow in her older sister's footsteps to do athletics.
Like my sister, Lisa chose to jump with a sixth.
If she were to stay in Russia, I don't think she'd be able to move Elena Isinbayev off the throne.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be our only countrywoman, though ex-girlfriend, in the sixth jump sector.
Her best achievements in this sport are the 2010 European Championship bronze and the 2016 continental championship silver she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
Elena Piejokova, 29, was born in Novakuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelists.
Many because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started fighting at school.
Showing good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued her studies at the U.S. Training Center under another former Russian Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 London Olympics, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Cup that same year, it was a victory.
Before that, by the way, she had won silver at the 2010 World Championship.
After that, there was a 2013 bronze and 2014 silver.
The 26-year-old Maria was born in Yaroslavla, where she first met a synchronous voyage.
But it would be wrong to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Maria continued her studies.
She soon joined the U.S. team and showed excellent results at the Pan American Games.
Clearly, at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America it is the ceiling.
A new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Christine Shaldybina received at the age of 11 when her parents decided to continue her education in art gymnastics across the ocean.
Until then, the girl had a favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Emigrating to the United States, she quickly joined the youth team of this country, and later broke into the main national team as well.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
She certainly did not have to fight for the first positions on the world stage, but for the United States, she staged a real breakthrough - bringing the star-lane team to the Rio Games.
Another of our former artists is Jan Berezko-Marggrander, who is in favour of Germany.
Jana was born in Toliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more chances of joining the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 London Olympics.
It is true that Jana was only able to take 17th place, not enough to enter the finals in her personal championship.
Two years earlier, however, she had managed to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games, a young man.
Another gymnast, except this time, Irina Sazonova.
If the routes of emigration of the above-mentioned female athletes can be described as standard, the choice of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgograd Sports School.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became a champion of the country.
True, Ira is training in Russia, but he's coming to his home country on purpose so he won't lose his skill.
In Rio, she didn't perform as well as she'd like.
The best place is 40 in the private line.
There is very little information about the swimmer Maria Ugolkova in Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria has lived and trained in Switzerland.
For a long time, however, it has played under the Russian flag, showing good results - even the country's record at 200 metres of butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began performing under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th in the 4×100 complex relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project that was able to raise about 6,000 francs, which allowed her to pay for preparations for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle fighter Adam Batyrov spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native Hasavürt was able to become a three-time European championship winner, a Russian champion, and an international-class Russian sports master.
When he stopped joining our national team, it was time to think of a change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented wrestler disappeared from sports posts.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won the gold medal and received a trip to the Rio Olympics.
Another ex-Rossian, Mikhail Kudinov, is even less known in his home country than even Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The thing is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
That's where Michael started playing gymnastics.
It has not made much progress at the international level.
In Rio, its best result was 40th in qualification on parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting into the Olympic Games in gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronized swimming activities, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the 2014 European Championships in Berlin, the girl ranked 6th in synchronized swimming.
In the duet with Eugenia, Tetelbaum Anastasia ranked eighth.
She was the fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Creiter plays for Israel.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitri had already become the country's champion.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Crowther also wins the gold of the Youth Olympics in Singapore.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitri engages in long jumps and triple jumps.
31-year-old Albert is another native of Hasavürt, who, after long speaking for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, however, he competed for Krasnoyarsk High School of Sport, even becoming the country's champion in 2011.
Oleg Antonov, 28, was born in Moscow to Soviet volleyball player Yaroslav Antonov.
Literally a year before the birth of Yaroslav's son, he was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained permanently there.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became a bronze medalist for the European Championship held on the territory of his new homeland.
Hadjiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and hit his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, parents decided to emigrate.
The original target was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country -- we had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn to fight freely.
He soon won the world's first junior championship and later qualified for the Olympic Games as well.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
Again, a free struggle, and again a former Russian.
This time we're talking about a native of North Ossetia who emigrated to Spain, Timuraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and is currently in favour of the country's team.
Before that, though, a 30-year-old athlete was able to record high results in Russia as well.
He became a bronze medalist for the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
Statutes from non-entry, Timuraz decided to change sports citizenship.
The last one on our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital Dagestan Mahachkal, Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur began boxing on the advice of his older brother.
Since then, Arthur has been the Canadian champion three times, and in 2012 he became the youth world champion.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why do kids need Cossack classes in school?
According to Governor V. Condretiev, "It is not shares and parades that need to be raised, but systemicly."
They must grow up and realize at least from the age of 7 that they are Cossacks and education must be Cossacks.
But so far, I believe, this work is being carried out formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If Cossack classes take on all the positive things previously accumulated, at a qualitatively new level, I'd be glad.
If everyone's excited and ignorant, the new idea will turn out to be cheap populism.
WHC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors in the country's economy.
There is an attacker on funds allocated to the public sector from different levels of budgets.
According to the Office of the Attorney-General, overcharges are one of the most common crimes in the area of HAC.
As a result, consumers in the region overpaid more than 170 million roubles in energy.
Recently, the Krasnodar Krai Prosecutor's Office also found evidence of the inclusion of undue costs in the tariffs.
And 4 million roubles were charged to IV Consulting (cold water) for the rental of vehicles at a price above the market price.
And there's a lot of such examples in the country.
According to the Ministry of the Russian Federation, the average collection rate of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of the proceeds of crime, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the foundation that was repairing urban facilities, Makarov entered into contracts with entrepreneurs, they were actually not performed, but paid for.
Businessmen just gave him most of the money back.
And as the owner of the PC, Makarov collected money from the public, but the service providers did not pay or spend it for their own needs.
As a result, millions of rubles have been damaged by the budget and the tenants.
Makarov's scheme of machinations is, alas, typical of Russia.
There has been a wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Criminal Code, who have embezzled the money of citizens.
On Kamchatka, the trial of A. Cohan, by the way, is ongoing, also a former councillor accused of fraud of 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013 he established 6 company managers in Elizovo Kamchatsky Province and created 3 limited liability societies.
One of them performed contractual work for the PC, and two others played the role of clearing houses, i.e. taking money from the population.
However, A. Cohan's energy did not transfer the funds, but spent on himself, the loved one.
It is difficult to sue in the area of HAC.
Cases don't go on, they're going on.
And "helps" in this very confusing housing legislation, says Svetlan Razvernev, executive director of HKH Control.
We don't have one law to make, as we come up with a new one that should make the previous one work.
There are also few professionals, including judges, on HAC.
The lawyers themselves acknowledge that housing law is very low in higher education.
Refusals to institute criminal proceedings and red tape during investigations are also mentioned in the Office of the Attorney-General.
Less than half of the 3,500 crimes under investigation in 2015 have been brought to court.
The remaining investigations had become protracted, and one in five had been suspended due to the failure to identify the accused.
Often, the shortcomings of law enforcement agencies have been reduced to gaps in the existing legislation.
There is a law, but the authorities of inquiry are slow to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting - only 60 criminal cases have been initiated.
The number has increased only slightly over the five months of this year - 99.
And what is falsifying the minutes of the assembly of tenants?
This means changing the management of the house, financial and other matters circumvent the opinion of the owners.
It also means that the housing and public services market cannot be reached by normal companies that want to work honestly, not by "killing" the population.
So, the tenants are in minus, so is the small and medium business.
First and foremost, through the eradication of corruption as such in the entire State, Anton Jarkov, a member of the State Property Committee, is certain.
This work is now being actively pursued.
These are not just isolated actions; they are a focused anti-corruption policy.
Of course, not all regions are in such a sad situation.
In particular, the capital doesn't smell like scandal.
Why is there no such scandal in Moscow as in many other regions?
Because the capital government showed iron will and order, he told the AiF Anatoly Chosen, a member of the State Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean both the personnel issue, the legislative amendments, and the legal education.
Managing companies are subject to close supervision and all have been licensed.
Citizens ' complaints are promptly resolved in public space (and the addresses of residents, and responses are posted on the Moscow Government portal).
Many do not simply pay monthly receipts, but closely monitor what is written there, how the house is kept.
Public awareness of the rights of owners and the obligations of resource providers and managers is very high.
Plus, Moscow is testing the validity of housing and utilities tariffs - a large part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
It's probably all together, and it explains the calm situation in Moscow.
So it's all about the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe an unwitting person should change his place of work.
Turkish Gambit.
Can Erdogan give up friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan nominated the US ultimatum, offering to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d'état.
He stated this in front of his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to give up their support for the "Fethullachist terrorist organization".
This is not the first statement from Turkey calling on the US to change its position.
Experts believe that Turkey’s division with the West is increasing and could lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
"America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO sooner or later (the Terroristic Organisation of the Fethullahists).
Either the staging of the Pheto coups or the democratic Turkey.
She must make that choice," quotes the Anatolian agency Erdogan's address on Wednesday night in Ankara.
Turkey’s president once again, but more strongly, demanded that the US comply with his demand, which he voiced for the first time immediately after the mutiny was suppressed.
It should be recalled that, on the night of 16 July, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army in Turkey attempted to overthrow the legitimate authority in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the Head of State.
However, after Regep Erdoğan addressed the population, the rebellion was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In total, some 8,000 people were suspected, including teachers and scientists in addition to the military.
According to Regep Erdogan, they were mentored by Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan's supporters also admitted that Americans could be directly involved in the coup d'état.
The United States denied all claims against it, refusing to issue Gulen and recommending a change of tone.
The latest statement by the State Department on this matter was made at the time of Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey, who insists on his own and also demands on his other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not specify a date for the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens”, stated Turkish Minister of EU Affairs Omar Chelik on 9 August.
He said that Ankara's amendment of the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe's own security.
Note that on August 1, German Vice Chancellor Zigmar Gabriel demanded Turkey to stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders to migrants in order to obtain visa relief with the EU.
His words were in response to the relevant statement of the head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevluta Chavushoglu.
Another provocative statement by Chavushoglu made on the previous Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not exclude that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance unless it met the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence field is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign states in the defence field - bringing in missiles," said Chavushoglu in an interview with Anadolu.
Turkey, he said, now needed to build its own defence system on the basis of its technology, as well as to cooperate with other countries.
"To date Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others," said the minister.
Experts believe that all this points to Turkey's serious disagreement with the West and the country's reorientation towards the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Analysis, Evgeny Minchenko, believes that Regep Erdoğan is now playing his game and cannot go on a violent confrontation with the West.
He has a lot tied to the West from a business point of view, and from a military point of view (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance by maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a fully obedient person in this post," explained AiF.ru.
According to him, it is possible that following statements by the Turkish leader (on the non-payment of EU compensation, the demand for visa-free space with Europe, and the extradition of Gülen from the United States), he will be pressured.
"Regep Erdoğan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will press him on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governing the country, and so on," Minchenko says.
The head of the Political Information Centre Alexei Muhin admits that the President of Turkey will change his point of view with Russia as soon as it benefits him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan was extremely hard on Russia and sought favor in the West in every way.
In a very short time, the situation has changed to the contrary.
There is no guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again after a while.
I think Erdogan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
Once he is between two poles, the West and Russia, he will try to gain the maximum benefit for himself," says Muhin.
In his view, the main challenge for the President of Turkey today is to retain political power in the country, which requires Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin in order for the US to stop supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus will be reached with Turkey," the expert believes.
A different view is taken by Anna Glasova, the head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East.
Turkey's relations with both the EU and the US are now quite tense, and this is primarily due to the domestic policies that Erdogan personally pursues.
I believe that this crisis in relations will be exacerbated and, against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reboot policies both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, state that they are prepared to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, that relations with Israel have been settled, and that there is active political engagement with Iran," explained AiF.ru Glasov, suggesting that Erdogan's next step would be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
She said that Erdoğan's current policy was a return to the foreign policy stance followed by Turkey prior to the Arab revolutions.
“It was then that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region on a zero-neighborhood basis.
There have now been very successful visits by the President of Turkey to Russia and to African countries.
This branch of foreign policy will therefore develop and strengthen Turkey's position in both the regional and international arenas," the expert believes.
Glasova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its previous relationship with the EU, the question now is whether the EU will start to respond harshly to Turkey, which can open its borders to migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Strike of junior doctors: Calls for new collective protests
The representatives of the junior doctors asked the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over the new employment contract.
The Junior Physicians Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask its full advice to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says ministers failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the contract of employment agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Helen McCord said the government continued to "controversially remain silent" about the problems she said had led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said, "Considering the situation, the JDC leader voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in its entirety and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues."
In response to the Government's silence, the leader of JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuing programme to expand collective protests, starting early September.
The dispute resulted in young doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
BMA's junior physician leader, Dr. Joan Malawana, resigned after a vote to repeal the agreed terms of the contract that BMA recommended.
He told the BMA members that the deal was good to take, during meetings leading up to the voting of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said this contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: The Bad Alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague to the gilded palace hall in St. Petersburg, I had a strong impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile seemed strained, and he hardly radiated heat even according to his own self-restraint standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in contrast, has repeatedly spoken of his "Dear Friend" Mr. Putin five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, one newspaper described Mr. Erdoğan's actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant otherwise.
But the chilling chill coming from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first reason for the crisis was what he mentioned in his introductory remarks: Turkey hit a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was ferocious.
Mr. Putin broke out with an angry tirade accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The insult was even more severe based on the alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a stunning, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks should be held guilty of everything.
The most serious were accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's own family had profited from the illegal trade in oil from Syrian areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only occurred because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of its kind.
The advantages of declaring an armistice are clear to Ankara.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost ousted from his post last month in an attempted coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him, too.
There's also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring in several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast every year.
The number dropped sharply by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly feel relieved when the flights finally resume.
They put at the peak of the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
Even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Turists there, tomatoes back here," as said in the report in Vedomosti.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for viewing it as a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged dissatisfaction with the tortoise tempo of talks about joining the EU and Mr. Putin's move — which seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support for elected authorities after an attempted coup d'état.
Note that this is a tribute to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So the summit in this brilliant palace on the seaside allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described as a "alyan of bad": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West unite forces.
However, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposing sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after almost three hours of initial talks, while two presidents gave a press conference, they did not even address the subject.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground in Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and given the possibility of a total catastrophe when a NATO member of Turkey hit a Russian jet fighter — it is certainly better that the two leaders at least speak again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland
Brand RBS should be reduced to the role of backing phis, according to the bank's executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the Scottish BBC that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it almost collapsed eight years ago and needed to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies used "RBS" to protect other consumer credit brands.
He was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship of international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for banking services to individuals who will have more influence – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan interviewed during a client and employee tour in Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland, "The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be employed, because we are now becoming more of a bank of brands."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something entirely different in its population, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not be able to continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building a profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
"This is a good time for us to move a bank of brands because at the base (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for clients and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on the needs of clients rather than our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can get those brands back, so I think it's a good time.
Franky Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with a Newmarket win on Condition.
Dettori sprays champagne after a take at Newmarket leads to 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Dettori achieved his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track, on a Tradition trained by John Gosden.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this outstanding mark in smooth racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Iddery, and Willie Carson.
Three-time Dettori jockey champion who had previously won the Guyyar said, "It's something special."
I'm really excited because my family's here, too.
I'm really glad this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big social event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night since 20000 people.
I'm free of business and very uncomplainable.
Dettori accepts applause when he cites Predisposition after victory
Two jockeys have reached this point in racing obstacles: jockey champion Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 wins in a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Franky is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical scheming that distinguishes him from others in the weight room.
He's a great representative for the races, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend jockey and a big race!
And seriously, Frankie's been bringing winners to the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for British racing, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Franky Dettori celebrated this remarkable mark with a brand-new, fast leap off a horse.
From rapid finishes to rapid scraps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth races for two decades.
They were ups and downs.
Many of the winners of the big races, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and stayed in disqualification due to doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after six months of disqualification, but he showed great willpower to challenge skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while yet — Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years of age.
Putin dismisses chief of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly fired his chief of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed representative for the environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin states that Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian President's administration" but did not give a reason.
Deputy Mr. Ivanova from 2012, Anton Vino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Weino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He was later the head of the Office of the President's Protocol and the Cabinet, reporting on the Kremlin's website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task for the administration is to support your activities as head of State in terms of drafting laws and monitoring the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be relieved of his position and recommended that Vino replace him.
Do Smiles Convince?
It's a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was shown on state television, both men stated that the chief of administration had resigned of his own accord.
But despite the smiles on the camera, it convinced few people here — especially now, just before the parliamentary election.
So, these are the unintended consequences of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement — that the man once campaigned for as a potential president, suddenly wanted to govern Russian environmental policy — was met with enormous skepticism.
In Putin's remarks quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It's true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very difficult position, even, you might say, a problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out I've been president's chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he most trusted.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russian president after Putin's second term, as Putin's third term would be unconstitutional.
However, another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, took over the post.
Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson is fired after a fight with producer.
Gibson was part of a fight on the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday, before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences of opinion and opinion.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson's character will be deleted from the show, which follows the FBI agents' team, is expected to be received later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statements.
The 54-year-old actor who had previously played the lead role in Darm and Greg's sitcom was on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love "thinking as a criminal" and put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in his statement published on Friday.
I was hoping to be there to the end, but that's not gonna be possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our wonderful team, and, most importantly, the best fans the show could ever dream of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: The fish landed in Banfa Garden
A man from Banff sought help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bane believes 75 fish could have been sandstones left behind by a waterstorm.
Bane, who lives 500 metres from the sea, posted a shot of this spectacle to Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensland Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers connected the northern passage and Viaduc Quinsperry Crossing – meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four junctions between the painting fans, which are now coming to an end near all three of the bridge's pilons.
The Fife Bridge Section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 vants of bridge.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Quinsperry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to engineering art on a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete have only been used to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the junction between the viaduct and the bridge painting is a virtuoso operation using extremely precise assembly tolerances.
In total, about 79% of the total bridge painting is now in place, for the last section of the painting, concrete coatings are cast in Rosystow today, which means that everything is ready to be lifted up on the bridge site.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first junction on every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this connection is the most modern construction art.
Once the last section of the road painting had been installed and connected to the widening North Pylon road painting, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north, or the shoreward side.
This was done by pushing the viaduct of the northern approach 700 millimeters south.
It was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Large, because the Viaduc is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and should have been raised to an angle of inclination of about 3%.
Fine, because the tolerances the team was working on were tiny — just a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Rescue in Bay Moelfr: Three men 'lucked to stay alive'
Three men were 'lucky to stay alive' after being thrown off a fishing vessel in Anglesi.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised an alarm at 1:20 p.m. British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an incident unfolding in Bay Moelfr.
Three men tried their best to swim to safety while their ship continued its course.
"We saw their ship piling near them and suggesting the worst," said Moelfre's lifeboat pilot Vince Jones.
"Happily, by the time we hit the water, a strong wind had taken him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel and a third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and clutching into a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all brought on board the coastal lifeboat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said, "The three men thrown into the water are lucky they're alive and completely intact.
The boat engine had an emergency breaker, but somehow it got off the man who ran the boat when it fell over.
Someone was guarding these guys today.
Pokémon Go, worthy hunting for health and happiness
It's exciting to see the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go pulls people away from the couch and engages in some physical activity.
The time in the screen was originally limited to television, then video games, and more recently smartphones.
It's so great to see that technology and activity on the street aren't mutually exclusive.
I, of course, refer to the massive fascination that Pokémon Go, an app based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (later the creation of a series of cartoons, playing cards and other branches).
Like many other pop cultural phenomena, all of this was overtaken by events a little earlier than this new game became available in the US, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
Launch in other countries was delayed at the time due to a massive response that overloaded servers.
In a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, smartphone players go looking for Pokémons that are tracked through GPS and, when discovered, can be 'photographed' (through a screenshot on your phone) or 'captured'.
The generation who played the game, being younger, joined the fall of a crush, breaking away from the sofas to search.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in the number of steps that a "normal" person passes daily.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people they track, who performed 30-minute exercises daily, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary level passing data.
Many health campaigns that convince people to "find 30 minutes," "get off the couch" and "be active every day," did not find a response, because most health messages are boring and express themselves to people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of advantages too long to cite here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it pulls people out to do what they love.
Thus, three basics of health are covered: movement, fresh air, and sunlight, and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring bores who are looking for something to complain about.
And, yes, someone might come across the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Because even though smartphone apps like Fitbit might have been able to track our physical activity before, they didn't give us a reason to study, as this game gives us.
The newcomer will sit down, and the use will weaken over time.
However, with Pokemon's success, more games will emerge that will combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Bales wins the gold of the absolute first in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the fuss.
Simone Bales is invincible for all of this.
Dynamic on the back jump.
Uncoerced on a log.
It's amazing on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the champion's absolute first title on Thursday, placing a gap between herself and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under close Olympic scrutiny.
Her overall score of 62.198 was sufficiently far from silver medalist and teammate "Final Five" Eli Reisman and Russian bronze medalist Alija Mustafaina.
Bailles of the United States competes in the gymnast log during the final of the women's individual absolute championship in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bailes became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the championship of the absolute first and fifth overall, establishing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She cried when she showed her final overall score and her long journey to that point ended.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their sports to new heights:
Bayles has spent the last three years dominant in her sport, winning 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold - with such stunning programs in their mix of industriousness and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One final test was waiting in Brazil, the competition not so much between Bailes and the rest of the field, but between it and the cargo of over-expected expectations.
Anything less than going back to his family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an unfulfilled expectation.
Simone Bayles of the United States, on the left, and Eli Reisman are hugged after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual absolute championship in artistic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Bailes earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of the retiring national team coordinator Martha Karoli.
While Bailes insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, she did not.
Part of her free exercise program, the one that includes her signature passage, is set to Latin American music, which would fit just like houses on the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl adopted by her grandfather and grandmother, being a beginner of walking as a child and discovered by coach Amy Burman's mother during a visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She has not lost a single absolute first competition since the summer of 2013, a course of luck that should continue as long as Bailes would like.
Although Mustafaina gained a small advantage with two turns, it was a mirage.
Gymnastic log and free exercise — where Bayles defends the title of world champion — lie in ambush.
She went forward again with 15.433 on the log and finished with 15.933 on the floor.
Riceman gently hugged her while they were waiting for the final account, a pure formality, and tears appeared around a shiny red with white and blue eyeliner for Balles, when the design she once recorded in the clipping album came to fruition.
Rhysman's performance was a small revenge for what happened four years ago, when she divided third, but lost the bronze to Mustafa on a tai break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "grandmother," was far ahead.
She was sending kisses to the crowd after her free exercise, covered by a return that sometimes seemed in question.
As for Bailes, the viral tweet of 19 years old from the beginning of this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the most deadly attack in the case of Phoenix's first serial killer over the past decade, sat in the car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot dead on June 12, when their car was parked on the driveway, stated to the authorities.
The perpetrator fired approximately eight rounds of a pistol standing on the passenger side of the vehicle, after which he fled in another vehicle, reported in the report.
The police claim that the triple homicide does not appear to be the result of the robbery, as the perpetrator did not take the wallets or $2,900 that were at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
A Finix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, stated that the shooting prompted investigators to verify whether he had been involved in the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas within four months.
"It happens in a residential area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the brown Nissan of the late 1990s, black BMW of the late 1990s, and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, the aim of which was an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found casings and retrieved a bullet from the seat and fragments of a bullet from the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old with a microcephalus: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picsivto loves singing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund's microcephaly is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picsivto did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which, in fact, is not true — of course you subscribe to it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized treatment facility.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were still doing that," Picsivto explained.
Edmund walks with walkers.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But it's slowly going through some stages.
He walks with outside help and rides a bike.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund invented for "please sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picsivto CBS News.
But not just ordinary sign language — she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a variety of different circumstances: genetics such as Edmund's, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zeka.
Symptoms and predictions may vary considerably.
It is too early to tell how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zeke virus.
Pixivto recalls emotional losses due to uncertain futures.
Did I keep telling you what would happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't really ask for a lifetime forecast because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picsivto has encouraging advice for mothers of babies with congenital defects due to Zeke.
It's getting better.
You know everything's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding, causing rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state until and including Saturday.
Numerous rivers in south-east Louisiana and south Mississippi have come out of the banks and threaten large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Meteorological Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards stated that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance had already gone to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, stated that requests were being made for transportation for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the parish of Tanjipahoa requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The risk of flooding remains valid until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The Meteo Service said in a statement that an additional 3–5 inches could slip into the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood was on duty until Friday, as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comit River near Baton Rouge and the Eimit River near Denim Springs, both in Louisiana, were predicted to set a flood level record last weekend.
Synoptic Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding going downstream in Assenshen parish was a threat, as these sighing rivers would slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever recorded levels at 9 a.m. Friday morning.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of flooding in the districts of Aimit and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepdaughter were among those rescued early on Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says the Beaver Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, rose quickly overnight.
He said that the other stepson who lived nearby had warned him.
"We woke up, and the water continued to advance," said Hansford.
She's reached my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the biggest tributary she'd seen in 48 years that lived here.
Hansford said he and all the members of his family have a disability, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were sheltered on Friday.
Krautmann says the flood is "quickly spreading" as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering the evacuation order.
Krautmann says that an observer near Livingstone reported a 13.75 inch rain fall from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was oversaturated with rainfall from the environment.
Heavy rain and flooding of the streets led to the rescue of residents from their homes in the parish of Tanjipahoa and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, the authorities state.
WWL, a CBS affiliate, reports that Tanjipahoa's councillor reported 200 flooded houses.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but they're both flooding now.
The parish chairman, Robbie Miller, stated that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets in high water.
Shelters were opened in the city of Aymit and the city of Hammond to receive those who were evacuated.
"They'll have a chance to go home as soon as the water starts to fall," he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tanjipahoa parish, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would retain water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said City Manager Lacey Landrum.
It's on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, Rupert Lacey, head of Emergency Services, reported that the heavy rain continued on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, head of the Shopper Value Foods store in Aimeet, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Tauson said, "and it's still pouring on the ground."
Mahage Brown, 6, "stained with bullets," remains alive after a shooting in Philadelphia.
Police report that a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, recording a second shooting at a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The baby's grandmother and grandfather identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahage Brown.
Grandma and grandfather say Brown suffered numerous gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and stomach, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He suffered badly, his small body was mutilated with bullets," says his grandmother Delores Melendez of the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in hospital in critical condition and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown quarter.
Three men, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old, were also shot.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were reported to be in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The baby was found shot in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting to the station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shootout between several armed men.
The semi-automatic weapons casings attributed to different copies of semi-automatic weapons sprung the scene.
It seems like it was definitely a long battle.
There were casings on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So there appear to have been several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shootout," Philadelphia police captain Anthony Jinaldi reported to the station.
Many homes and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests were made, and the police are reported to be looking at CCTV.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday when playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie?
That's what I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team for several reasons.
First, I've been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, three gymnasts play a key role in this team: Simone Bayles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lory" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Coshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It also strengthened black and Latin American women's presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America applauded.
The world could now witness the incredible performances of the three-time World Championships Simona Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez performing unexpected but nonetheless virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in a women's individual absolute first.
And Eli Reisman's teammate earned silver.
We're witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like it in gymnasiums all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the final five, because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the final year of Martha Karoli's coaching.
But in reality gymnastics is expensive sports, and gymnasts are first trained in private gymnastics clubs supported by parents paying for tuition, equipment, travel, form, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and it's an expensive and long-term duty for gymnast families.
Aimee Burman, coach of Simone Bales, and Maggie Haney, coach of Lori Hernandez, both trained their athletes from the moment they took gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and affordable gymnastics training for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and low-cost gymnastics classes located in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (mostly black and Latin American) and have raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to exhausting work, discipline, and persistence for the mind.
This combination has a positive impact throughout life on good health, school success and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls into gymnastics, and that's wonderful.
Sporting is so important, especially for girls.
It's such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Ali, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for this serious demonstration of the Women's Force in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong, and successful young women.
The junior doctors took on the announcement of further strikes after the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's offer.
Ministers had hoped to complete the change dispute by agreeing on a modified contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who had participated in the vote had rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the treaty, saying that NHS was on "no one's land" and any subsequent delay would cause damage to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes night work changes and weekends to improve out-of-time services.
Dr. Helen McCot, chairman of the Young Doctors' Committee" BMA, said in a statement last night: "Medical doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it feeds the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied fairly to all doctors."
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors are reassigned, progress is needed and time is running out.
WMA's attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to take action and sometimes complete silence on the part of the Government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the fears of junior doctors.
If he doesn't, then junior doctors are clear that they're willing to organize subsequent strikes.
The last strike in late April delayed about 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 nurse appointments, while nurses and consultants were engaged to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
Ministers hoped to end the change dispute by agreeing on an amended contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants a better pay day off for 54,000 junior doctors who will be eligible for the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, encouraged junior doctors not to continue strikes.
Mortimer stated, "The strikes achieve little or nothing, but put pressure on already working teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorder to patients, nurses and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken with the Junior Physicians Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate awareness policies.
Workers hoped that continued positive assistance on other important topics — such as staff distribution, learning flexibility, additional training for those returning after career break, cost of learning, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay differences in medicine — was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Health Department were going to comply with the conditions achieved by VMA in November, February and May.
A 2-pound-a-day drug can reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of patients with heart attacks are going to use the drug for £2 a day, after authorities have recommended it to more people and for longer.
The anti-resistance drug tichellor reduces the risk of re-attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already scheduled for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
NICE's National Health Service surveillance service advised to give it to people for four years to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems from now on.
However, NICE's National Health Service surveillance service now advised to give it to people for four years to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems from now on.
A heart attack occurs with approximately 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of tiles.
If the plaque is torn to pieces, it could cause a clot blocking blood access to the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move along the flow of blood and block the bloodstream to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already experienced one attack are at greater risk of receiving another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of tickegrelore for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said, "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention techniques, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke — often with devastating consequences."
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that the tickeglor, combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
Preliminaryly recommending a ticker, we are pleased to have the opportunity to expand the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of the ticheater — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment beyond that time.
The culture of PC possession allows for the flourishing of vote-counting in Muslim areas
Ex-Mayor Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was suspended last year due to corruption, triggering a government report
The culture of political correctness has led to the closing of eyes, which has resulted in the widespread falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim communities, according to information from the destructive government report released today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is being criticized by the police, election observers and city administrators for ignoring evidence of election irregularities due to "excessive sensitivity about race and religion".
A former community secretary, now an anti-corruption king, reported that religious intimidation of voters was so strong that police needed to be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He proposes that voters take identification cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters must simply state their name and address.
The report even suggests putting permanent ink on people's fingers when they surrender their ballots in order to prevent someone from voting twice.
Better protection should be given to informants, said Sir Eric.
He called on the press to have greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud going hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street due to a ballot scandal at Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor of Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office due to a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "acted his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of the Muslim believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes raised doubts or were the result of a personation when a person votes, introducing himself or herself to someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about the mail fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric, in the photograph, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your identity card to prove who you are.
His report states: “There has been evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote at the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There were fears that ... public institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour due to the excessive sensitivity of `political correctness' to ethnicity and religion."
Cheese Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the removal of political activists from work with postal ballot papers to stop "the harvest of votes."
The report, before Teresa May, also calls for enhanced registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
The option of requiring voters to present an identity card before voting is under consideration.
Use permanent ink on people's fingers as soon as they leave their bulletin to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on the nationality of people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on requests for automatic postal voting.
To suspend political campaign participants and activists from working with completed correspondence votes and postal envelopes.
To empower the police to establish cordons around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation according to the 1983 People's Act.
To make it illegal to take photographs at polling stations.
Require that only English be used at polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff force voters to go to the booth one at a time.
Sir Eric violently attacks the city's police, claiming it's "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal acts," he reported.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful "checks for the tick" of the city administration's electoral registration offices.
Sir Eric stated, "The last year's judgment in the Tower Hamlet was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of the parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and hidden spread of selective fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Crazy about Kate's bike counterpart and other celebrity doubles at the Rio Olympics.
The fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week were crazy about French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who turned out to be impressively like the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic contestant is not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast of her own famous doppelganger — at least according to social media reports.
So, after the Rio Games and all the famous individuals appearing on our screens so far, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who have more than a superficial similarity to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: U.S. male archer team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's double on the bike track, many people online have rushed to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. men's archer team Brady Ellison caused a hurricane on Twitter, after images of him appeared looking frighteningly similar to Wolf's star from Wall Street.
And in fact, the archer found out about the social media madness and admitted that he'd heard that he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
"I personally do not see a huge resemblance, perhaps with the exception of the vegetation on my face," Brady Huffington Post said.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt be indicated even more this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast, Alia Mustavin, with her big, articulate eyes, is said to be an exact copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg has been compared to the star of Glee Club Matthew Morrison for many years.
Turning to the more unexpected: This user believes Nathan is the "sport version" of the Start actor.
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist swimmer from Russia Julius Yefimova can boast not only of the same tanned skin and blond hair as actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the US team, according to fans, looks like a "sport version of Joseph Gorgon Levitte".
Furious Women: Hope Solo Football Star, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, right, have the same shapes of face and eye
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this couple
One Twitter user recently turned to the website to make public his excitement that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
Indeed, the US football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar shapes of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as the winning gold medal of the gymnast Gabby Douglas, who can boast of her own beautiful broad smile, which resembles the smile of the star "A successful" Gabriel Union.
Olympiad commentator at CBC apologizes for saying about the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of fourth place at the finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan on a women's freestyle 4x200 m relay outraged CBC viewers on Wednesday in a live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started as a stench" and "died as a pig" during the swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he started expressing his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200 m freestyle relay.
You could hear MacDonald being drawn to the CBC comment team to "dilute it in color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, started like a stink, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ay Yanhan, who is 14 years old, sailed the second stage of the relay in 1:57.79–1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and the expressions used
Emmet McFarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China 'dead as a pig'?"??"
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
On Ay Yanhan of China, in the final of the 4x200 m women's relay, the freestyle was said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby."
Twitter criticism immediately hit Byron McDonald, with many calling for his dismissal
Twitter users didn't stop when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Whoa #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was broadcasting CBC, apologized live for McDonald's comment, saying, 'We're sorry for the comment about the swimming performance being aired.'
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
IFOR concluded with an apology to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement
Commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on McDonald's behalf.
CBC then copied and sent their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
The network also rushed to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to our live viewers and our social media subscribers.
To be clear, Byron's comments referred to the swimmer's performance, not to her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, stating that he did not think his words would be interpreted as an attack on a person.
'I'd like to take the moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay,' he said at the CBC Olympic Games broadcast.
'I was talking about the swimmer's performance, not her in person.'
'It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I'm sorry.'
Primark's buyer insulted a woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of a store.
Buyers didn't know where to look when some woman was naked to try on panties, on floors with shops in the middle of Primark.
Worse, she tried on how she looked in them, pulled them down and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkston.
Primark shop at the Bouverie Place mall in Falxton, where a woman tried on knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson's mother, who was in the store at the time, said that after dressing her underwear, a mysterious woman again "dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the shopping room, she took a pair of panties off the window, took off her own tights and panties and put them on.
"She didn't try to find somewhere private to do it -- she just stood there, shameless."
"Everybody was staring when she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing to three other couples before she finally decided there was nothing here that she liked, dressed again and went out.
"It doesn't look like she cared who was watching her, or that she thought of the man who would eventually buy those panties she was trying on."
33-year-old Jenny Davidson of Kent, said, "It's disgusting to think someone's going to take home the underwear someone else was already wearing, and they weren't washed."
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I draw the conclusion that the staff apparently tried to remove these clothing items from the sale after she left — much better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of women's underwear and find another woman wearing and filming them, and they weren't washed."
Primark's spokesman reported, "Primark knows about an incident that happened at our store in Falxton on Tuesday August 9.
All the goods in question had been withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks using krav-maga
The world around here is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Misraci, Master of the Crava Maga Federation in New York City, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether it comes to you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapons.
If you come from behind, according to Misrashi, the first thing you have to do is turn around so that you can see the attacker and 'free the line of fire'.
Then you squeeze the gun tightly between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
The knee then follows in the groin, and while the attacker bends in pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, you stab him in the face with a barrel, and you step back holding the weapon pointed at him.
For an armed man coming from the front, the way to do it is the same -- get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun quickly, and pull it out so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip before you step back and target him.
Does it sound complicated?
Take a look at the video to see exactly how Misradi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery is if you're not Master Crava Maga is to give away your cash.
For a guide, traveler Jan Wright spends his language on the dirtiest places in Europe.
The British traveler subjected his immune system and vomit reflex to a serious test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Leading and author of travel books Jan Wright, 51, from Saffolk, ran a euro note in his language, the Tsirk Piccadili rails, the toilet wash button on the train and the Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking every object, he used the luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is going to be a film called Traveler-Lizun Guide to the Inner Force, has produced some amazing results.
The thought of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of others may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his tour of Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and medical staff about the increase in intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the licks brought him any more than the bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known through tests of his bowel strength, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railings at the train stations to the toilet wash button, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In the film he made, he said, 'I've been completely careless to my health since I was a kid, and I've dragged a lot of things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he gave up was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test swab showed a luminometer value greater than 4,000 units.
In comparison, just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet he refused to lick after his luminometer value was over 4,000, while just washed hands show less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio filmed a traveler film called the Guide to the Inner Force by Journey-Lizun, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet.
In the film, he said, 'It's close to one of the worst things I've ever smelled in the toilet.'
There's nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
"Travector-Lizun's Guide to the Inner Force" was filmed with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains acid-milk bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and develop the immune system.
The senior vice president of Valio for snacks, juices, and new categories, Nico Voorenmaa said, 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brain assault that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They claim that the interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of bowel health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added: 'Let's say I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film.'
Naturally, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were rather rigid.
I'm glad we managed to film some of these licks.'
In a survey conducted in 2015 by Valio, 84 per cent of respondents linked acid-milk bacteria exclusively to the good state of the stomach and bowel, and 58 per cent said that they used, at least sometimes, products containing added acid-milk bacteria.
The hooligan family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall Municipal House, on the eve of the eviction.
The hooligan family left their municipal home with a 50,000-£ loss after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were kicked out of their real estate facility in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from a real estate facility, shocked officials of housing cooperatives found the property in a state of repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were opened, garbage was sprinkled on the floor and graffiti were dirty on the walls.
The family has now been relocated and is believed to live in a private apartment
Donna McEvoy, a resident at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid she couldn't save him.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are many things to weigh because this real estate facility is likely to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their name has a bad name.
The couple had three sons who lived in a real estate facility from time to time, and police report that the kingdom of horror caused by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, controversy and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for anti-social behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house that could be demolished, they found old trash.
The floorboards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were pulled out.
Neighbors say they saw fights in the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from her home this week, after being granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
Evictions were welcomed with relief by neighbours who said that their lives had been turned into living hell.
One said, 'They didn't care about anyone.'
We've lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
'This morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because it was so quiet, we're not used to it!
Now that they've finally left, everything's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing neighborhood group, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in a house for 20 years, with the police, and they regularly called the police.
Garbage and old toys were scattered below the overgrown side of the municipal house
He added: 'It is a disgrace that the tenant was unable to accept any responsibility for the behavior of her and her family, as eviction is always the last method of action to be considered by Cornwall Housing.
It was a very complicated case, as the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have been terrifying to her observant neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police, and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done bravely to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to neighbours and signal that asocial behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all slightly over 20.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
The settlement workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage that surrounds the house.
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, as well as scales, related supplies and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs for delivery.
She stated that the money went to pay for the tombstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is reported that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
Many of the house's walls were covered with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they'll try to evict tenants who don't comply with the lease rules.
Angela Crowe, of Devon and Cornwall Police, stated that this eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'It's a message to those who feel they can behave without the prosecutor's charges, as well as to those who are harmed by such behaviour' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be tolerated by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a low-flying warplane almost touched the beach.
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to sleep in the sun were terrified of their lives.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low.
Air Force reported that he was on a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk.
This is the moment when frightened tourists start panicking, while the moment when a low-flying plane matches over a crowded beach.
Dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying almost a distance from hunters on a strip of sand to Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Recreational ones jumped on their feet as soon as they became understandably concerned about the noise of the aircraft's engines, but were unable to see what was moving towards them through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the town of Aveiro in Kosta Nova.
Daniel Fernandesh, one of several vacationers who published a video of shocking passages on social media, said, "He flew quite low twice, and there was a moment, at some point, it seemed like he was going to crash."
Nuno Arroža added, "I was surfing and I swear, it felt like the plane was about to fall on me."
Tourists on Aveiro Beach were terrified when the plane appeared out of fog and flew at extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast, and was forced to descend so low as it was the only way to verify them.
The pilot stated that the aircraft had flown slightly lower than usual due to a lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the Portuguese mainland and killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low because of the circumstances — thick fog and smog from the forest fires that made the visibility worse.
The plane was on a training flight, and the pilot was instructed to locate fishing boats as part of the mission
The HASSP system has been mandatory for all meals for over a year, but most of Petersburg's cafes and restaurants have not yet introduced it.
Checks are getting stronger, and businesses are facing fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For over a year now, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HACSP) - risk analysis and critical control points - are mandatory for the use of food by producers and carriers, as well as catering companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
In February 2015, the Rospornadzor business began to be tested for compliance with these standards in Petersburg.
But so far, officials only issue fines for certain breaches of regulations (see List of documents...).
The failure to comply with the regulations in general would cost the enterprise 600,000 roubles for the first offence and 1 million roubles for the second.
HASSP, as a system that takes into account and prevents risks in food handling, came up in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about the safety of food for astronauts.
The system is now used in all food industries not only in the United States, but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, HACSP has been operating in TC territory.
Business had four years to develop and implement the system (the HASSP requirement appeared in TC regulation in 2011).
However, both employers and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we were convinced for a long time that the rule concerned only food production and not restaurants, as explained by Elena Cereteli, head of the Public Council.
Now everyone's trying to catch up.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August, beginning of September.
But they're not going to make a big deal of it, because their target audience, families with children, is already getting ready for school, experts point out.
The Tourist Alliance sent a letter to the government yesterday asking for permission for charters already.
“For many Russian tourists, the issue of finding quality and affordable sea recreation is unsettled, as most of the accommodation facilities at the resorts of Krasnodar Krai and the Republic of Crimea are already booked until the end of September”, the authors point out that the opening of charters in August will not significantly affect the already established demand for Russian maritime tourism products.
As reported at the Northwest Regional Office of the Russian Touring Union (RTA), if Russian and Turkish aviation authorities quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding as to when the charts will be resumed does not yet depend primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even August, if tour operators quickly build programs and arrange with airlines for the required ships," says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director of Communications and International Projects of the Northwest Regional Office of the RST.
According to him, a possible resumption of charters is good news, but it will not affect market power too much, because the main buyers of charter tours, families with children, have already returned from rest and are preparing for school or are taking leave in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are bought mostly by single travellers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously," says Paul Rumyansev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract many tourists if it now makes very budget proposals - 50,000 to 60,000 rubles per tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of the Optio-Travel travel agency.
Otherwise, there's no need to count on the jigsaw - the bulk of the travel has already been planned.
Paul Rumyantsev also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, the charterers will also be needed, but there is no need to wait.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal of the next season," says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"The opening of charters to Turkey is positive news for the next season," says Valeria Rubtsova.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from the NPFL of statutory compensation payments within the limits of the approved rules relating to compensation for injury or other impairment of health.
The distribution of milk to workers working in harmful conditions is provided for under article 222 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
However, the rules and conditions for extradition are established by Ministry of Health and Social Development Order No. 45n of 16 February 2009.
According to this document, the free distribution of milk or other equivalent foods is made to workers on the day of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions due to harmful working factors.
On the basis of these rules, the Russian Federal National Service, in the letter under consideration, concluded that, on the basis of article 217, paragraph 3, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, income in the form of the cost of milk given to workers on the days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions was exempt from the imposition of the NDFL, in accordance with the Regulations and Conditions approved by Ministry of Health and Development Order No. 45n of 16 February 2009.
The Moscow Gazstroybank was not licensed to the CB.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia withdrew the bank transaction licence from a credit organization, the Association Commercial Bank “GASTROYBANK”, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, GASTROIBANC had a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of money in low-quality assets.
An adequate assessment of the risks involved at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank ' s assets have resulted in the credit organization having a basis for anti-banking measures.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in questionable transit operations.
A temporary administration has been appointed in the bank until the date of appointment to the competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization are suspended under federal laws.
GASTROIBANC ACS is a member of the deposit insurance system.
It should be recalled that the payment of insurance compensation to the bank's depositors, including individual entrepreneurs, is provided for in Federal Act No. 177-FZ on the insurance of the deposits of natural persons in banks of the Russian Federation in the amount of 100 per cent of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million roubles in total.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will start no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the accounts, the value of the assets of the GASTROIBANC ACS was 335th in the Russian Federation's banking system as of 1 August 2016.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIL died in Syria
Kadiza Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIL, reportedly died in Syria.
Counsel Tasnim Akunji stated that her family had learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died from a Russian air strike in Raqqa, a group stronghold in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
Sultane was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave a war-torn country and return to England.
"It is only to be hoped that the only advantage of all this is as a tombstone and a will to others, that these are precisely the risks involved when travelling to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making the same choice," Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other schoolgirls from eastern London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family was told that she married an ISIL fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reed states that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge if elected
Democratic leader in the Senate Harry Reed says he is convinced that a democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court if elected as President.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland's claim, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Majority team leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next president will select the person who can replace the last Supreme Court judge, Antonin Scalia.
Reid stated at a conference call on Thursday that he predicts Clinton will choose Garland "with some degree of confidence."
Representative Reed later said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and she was just making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to rock the boat with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Reed has stated that the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are the "catchers" and "assistants" of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He stated that Trump was not suitable for the position.
Treats states erotic calendars for 'women as well as men'
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli of the 1970s.
But instead of nude celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with nude museums.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I make it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is the same.
"We need to go back to demonstrating an eternal and classical nude figure where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can serve photographs online or in person on open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Moskwich will be given memos about unscrupulous internet stores.
Moscow is about to issue a memo that will tell you how not to become a victim of an Internet store.
This was reported in Rospornadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that the agency's specialists are preparing a memo that will help citizens to choose the Internet store correctly and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of the brochure includes several sections.
These will be general information and a legislative framework, rules for the delivery of goods, and ways to protect their legitimate rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to properly draft the claim and so on," explained in Rospandazor.
The memo is currently being finalized.
It will subsequently be posted on Rospornadzor's website in Moscow, and it is also planned to issue a print version and distribute to the Moscows.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement in which it named the second suspect in the organization of a diversion in Crimea.
Persons from Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts have been detained.
These include Panov Evgeny Alexandrovich and Zahthei Andrei Romanovich.
"They're all confessing," says the report.
Earlier, a resident of Zaporizh region, Evgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, pleaded guilty to interrogation.
FAS will fine Google 438 million rubles.
The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine of 438 million roubles on Google Corporation, as stated on the agency's website.
" Google fine for antimonopoly violation was 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine soon," stated FAS deputy chief Alexei Docenko.
During the investigation, FAS found that Google supplied smartphone manufacturers, which were sold on Russian territory, a Google Play application store only on condition that the device would be fitted with other corporate applications.
Among these applications is a search engine to be installed on the main smartphone screen.
Thus, the corporation violates article 10, paragraph 1, of the Competition Protection Act (abuse of dominance).
We are confident that enforcement will provide an opportunity to develop competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a beneficial effect on our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act must be respected by all companies whose products are being delivered to the territory of the Russian Federation and transnational corporations, among others, as pointed out by the head of the Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Authority of the Russian Federation, Elena Zaeva.
The department suspects the conspiracy of 16 Russian stores.
The New Bookshop network was fined for selling the book 50 Days Before My Suicide.
The New Bookshop chain is fined for selling Stace Kramer's 50 Days Before My Suicide book, reports the Moscow City News Agency.
According to Rospornadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book may be regarded as “incitement or motivation for the suicidal behaviour of children and adolescents”.
The Remand District Court confirmed the violation of the prescribed requirements for the distribution of information products to children and ordered a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of the printed matter arrested by the Rosppnadzor Administration.
The source at the New Bookshop confirmed that it was about Stace Kramer's work.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookstores in Moscow were being tested for a book entitled "50 Days Before My Suicide".
In Moscow, there will be a memorial night for Ernst the Unknown.
There will be a sculptor Ernst the Unknown's memorial night in Moscow, reports TASS.
The event will take place on August 15 at the Central House of Letters.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say good-bye to the Unknown in the United States in person.
So it was decided to host this evening for those who want to remember it on their native land," said the Russian Jewish Congress Press Service.
They said it was important for the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the Unknown are invited to the evening, including poet Evgeny Evtusenko, painter Boris Messererer, president of the Pushkin Irina Antonov GMI, director Mark Rosovsky, as well as Russian Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinski, head of the Moscow Department of Culture Alexander Kibovsky, deputy mayor of Moscow Leonid Pchetnikov.
It was previously reported that Ernst Unknown's relatives were planning to hold a memorial on a sculptor in New York City, presumably before 14 August.
The end consumer blamed: Who actually buys records?
Lone middle-aged men love vinyl.
And until you start clogging the comment section with gross insults under the pseudonym Not All Men Middle Summers, this allegation comes from the facts.
According to YouGov, so much of the record revival discussed is due not to a boom among a generation of 2,000 who want to penetrate a novel material subject, but to the nostalgia of the middle years.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high probability are between the ages of 45 and 54, according to data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It is also not just an act of gathering amateurs - it has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to hold their feelings (56% versus 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% versus 66%).
But are the YouTube results correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would have followed me while I was walking around the center of Soho's busy street, in a modest gray suit and brutely gesture before stopping, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, "Well, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Soho's heart slowly loses its charm and mud — hotels, cafes, Papershase stores have now flooded buildings once occupied by independent sellers — several music stores with fantastic experts still remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to various people in some of these stores and trying to assess their age and emotional attitude through observation.
A native of Glasgow Stewart, 55 years old, followed by me from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20), in London for half a day to meet, and walks around the shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I suppose so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, depicted above (he sent me an e-mail of a picture, I didn't chase him home), are lined up the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring so many albums and singles is partly derived from his disposable income: he can now buy records that he could not afford when they first came out, and buy back the items he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many of what I acquire is the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are likely to be introverts that like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
It's my fault.
Wes, 25 years old, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets correspond to YouTube's profile.
He noticed, however, a new wave of people influenced by media noise, people who heard about their return and felt the obligation to buy back their old records.
Based on the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records," he says.
This may explain the boom among rebirthists of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of records?
It's enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wes, some older clients, in particular, are insulted by a cashless pay system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel shock from the digital world and prefer to move away into the constant of familiar record envelopes, objects that awaken memories of a serenityful youth.
"I think sometimes it can be filling the void or possessing material things as a kind of calm," Wes says.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it, too.
It's a simple way to keep your head occupied.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the record rack.
An ICM poll in April showed that almost 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The poll also found that 41% had a player they never used, while 7%, of those who buy vinyl, did not have a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously puzzled, slitting through a tablet with Bosanóv’s collections.
"The Trophy" aspect of revival is what Johnny, 42, observed working at Sounds of the Universe.
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it in the shelf," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More of a piece, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older, just under 20 who just get to know it.
Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire floor of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples over 70, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores – the last synth and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation – breaks through columns – it is nice to see diversity in its customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but a painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish standing 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleanor, 27, walked on the Fop for a few minutes, looking at various records available on sale.
She's looking at the goods, not spending money.
She doesn't make much, she says, so it's not a good option to collect records.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of the vinyl is...," she plunges into dreams with a sigh, filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl amateurs: City fashioners.
While I'm creating the illusion that I'm looking at the jeans-bound shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gather around Polaroid's camera every minute before father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of the Crosley player.
On the left is a ladder, the wall of which is tired of the records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mack: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory records for any medium collection.
No one is looking — perhaps because they are just jewelry, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real art vinyl.
But, given that any focus on these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to Soho's depths for a while, there's hardly anything to complain about.
It is no wonder that a segment of the population that is more likely than most have more time and money than most is the one that spends most of the money on luxury items such as vinyl.
But as long as my findings indicate that YouTube results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they do not rule out the existence of an enormous number of women collectors and vinyl lovers who exist in reality, in record stores, and on online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or offices.
But they obviously don't spend Thursday morning walking around record stores on Berwick Street, slitting records and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake host who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland Polar Shark — The Longest Living Vertebrate — A Video Report
Scientists claim that Greenland's polar shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, states that the female's record set her age between 272 and 512 years and five metres long.
The French court rejects the proposal to demolish shops in the Jungle refugee camp
The French court rejected the Calais authorities' proposal to demolish dozens of homemade shops and restaurants in the Jungley camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At this week's court hearings, Kale authorities stated that the State should be able to demolish a total of 72 homemade shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40r) or simple meals for several euros in homemade restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais said that these places should be demolished because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and health risks.
Humanitarian teams told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, claiming that free meals offered by pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing population in the camp.
They said that home stores and restaurants often provided shelter and free food to those in need.
Lille's court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel people running 72 home stores, but stated that Kale Prefecture's problems were “fully understandable”.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much greater role than merely feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the spaces provided quiet places for refugees and volunteers to meet.
One of the places that was threatened with demolition was the children's cafe Book of Jungley at the camp, which works for no gain and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and shelter advice for hundreds of vulnerable minors unaccompanied at the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not older than eight years old."
Two charities, Assistance to Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungley camp had increased to over 9,000, the highest ever, after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Libraries of neighborhoods invite young freemen to study programs.
This week, the branch libraries will hold meetings commemorating City Day, Russian Film Year, and even Physical Education Day.
The programs are child-oriented, so most of them will be in play form.
Today, August 10, the branch library No. 2, in a floody neighborhood, invites "The city is small" to a cruise presentation.
August 11th at the No. 1 library, there'll be a provincial hour "I live in this city, I know this town."
There will be a multimedia lesson on the same day at the No. 2 library.
And in the No. 4 library in Surajevka, the film, film, film game program.
On Sunday, August 14, for the boys from the northern neighborhood, the branch library No. 3 will host a game program called "Phiscult Hello!".
Britain stops at rugby-7 silver after Fiji's master class allows them to take gold
The United Kingdom's impressive series at Rugby-7 was severely stopped at the final obstruction by the Fiji team in the final on Thursday night, when they were completely defeated 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji has given a master class in ball ownership, grazing, evasion, game support, line runs, and rough power to win gold, their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor solace in silver, Britain's third in a day, and they could be proud of their efforts in the first rugby 7 Olympic tournament, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were defeated along the way.
The sick beating of Boxs, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier that day, could have returned to negatively affect them in the final.
But despite everything, Fiji in this form won the best possible 15-man team.
This may be some consolation for the UK – but probably not – that at least one British will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach is Ben Ryan, former England chief from Wimbledon.
It was a little trip for the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
These blows will cause pain, but progress is remarkable.
Fiji started off brilliantly, for fun, battling Britain's attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osei Collinsau dived into the corner.
Having four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuway added another touchdown on the right flank, which was realized.
120 and the UK barely touched the ball.
A magnificent attempt to intercept Mitchell deterred the mountain man Leon Nakaravu from scoring a third, but this only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another after resumption and there was still more than a minute on the clock... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through a few more sluggish attempts to intercept the UK and stormed the line to get a point.
Implementation led to a 29-0 break.
It looked as if Fiji had been born to play rugby 7, while Britain was still mastering the craft.
Which, to a large extent, is true.
The United Kingdom was making mass replacements for half the game, and they blocked the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which by the standards of the first half was good until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton captured an attempt for the UK by making a touchdown in the left corner to score 36-7, but the game long ago followed the way of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on stands.
The full joy of Fiji’s approach was not to be admired.
Mata William decorated the Fijian cake, which did not need embellishment, with another attempt in the last seconds.
A whistle was heard, Fijians hugged, and Britain fell on a lawn completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-finals, and the United Kingdom slightly bypassed South Africa in a tense semi-final of one attempt each, a difference in British implementation.
Kyle Brown brings the Boxes forward in the first half, but Dan Norton with some magnificent footwork broke the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
A brilliant last attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, a brother 15 to England's team, Anthony, secured a victory – and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the rowing coach's battle against cancer.
There'll be no more exciting gold at these games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy climbs into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional meaning of their golden moment on the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three votes in this boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always while they sought second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sports to reach that height.
Their superiority was absolute, eventually it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes rolling on the surface with swan elegance do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind each gold rowing, a battalion of ready hands contributing to gradually increasing victories that mattered, and there were no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know whether he would live to see that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
This could be a pretty bad situation.
It changes your outlook a little bit for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was lucky that he could start treatment early in 2014 in the off-season, keeping the break in schedule minimal if it could be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed payment, so I needed to recover quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital walking around the office -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said there were enough steps.
That's how it starts.
The ridge itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
The moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, captain of the artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind her shoulders, said, "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It only confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin, too.
It's been fantastic for three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner to train or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
This couple sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even on the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark's teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much to spare.
We were in a lot of phase.
Helen called: 'Stay in the process, stay in the process'.
It's very important not to get carried away right now.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do anything amazing.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to row well and come out and win this race, which we did.
It's gonna take a couple a year to figure out their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, at her own with television adventurer Steve Backscholl.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
The Government has extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctions products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the deadline for the destruction of food prohibited for entry into Russia.
The decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against the countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was imposed in our country in August 2014.
The ban was subsequently extended several times, now in force until December 31, 2017.
It is prohibited to import certain agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the countries of the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
The recycling of food imported into the country in circumvention of the embargo has been under way in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of banned products were withdrawn from sale.
Hunting for "prohibited"
Rains and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
An atmospheric front will pass through the metropolitan region that will bring rainfall and lower air temperatures.
The air will warm up to 25 degrees by day.
For example, on Saturday night, there will be short-term rain in Moscow, possible thunderstorms and gusts of up to 15 m/s.
Rain is expected by day with thunderstorms and wind gusts up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also predicted in Orlov, Kursk and Voronezh oblasts, reported to Days.ru.
Next work week, the rainfall is unlikely.
The WTO Panel of Arbitrators found Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil to be contrary to the rules of the organization.
Import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia upon accession to the WTO.
"This is the first time the WTO has made a decision against the FM," says the report on the organization's official website.
However, the arbitrators emphasized in their opinion that the European Union had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures were “systematic” or “comprehensive”.
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is mentioned in the report of the Ministry of Development of Russia.
On 4 July, it was reported that Kiev intended to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which had imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Government of Ukraine.
In May, Financial Times wrote that U.S. behavior in resolving disputes at the WTO undermined the organization's principles of discussion.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members due to the refusal of the Americans to approve South Korean judge Jang Song Hwa for a second term.
Therefore, Russia will not address the WTO on the question of Western sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now comprises 162 countries.
Russia joined in 2012.
In the President's administration, there was a change of leader.
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed former Deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vino as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin reshuffled the President's administration and expressed the hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Weino, during the meeting, stated that he considered the anti-corruption work he had begun as President Ivanov's chief of staff to be important and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Previously, News has written that experts consider the situation of Sergei Ivanov's resignation as head of administration to be transparent and understandable, and reshuffle would not fundamentally alter the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader, who worked for the President's administration for a long enough time, has left, has effectively built the activities of the AP.
He was replaced by Deputy Chief of Administration Anton Weino, a man who is well aware of the nature of this work.
Poland admits they won't buy fuel from Gazprom.
The State-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that in a few years the supply of gas from the Russian Federation may become unattractive to it due to the shift to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the vice-president of the Polish Finance Company Boguslav Majec.
His words are conveyed by TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (from Gazprom), we are now diversifying our deliveries.
Within the next four years, the main supply lines for us will be the East, LNG terminal raw materials and Norway," said Majec.
Gazprom currently dominates the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, which is 30 per cent higher than the 2015 level.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG procurement increased to 49.8 per cent, compared with 40 per cent a year earlier.
It will be recalled that on 22 July Poland's competition agency did not agree on the establishment of a joint venture between Gazproma and its European partners in the construction of the Northern Flow-2 gas pipeline.
This month, Poland had previously left Gazprom's request for 11 billion cubic metres of gas for Northern Flow 2.
This was stated by Alexander Medvedev, Vice-President of the Holding Board.
The North Flow 2 auction will take place in 2017, and an auction is scheduled to take place in the fall of 2016 for its stowage.
At the end of May it was reported that Gazprom had not yet planned to take any action on the Polish side's intention to abandon long-term gas contracts from Russia after 2022, the Vice-Chairman of the board of Alexander Medvedev stated.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, Poles had only increased the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation by 42 per cent.
Gazprom's deputy added that the mere fact of filing a Polish PGNIG application with the Stockholm Arbitration Tribunal did not yet mean the termination of the negotiations.
The Polish company had previously turned to the court to obtain a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
Let us recall that the Polish Government's Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, Peter Naimsky, the Polish government’s official for gas and energy infrastructure, said that his country could stop supplying blue fuel from the east in six years.
He said Warsaw planned to build a new liquefied natural gas supply terminal, Baltic Pipe, which would connect the country to the Norwegian shelf.
The Northern Flow-2 provides for the construction of two sea pipeline lines with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany on the seabed of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMS) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine ' s border with Crimea.
This was reported by Alexander Hug, the first SMM title in Ukraine.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this field," he said, responding to a relevant question from journalists, transmits "RIA News".
According to OSCE, the situation on the border between Ukraine and Crimea is calm and there are no security incidents.
The observers monitored the events at three crossing points across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a Yak-42 passenger plane landing at Ufa airport appeared on the Network, which rolled out of the runway by 400 metres and fell into the left wing.
The video was released on Channel 360.
The emergency occurred at 4:30 Moscow time.
Crasavia flight has arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to safety, no casualties.
The aircraft itself were being transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport is operating in normal mode.
The Volga Transport Investigation Directorate of the SCR has been investigating the reason for the heavy landing of the liner aircraft.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Stephen de Mistura, considers the fact to be undeniable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, which are scheduled to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have initiated an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on a toxic gas attack, suspected chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
At that time, the opposition stated that in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down the previous day, the aircraft dropped poison bombs, but in Moscow the accusations were described as throwing.
The Russian Ministry of Defence later accused the opposition group Harakat Noor al-Din al-Zinki of what had happened.
It soon became known that there were two toxic gas bombs.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, I started to burn my eyes, it became difficult to breathe," quotes the publication of the eyewitness's word.
At least 7 people died in the attack, and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the action will be considered a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told journalists, "The evidence that this really happened is a lot."
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is stipulated in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict denied the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of chlorine used by the Syrian army against “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo made it difficult for its areas to be shelled daily and for terrorists to prevent residents from leaving the city.
As Reuters conveys, the United Nations expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in military action.
The current three-hour daily quiet regime in the organization is considered “inadequate to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped”.
Staffan de Mistura's Humanitarian Adviser, Jan Egeland, stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to transport the sick and wounded to the city each week.
"We have to send bulk cargo from a column of trucks in an area where the roads are almost destroyed and those left are mined," said Mr. Egeland. "But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” are ongoing.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle over Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia, on 11 August, announced the establishment of a three-hour cessation of hostilities regime, which will operate daily starting on Thursday.
The creation of humanitarian windows is intended to ensure that medicines, food and basic necessities are delivered to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation was taken against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow to dismantle the military operation and to facilitate the resumption of the negotiation process.
A series of explosions at Thai resorts killed four people.
Just a few explosions went off in the south of Thailand on Friday morning.
Four people were killed in the attack, and 19 were injured.
The epicenter of the explosions came to Hua Hin town.
Ten foreigners, nationals of four States, were among the victims, and no Russians were among them.
No terrorist groups have yet claimed responsibility for the incident, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs has rushed to state that Islamists are not involved.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of causing the bombings.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military in charge of the country.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in Phuketa and Hua Hing, Trang and Surat Tani.
After the military junta took power in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been apprehended, as reported by Police Colonel Crisan Patanacharoin.
He added that it was too early to speak about the objectives, but that in the Ministry of Internal Affairs the country was “sure that they were not linked to international extremist groups”.
It's too early to draw conclusions, Mr. Patanacharoin said.
But we know for a fact that these incidents are not directly linked to any kind of terrorism, they are actually local sabotages, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
The bombings took place on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy to be one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely directed against it.
According to Police General Sithic Srisopacharoinrat, the bombs were detonated remotely, with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets filled with restaurant dinner tourists.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who sold street food.
The identities of the remaining victims are not yet known, but they are known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, these include four German citizens, three Dutch nationals, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen.
Russians are not among the victims of the bombings, as reported by Rosturism Press Service.
Local experts also link the explosions to the 7 August referendum, in which 61.4 per cent of the population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitution-making commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role in the election of the country's Prime Minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Let us recall that a military coup took place in Thailand on 22 May 2014 under the leadership of the country ' s army commander, Prayat Chan-Ocha.
In that step, he said, the army had provoked an ongoing political crisis and a lack of progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, and dispersed the protesters and the upper house of Parliament.
How Bangkok was in a State of Emergency
The Thai Government, led by Premier Yinglak Chinawat, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
It's like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred in downtown Bangkok at the Victory Monument, where a major protest took place, in which 28 people were injured, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions were caused by unknowns on motorcycles.
The authorities reinforced security measures in the capital and engaged military forces to protect demonstrators.
The development of conditions has begun in Dry Loga.
As IA has become known, the Government has been asked to agree on draft terms for the Dry Log goldfield auction with two key restrictions.
It is proposed that companies with 25 per cent or more of foreign ownership and those with no minimum 25 per cent of public participation be excluded from the auction.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players already do not risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction could be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Nature has submitted to the Government a draft order and terms of auction for the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, Dry Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), and has shared two sources of "IJ" familiar with the situation.
The draft was introduced on Wednesday evening and clarified one of them.
The Department of Nature has confirmed that the project has been submitted to the government.
Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Chloponin's spokesman for the sub-use control said "IU" that the project had not yet entered the office.
“An auction may be announced as early as August, immediately after the Government's order has been issued, and in view of the deadline for the collection of applications by potential participants (at least 45 days), a tender may be held as early as October”, they say at the Ministry of Nature.
According to IA, the project retains two key requirements for potential participants, as set out in the version that was sent to ministries and FOIV in July (iA).
The first is the presence of at least 25 per cent of the applicants in capital.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on foreign investment in strategic societies.
According to the two articles of the draft, FZ, as IJ already wrote on 2 August, may prevent companies whose beneficiaries (25 per cent of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, since Dry Log is of federal significance (stocks of over 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Nature has confirmed that the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies” but refused to comment on details prior to the Government's order.
The demand for State participation in the auction participants' capital was advanced by the Irkutsk Oblast, said "I" in December 2015 at the Ministry of Nature and later confirmed by the Governor of the Region, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor, Sergei Eroshchenko, "who had agreements on investment projects with Rosteh".
Those who lobbied the alien tolerance limit don't specify I.
"But it's in the spirit of time: don't give control to the largest gold field in Russia against the background of Western sanctions," says the interlocutor, who is familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donskaya, stated on August 1 that foreigners “may join a consortium” if the applicants attract them “as a financial entity, a technology partner”.
"I" interviewers don't think it's likely that the government will adjust the terms.
The main contender for Dry Log in the industry is the consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation PAO Polus, under the control of Suleiman Kerimov's son Said, and Rostheh.
As I wrote, in July, the partners created the SP SL Gold, where the Pole has 51% shares, and the RT-G's "Rosteh" structure has 49%.
In the Rosteh, the comment was dropped, the Pole said "I" that it was "unconditionally interested in this asset" and had all the necessary competences and resources to develop it.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the conditions are announced," added the Pole.
ALROSA may be involved in the auction, but the decision behind the Russian government was said to be "I".
The possibility of participating in the Dry Log development was claimed by Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, developing assets on Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to IA, are not interested in the asset.
The head of the RF Gold Industry Union, Sergei Kashuba, estimated the "I" investment in Dry Log in December 2015 at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants discourage not only the level of investment but also the complexity of the project: there is a need for serious evidence of stocks and technologies for dealing with complex ores, explaining IO's interlocutors in the industry.
In the pension market, the largest M&A deal, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, launched the process of bringing together the four NPFs under control.
As a result, a NPF with savings of about 373 billion roubles will be established on the basis of the Pension Savings Gaz Fund.
The launching of the merger of four pension funds - KIT Finance, Promgrofund, Heritage and Gaz Fund Pension Savings - was reported yesterday by the owner of 100 per cent of KIT Finance Pension Administrator funds.
“Reorganization shall be carried out in agreement with the Central Bank, subject to the requirement that the terms of the contracts in force shall not be affected”, the company's report states.
The merger is based on the Pension Savings Gaz Fund.
As the NPF CEO, Oleg Bialoshitsky, notes, the pooling of funds has several objectives: expanding the geography of the presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
He said that the target date for completion of the consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of the NPF, Gaz Fund Pension Savings will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As at 31 March, the pension savings of the unifying funds exceeded 373 billion roubles.
According to the accounts on the funds' website, the beneficiaries of their ownership, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (65 per cent owned by the LLC) and Gazfund NPF (35 per cent).
However, the group itself launched the competitors much later.
For example, under the control of O1 NPF Future, Stahlfund had been absorbed by the beginning of the year.
This joint NPF is currently joining Uralsib and the Russian Standard.
"Uniting in a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to address structural challenges," notes NPF's CEO, The Future, Nikolai Sidorov.
The Safmar-European, Education and Science and Regional Foundation pension group have been active in the consolidation of funds since April and should join the Safmar NPF before the end of this year.
In 2017, they will be joined by the NPF Trust.
"Funding together will have the effect of enhancing control over risk, operating processes and expenditure," noted in the Saffmar Pension Group.
The pause in the pooled funds sustained by KIT Finance Pension Administrator may be due to several reasons, experts indicate.
Until recently, NPF could not buy more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure bonds in which the group was heavily housed.
Since the amendments to the BC Regulation in March this year, there are no further restrictions on a number of issuers meeting regulatory requirements.
If necessary, the entire issue can be purchased by one major player," pointed out ACRA's director of the credit rating group Yuri Nogin.
Several NPF top 15 asset managers cite another possible reason for the pause as the division of spheres of influence and, as a result, staff appointments in a single fund that the group's owners had to agree upon.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment.
I didn't respond to an "I" call from the Gazfund NPF either.
While the consolidation of funds is a labour-intensive and inexpensive undertaking, this solution will be justified at a long distance.
As the CEO of the Pension Partner consulting company, Sergei Ocolesnov, notes, the Gazfund Pension Savings has fewer outflows, joining will stabilize the base of other group funds.
In doing so, the best experience of the NPF KIT Finance and Promagrofund in the construction of retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software, will be sought.
The requirements of the CD for NPF processes and personnel are constantly increasing, so it is not appropriate to duplicate infrastructure on four foundations under a single investment policy, according to the Managing Director for Corporate Ratings "Expert RA" Pavel Mitrophanov.
"The effect of reducing overlapping functions will definitely close down the possible costs of integration," Mr. Mitrophanov notes.
The cost of merging four funds by Sergei Okolesnov is estimated at 30-50 million rubles.
“The cost of maintaining four funds of this size is about 400 million rubles per year, with the consolidation of the budget in the medium term effectively cutting the budget by half”, Mr. Ocolesnov is sure.
The Russian rental of the nicest Disney movie, Pete and his dragon.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the comforting dragon, the soulful history, and country-style songs are enough to believe in old-fashioned magic again, thinks Elena CRAWTSUN.
A frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human baby and a tender nursemaid, and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his buddy Elliot, after a puppy from a book of fairy tales, plays with him in the chase and falls asleep in his arms.
Six years later, he was abandoned and in a loin bandage, no longer distinguishable from another clever forest raven, Mowgli.
In this form, Pete discovers a red-haired woman-egger Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while Gavin's brigade (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively boils the forest.
Now she's not only gonna have to believe in the dragon's existence, she's gonna have to help save it.
Pete is taking an accelerated course of "be human" surrounded by Idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, a moral code in the heart and smile more dazzling than any commercial.
No character looks or acts too bad for the audience to really start hating or afraid of him.
Even Gavin, who opened up the hunt for an atypical forester under his control, is far from an irreparable villain.
A huge fluffy dragon, too, came out not to be at all scary, with the good face of a bulldog, the plane's wingspan, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is funny, grinding, even grinding, and fortunately does not say, but he is always anxious to pet him, which is beneficially different from all known cinema dragons.
Elliot's visual image and his manner of holding on provides such a high degree of emotional engagement that, at the most stressful moments, they begin to cry desperately into three streams not only of small spectators, but also of adults.
Amazingly good and young Oaks Figley as Pete tearing between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford is virtuoso giving up a canonical grandfather who would love to have every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney film Dragon Pete, mediocre from the nose to the tip of the tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and game movies, and make it the most mental film this summer?
It's not like a miracle helped.
In his painting, Lowry from the original took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
The music numbers and most of the weird jokes are still out there.
This good tale reads features taken from "Bamby", "Alien" and many other sweet children's paintings.
Disney Studio continues to successfully expand the 21st-century high-quality remake gallery.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon isn't as amazing as the same Book of the Jungle, and it doesn't have the skillful villain that Kate Blanchett turned out to be as the stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naive film is no less successful in helping to believe in miracles and goodness in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magic castle, director Lowry, will get another one for the art adaptation of the story of Peter Pan.

RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged with a new offence
The lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of an extremist entity, stated that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had found shortcomings in their defendant ' s case.
We learned from the investigators just yesterday that the D.A.'s office made such a representation.
We were scheduled to take part in a court hearing on the issue of restricting access to the criminal file, but the meeting was not held, and the investigators informed us of the submission made by the Public Prosecutor's Office," RBC quotes lawyer Olga Dinza.
She said that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had pointed out to the investigators that the qualifications of the case and the materials collected were not consistent.
The investigators will now have to fill gaps in the evidence base and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (PC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Mrs. Dinza will specify.
As reported by IA, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation had removed from the indictment of the RBC journalist the phrases “determining the political situation towards instability” and “subversion of power through illegal means”.
The correspondent for the Kommersantboscosport, ALEXANDRE ZILBERT, spent his life as an Olympian in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian team, had lunch in the local dining room, and even passed the WADA test afterwards.
Life doesn't seem to be dying out here for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts are sometimes completed at midnight, after which athletes need an hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, resettlement and eviction from the village are carried out without interruption, as some athletes complete their performances and leave Brazil, while others only arrive here.
At 7:30 a.m., heads of all Olympic delegations are drawn into one of the temporary tents.
At these gatherings, we usually discuss some operational domestic matters,” Igor Kazikov, head of the Russian Olympic team sports delegation, says. “Even though the house in which ours was housed is considered to be exemplary—it was put into service as one of the first to be shown to all the inspectors, even in it, there are some shortcomings.
Hot water is a problem, I'm sorry, toilets.
We fought for purity for a long time.
At first, just no one came to clean.
Then the cliners started to come in, but they just pop some stuff on the floor, and that's it.
They have, you see, some innovative floors.
Like, you can't wash them in a human way.
We know these floors are ordinary laminates!
Anyway, we've got a change in the cleaning company, and now it's OK.
The Olympic village is such a South Butovo, a sleeping area fenced by mountains on one side, and with others an impressive moat, filled with water.
Well, there's still a two-metre iron fence all over the perimeter, along which there's automatics walking.
In total, up to 17,000 people can be accommodated in 3,604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-story buildings, there's a huge Russian flag-- this house is completely given to our team.
Looking at a small foyer at the entrance, one can immediately determine which problems may be most pressing for the domestic team.
There are two announcements on the front desk: a printed "Please don't throw paper in the toilet!" and from the hand of "I'll give you badges.
The counter itself drowns in the booklets.
Their fun color contrasts with the titles of the booklets: "Memorial on infectious diseases for travellers to Rio de Janeiro", "First aid on drowning, foreign body in respiratory tracts, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiovascular and lung resuscitation", "First aid on burns, thermal shock, fractures and bleeding".
The text inside is actually encouraging.
For example: “Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent treatment.
However, not all will have a favourable outcome.
Of course, there is a medical centre in the Russian team, which at any time is prepared to provide qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massages, to residents of the house.
Opposite the health centre is the very headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspirational poster, "No matter what, we'll win!"
And, of course, poems:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who are afraid believe in them.
Let less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And in order to raise the spirit even more, there is an announcement: "Dear brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all of Ruthy Cyril, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team is exercised by the protoyeres Andrey Vladimirovich Kareniev.
You can order some molebens and other trebs on the phone...
In fact, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious rites in the village for all denominations.
Well, Russians, in a privileged position, they have their own chapel.
Because of the elevator load from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs recommended for use in a fire.
And in the dark, he tripped over the bodies on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of the new cleaning company.
I suppose at any moment they're ready to throw themselves at the washing of the innovative genders, they've decided to have a quiet hour on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting to meet a longtime acquaintance, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, coach of our Batutists who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his pupil, European champion Jan Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
There's nothing to complain about, but Russia's well-deserved coach shares the impressions.
The sanuzel is one for four, but it's spacious.
The dresser, of course, is funny, made of fabric, untrustworthy, but something can be put down.
"No, you're playing, they're out of tea!" he's hand-blowing Svetlan Kuznetsov, a tennis player I met in the main dining room.
It is called main because it is an area of 2,700 square metres and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There's 60,000 meals a day, free of charge.
The menu variants are: Best From Brazil, Kitchens of the World, Asian Foods, and Pizza, pasta.
The last option, as I looked at it, is very popular with our volleyball players.
And let's just say I didn't find soup in any of the units of a giant restaurant.
I'm surprised by Kuznetsov.
It's a good thing I brought Chinese with me, custard.
And the kettle.
But just so you know, we've got worse food on the courts.
There's something you can choose here, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I personally picked a cod for a pair and meatballs in tomato sauce.
There is a tablet with its name in three languages, English, French and Portuguese, along with an indication of the food value of the product and the availability of allergens.
Well, I'll admit, it was edible.
I don't even understand why this line is worth all the time at the local McDonald's.
Satisfied, relaxed, you can say "hot" athletes on their way out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends, representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They're lured down by a t-shirt-winning Victorian.
Excitement, you might say!
To receive a gift, you have to answer at least eight questions out of ten properly.
There are questions in Russian - I was attacked by a WADA girl.
But I attacked the wrong guy.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic rush, naturally.
The situation was exacerbated by the second question: “If I have received notification of the doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?”
I stopped at option B, "No, I have one hour."
Lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I forgot that WADA's no longer amenable.
Anyway, we have to report immediately.
And in the seventh phase of the quiz, my position became quite critical.
Somehow I thought that if it's hard for me to keep a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and by the way, it's hard for me!), I can use bio-additionals to get "additional nutrients to increase my performance."
No, they won't!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in a way that is not categorically prohibited, but strongly discourages, in several sentences.
It's not fair playing this WADA!
- What's up, Russia?
There's nowhere to go - behind Efimov, Isinbayev, and all our bloodless crew.
That's why I've focused and won a miserable T-shirt out of my last strength.
Know ours, as they say!
In a winning mood, I wandered into the fitness center next door.
He's into counting the gyms.
He hit 250.
He noted with surprise that not a single Russian athlete had ever been found in this commotion of treadmills.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let the one who can't play be trained!
And here's a guy sitting in a health clinic nearby.
In line for the eye doctor.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
The health centre, however, has a condom distribution machine in place all over the village, where no one spits.
On it is an inspiring call: "Pray with a condom!"
The next thing to do is to twist the iron that resembles the door lock pen, and the condom, made from the natural latex of Amazonia, readily falls out of the machine.
I took one for my memory.
They've got 450,000 of them.
The Olympic village has an entire entertainment centre for celebrating and celebrating.
There's an educational plaque in front of him just in case, reminding him that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in different ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiard and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some strange devices similar to video trainers.
- I'm interested in a fellow Ukrainian team who is actively using a wild toy.
You could have just said that you didn't want to talk to a man in Russia's uniform, that's all.
By the way, there's a strange set of circumstances in your eyes that's been rumbling from the guys in the jade-blakit.
The most playing team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to get around the village by looking at each of its corners.
But if you walk rather than drive electric cars, you'll be able to open the Canadian team's house with a moose at the entrance and a tent with a recovery bathroom, and a ticket office, and a laundry and dry cleaning, and a hairdressing shop, and a flower shop, and a store with everyday goods, and a mail with unique stamps (only you won't be able to wait out from Chinese philatelists), and a bank, and a finds bureau, and a photo shop.
Late in the evening, you will sit by an olive tree with colored ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of athletes who have left this world.
And you'll be under the accompaniment of a machine randomly spraying fluid to kill insects, thinking about eternal.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which in this village doesn't stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world held its breath watching the Australians almost punish the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglasova won gold in the rapire at the XXXI Olympic Games, I got first.
Maybe I'm the only Moskwich who's ever seen this happen, except for those of course who were watching the Carioca competition that night.
That can only be understood by a real fan.
Imagine a deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors at the bottom - as always by 1:00 a.m. - wake up and start innocuously, but shout very loudly at each other.
And threatening to move furniture.
There's a crane running in the kitchen - no time to go to the market and buy a new one, just like the plumber asked.
The television schedule doesn't make sense, so it just kept the Match, First and in case Rossia channels in check, although it almost doesn't make sense.
"Russia" is the home of repeats, the whole sport is on record for some reason.
There's live TV shows.
Hope, of course, at Match, an entire evening a young man shouted in news issues first about the great semi-finals of Deriglas-Shanayev, then about the upcoming gold fight.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is U.S.-- Australia.
I can't say anything wrong with that decision, by the way.
The Australians were equal, the first half won at all.
They put the great Americans in their place.
As a result, they did lose, but, as it is now stated, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but there's a battle with Dee France, and there's no change on the screen.
In light panic, I'm starting to see the channels.
It feels like a second time in a row.
All right, let's go back to the cable.
There's no fencing on any of the Matches.
Oh, I feel like the fight's about to start.
I don't like the text and tweeting of some sports sites.
Sour surfing produces an unexpected but brilliant result.
The site “First” appears to be broadcasting all the competitions that take place at this point in time directly.
I click on fencing, I get a fight for gold.
Deriglasova is a great counterattacker, goes ahead on points - and clearly is starting to drag on time.
The Italian woman is playing out almost all the time.
Ours is one point ahead, just over two seconds to the end.
Di Francesca throws herself at Deriglazova, she retreats, time runs out, Italian woman injects.
Victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic Messenger on the phone reports a fourth gold medal.
So I'm the first one to see it with my own eyes.
Mad, faithful, involved.
The spiritual administration of Muslims (MUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the Plenum of the DUM ordered its imams to perform Friday sermons only in Tatar to force young Tatars "to learn their native language".
The Directorate states that this “in no case infringes” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani laments that the Tatar language does not understand up to 60 per cent of the parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves.
Imams fear their Tartar sermons "will not reach the entire audience."
Yesterday, the Tatarstan plenary decided unanimously to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic in Tatar only.
As the Mutharstana Mufti Kamil Samigullin stated, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "learn their mother tongue."
"For those who say it's "heavy" in every big mosque, we intend to organize Tatar language lessons for absolutely free," said Mr. Samigullin.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today, in all mosques, the sermons "should already be in Tatar."
He recalled that Tatarstan's DUM publishes the magazine Shura with model sermons in Tatar.
Imam, who doesn't speak very well in Tatar, "can prepare himself for them."
The DUM Tatarstana unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to the Mufti, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in Tatar in the districts.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques previously used predominantly Russian.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practised in Burnayev Mosque, Zakabanna and Eniler.
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed, the leadership is working to ensure that all students are fluent in both the national languages of the Republic, regardless of their nationality.
"There can be no harm to non-Muslim Muslims," Mr. Muhametshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself was "not compulsory, the main part of the prayer."
At the same time, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons in Russian will continue in the mosques.
At the same time, Rafiq Muhametshin said "I" that there was no serious threat that the Tatar language would be pushed out of the mosques.
Apart from Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in sermons in the Republic.
The decision of the DMW was actively supported in the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (WTC).
The head of WCT executive Rinat Zakirov said, "I'm an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language were out of this sphere.
He noted that preaching was only in the Tatar language "the wish of the imams themselves", but in the WCT executive board "considers it right."
The "I" imams interviewed, who preached in Russian, are willing to comply with the decision of the DUM, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulty understanding the clergy.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
A lot of people don't understand the language.
They'll be tight, of course.
"It will have to be rebuilt," says the Imam of the Burnayev Mosque of Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, Russian-language sermons are closer to even many Tatars, as "Russian both in schools and in kindergartens, on radio, everywhere in the first place."
However, he believed that the mosque would be able to continue with lessons and lectures in Russian, which were held on other days.
In Allah do we rely.
Allah will show you a way out of this," he concluded.
But about 60% of us don't know Tatar.
These are Uzbeks and Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been in Russian for four years," the imam says.
He believes that in Tatar the sermons will "go to a narrower circle and not reach the entire audience."
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
It's just that the outcome of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
"It'll be easier for me, for example, because the Tatar language is my own," concluded Gabdullah Galiullin.
The former director of the FSI has been brought to trial
The Prosecutor ' s Office of Moscow has confirmed the indictment of the criminal case of misappropriation of the budget allocated to the Russian Federal Penal Correction Service, which was investigated by the SSO.
The former head of the prison department, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, who caused more than 2.7 billion rubles to the FSI, will be tried.
The Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office sent a criminal case against the former Director of the Russian Federal Penal Correction Service, Alexander Reimer, his former deputy, Nikolai Kryvolapov, to Zamoskoretsky Raydetz Court, as well as the Director of the Federal Criminal Correction Service's Information Technology and Communications Centre (FGPC) Victor Vrovov.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are charged by the SSO of Moscow under article 285, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code (abuse of official authority, with serious consequences), article 159, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code (fraud committed using their official position, in an organized group, in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Kryvolapov is charged under article 222, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, in 2010-2012, these individuals fraudulently stole from the State treasury the budget allocated to the FINS to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal budgetary money, the group developed a scheme whereby the FGP-controlled CITES company with which the relevant public contracts were concluded produced technical means of control and supervision, including “electronic bracelets”, and implemented at several times overpriced prices.
Although FGPC CITES did not have production equipment, buildings and facilities to accommodate the production capacity to create a complete cycle of production of “electronic bracelets”, five state contracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles were concluded between it and the Russian Federal Penal Correction Service.
The scheme resulted in more than 2 billion rubles in the accounts of the Samar branch of FGP, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
As a result, more than 140 million roubles of cash cash were personally received by Mr. Reimer in his office from an accomplice in the criminal proceedings against whom separate proceedings have been instituted.
Nikolai Kryvolapov, who was involved in the schemes, was found to have an unknown origin of the cartridge to a reward pistol, which allowed him to be charged with additional offences.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the Federal Penal Correction Service filed a claim for material damages in the amount of 2.7 billion roubles against the accused.
Football player Hakan Shukur is suspected of involvement in the putsch.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former footballer and then Member of Parliament Hakan Shukür and searched two of his family's homes.
The Turkish football star of the 1990s and early 2000s, the attacker Hakan Shukur, is wanted by the country's authorities in connection with an attempted coup d'état last month.
Forward, who graduated from his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an “armed terrorist group”.
This is the Khismet movement, a society associated with the famous Turkish religious figure and opposition Fethullah Gulen.
It is its President Erdoğan who considers the attempted military coup of 15 July to be the organizer.
Fethullah Gulen resides in the United States, the Turkish authorities request his extradition.
Local media reports that a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukur was issued today, and police have already searched two houses belonging to the family of a former footballer.
According to the investigation, Fethullah Gülen's organization included his father in addition to Hakan Shukür himself.
However, neither the former footballer nor his loved ones were there.
He and his family now reside in the United States.
As a footballer, Hakan Shukur defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and competed for the country.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian Torino, Inter and Palermo, as well as English Blackburn.
He hasn't spent more than one season in any of them, though.
Hakan Shukur still remains Turkey's most successful attacking team: in his asset 112 matches for the national team and 51 scored.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his post due to an ongoing corruption investigation around Erdogan's party and his immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists were arrested on 25 July in Turkey.
They are accused of contributing to the military coup and of being associated with opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen living in the United States.
Given the seriousness of the charges, media officers may wait for long prison terms ranging from 10 years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovski wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinemas that cost tickets two to three times as much as foreign films," he said.
Mr. Konchalovski notes that Russian films find it difficult to compete for an audience with large Hollywood ribbons.
We have more than 100 paintings a year, with an average of 20-25 ribbons reaching the screens.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with the Transformers and the Iron Man, in the promotion of which huge budgets are pumped," said the film director.
The All-Russian Youth Education Forum “Tavrida” was launched in Crimea on 1 July.
Participants include creative teachers and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian backgrounds from all over Russia and a number of neighbouring and distant countries.

I-News - The new contractor promises to surrender Zenit Arena by December 26.
The new general contractor of the stadium under construction in St. Petersburg, which is to receive the Confederate Cup-2017 matches and the 2018 World Cup, Metrostray promises to surrender the arena by 26 December, reports RIA Newsty with reference to the head of the Federation Council's interim commission for preparing for the 2018 Vadim Tulipanov World Cup.
"Today, the Russian Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko, and I visited the building, and the CEO of Metrostria, Vadim Alexandrov, were with us.
He said he'd rent out the stadium by December 26.
It's a serious peterburg company, it never breaks the deadline.
Vitaly Mutko and I were satisfied with what we saw and heard," quotes the interlocutor's agency.
Vitaly Mutko had previously arrived in St. Petersburg to inspect the venue of the upcoming large-scale competitions.
Mr. Tulipanov also noted that his commission of Sovfed would continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and would regularly visit the construction.
As will be recalled, it was reported yesterday that Metrostroy would complete the construction of Zenit Arena, the contract would cost approximately 5.4 billion rubles. The same company won a bid to upgrade the area around the stadium, the contract price was 2.4 billion rubles. Contracts with Transtroy, Transtroy Engineering Corporation and Transtroy Engineering Corporation were terminated.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the stadium.
For more information on the selection of the new contractor, read "I" "Metrostroroy" into the field."
The lawyer of former Lieutenant Governor Nikolai Sandakova Constantine Akulić is detained in Miassa, Chelyabinsk Oblast.
According to I-South Ural, another lawyer for the accused, Sergei Kolosovsky, Constantine Akulić, was summoned to the SCR Miass investigation unit today to be charged in a one-year-old assault case.
Constantine Akulić then went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to assist one of his participants.
"It was originally brought against unidentified persons, now that he began defending Nikolai Sandakovsky, it turned out to be Akulić," says Sergei Kolosovsky.
Constantine Akulić became a lawyer for an ex-substitute governor in early August.
However, half an hour before the lawyer was called to the SCR, the defence side was informed that the deadline for reading the files of the fraud case against Nikolai Sandakov was due to expire on Monday.
Let us recall that two criminal proceedings have been instituted against Nikolai Sandakov.
In the first (fraud case), he is accused of promising for 1.5 million rubles to facilitate the appointment of the mayor of Magnitogorsk as head of administration of Ozersk Eugenia Tarasov.
The second criminal case concerns bribes allegedly received by Nikolai Sandakov from the director of the Python PUP, Igor Kalugin, in the form of illegal donations of property services of at least 1.3 million roubles.
For more information on Mr. Sandakov's case, read in "I" "Former Lieutenant Governor demands that his business be combined."
The Russian copper company (RMC) is ready to assume social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMC has undertaken to modernize one of the country's oldest and most environmentally polluting enterprises, the Carabash copper smelter.
The Carabash Copper Smelter was founded by an English joint stock company led by Leslie Urquart in 1910.
In Soviet times, this was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually ensured the viability of an entire city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was halted, causing serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, a decision was taken to reopen the Karabash copper smelter.
It was also necessary to address one of the main problems of the Karabash plant, the environmental one.
By the early 2000s Karabash was already notorious as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation for Carabashmedi began to change in 2004 after the company was taken over by the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to upgrade production, gradually reducing the environmental burden.
This was also recently noted by the governor of Chelyabinsk region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Carabashmedi in the early days of July.
South Ural's head described the tremendous changes that had taken place with the enterprise since Carabashmede moved to the RMC group.
The main modernization activity of Carabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sulphur acid shop, which captures up to 99.9 per cent of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian copper company All-Wolod Levine, the investment in this project amounted to about 7 billion roubles.
The next stage of the upgrading of the Carabashmedi-Carabashmedi-Carabashmedi-Carabashmedi-Carabashmedi-Carabashmedi-Carabashmedi-Carabashmed
The replacement of the three converters, the pulverizers, the gas-traffic tract is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, a new 1 billion ruble industrial waste-water treatment plant is planned for the end of 2016.
In turn, the amount of taxes allocated to the city of Karabash will also increase.
Over the entire period of the project of the Tominsk Goka, from the start of construction to the operationalization of Release 2, the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
Once the GHQ has been put into operation, the collection of taxes at all levels can amount to 80.9 billion roubles.
During the year of production in the Varnen region, 346.3 million roubles were allocated to various levels of budgets.
And that's in the first year.
"The longer the enterprise succeeds, the amount of the deductions may be higher," added Valery Ulanovsky.
In the RMC, it was clarified that in 2015 tax contributions from the Miheyevian GPA were close to 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of CMI enterprises in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax deductions.
RMI enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and recreational facilities and the development of areas.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian copper company in Karabash was the major renovation, and in fact the almost complete restructuring of the N9 kindergarten by 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of emergency.
There will also be a landscape park with artificial ponds, underground and above-ground parking facilities with 600 machines, cafes and sports stores on the premises of the RMC Arena.
The Arena RMC will allow for spectacular professional sporting events at the international level.
But the main objective of this project is to make physical education and sports in comfortable conditions accessible to the people of Chelyabinsk, especially children.

The Sandholm Refugee Centre in Denmark suspected that young people living there were involved in prostitution.
This is reported by The Local on Thursday, August 11.
According to him, some youths told the staff that “someone in Copenhagen organises prostitution”.
According to the publication, the doubts of the shelter workers arose after the Swedish newspaper Sydsvenkan told about similar stories in Malma.
In 2015, a crisis broke out in the European Union due to the influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East.
Denmark has housed more than 20,000 of them in its territory.
A fisherman caught a rare blue lobster off the coast of Cape Cod Peninsula, U.S.A.
The man found crustaceans among others caught in his underwater trap, reports ABC News.
The American plans to transfer it to the local oceanarium.
Lobster weighs about a kilo.
It is noted that Wayne Nickerson has been fishing lobsters for the past 35 years.
According to his wife, for the first time in his career a man was caught in a blue lobster in 1990.
According to ABC News, crustaceans acquire blue or blue colour as a result of genetic changes.
In April 2016, it was reported that fishermen had caught off the coast of Japan a copy of the rarest species of deep-sea shark Megachasma pelagios (bigshark).
A five-metre animal weighs about a ton.
The Black Sea Navy military conducted an exercise on submarine-diversion defence in the Black Sea.
This was reported by RIA Newsto, a spokesman for the Department of Defense Press Service for the Navy, Igor Dugalo.
The training was conducted as part of the first phase of a special support exercise for the Navy.
"Militaries of submarine-diversity units have worked on the anti-submarine-diversion defence of the fleet's naval base on the coast and adjacent sea area of the Black Sea," Dugalo clarified.
Some 400 military personnel, more than 10 military equipment, including Mi-8 and Ka-27 helicopters, Groconoke anti-diversification boats and Raptor patrol speedboats, participated in the exercise.
During manoeuvres, the forces of the battleships using hydroacoustic means discovered conditional sabotage groups and repulsed the naval attack by the submarine sabotagers on the FF force base.
A landing party landed from the Ka-27 helicopter and blocked and destroyed the defectors of the contingent enemy.
The Black Sea fleet trawlers then entered the sea to search for mines.
Dugalo stated that "the Black Sea Navy's data are conducted in accordance with the design and conduct of the upcoming Command Staff Exercise "Caucas-2016" and the Navy Training Plan".
From July 18 to 30, Ukraine and the United States conducted joint military exercises of Sea Breeze 2016 fleets on the Black Sea.
A total of about 4,000 people from 16 countries participated in the manoeuvres.
The maritime component involved more than 25 ships, boats and support ships from the United States, Turkey, Romania and Ukraine.
The court in Podskovje arrested his father for the murder of his adoptive daughter: Investigation and trial: Power structures: Lenta.ru
The Lake City Court of Moscow Region authorized the arrest of Roman Chernikov, who confessed to the murder of his six-year-old adoptive daughter.
On Thursday, August 11, according to the Moscow City News Agency, a spokesman for the Nina Gilkin court told the story.
"The Court granted the request of the investigating authorities for the selection of a preventive measure against Chernikov in the form of two months' detention," she said.
Chernikov will be under arrest until October 9.
On 11 August, the Office of the SCR for the Moscow Region reported that a six-year-old girl's foster parents and grandmother had confessed to her murder.
In particular, Roman Chernikov reported that he committed the murder of a child on one of the days of April 2016 out of personal dislike while at home in a state of drunkenness.
Then, in order to conceal the child's body, he burned him and spread the remains with his wife in a large area.
On the evening of 9 August, during interrogation with the investigator, a foster parent reported that a six-year-old child had drowned in a bath in April 2016.
They were able to hide the disappearance of the girl for a long time, but in August, when they learned that they were about to be visited by the guardianship authorities, they decided to tell everyone that the child was missing.
The parents stated that, on 6 August, their foster daughter had left the family home and disappeared.
Pope Francis shared a meal in the Vatican with refugees from Syria.
This was reported on Thursday, August 11, by the Chief of the Press of the Holy See, Greg Burke, transmitting CTV News.
Migrants came at the invitation of the Pontiff from the Greek island of Lesbos.
Lunch took place at the Vatican House of St. Martha, where Francis' personal apartments are located.

Then, on his way back to the Vatican, he boarded his plane with 12 migrants, including six children.
A second group of Syrians arrived in June.
The Holy Throne has taken care of them.
"Dad brought toys and gifts to the children, they gave him back their drawings and children, and adults were able to talk to the pontiff today about the first days of their life in Italy," Burke said.
During his April visit, the Pope called the migration crisis that erupted in Europe in 2015 "the greatest disaster since World War II."
Greece is one of the countries through which Europe receives the largest number of migrants.
According to the Greek authorities, a total of 800,000 people moved from Turkey to the Greek-owned islands in the Aegean Sea in 2015.
However, Lesbos became the main crossing point for refugees en route to the EU.

The pensioner turned the ladder into a "budget beach tower."
Network users laughed at photographs on which an elderly man set up a ladder on the beach and turned it into a jumpway to water.
The picture was published on several entertainment portals as well as in the Moi Tagangrog group on the Vkontakte social network, which led many to believe that the photograph was taken on the shore of the Azov Sea.
In the comments, "innovation" was called a "budget tower" and a "mobile tram."
Many praised the man for his ingenuity and "sneaking," and some noted that the man was seriously at risk of being injured when jumping from his tower because he had placed it at insufficient depth.
However, one of the commensers on the Pikabu portal noted that it was not possible to judge the depth of the sea from the image.
"First, we don't know what depth there is, the beach can be an embankment with a sharp descent of a meter just behind the stairs, and second, even if there's a meter of depth, you can jump from a few meters if you're right," the user wrote under the name C0JIbAMDJZ.
Meanwhile, the Italian edition of Roma Today writes that a man with a stairway was seen on a beach under Rome.

The French city of Canna prohibited local beaches from visiting the burkini, a special bathing suit for women, which completely covers the body from head to ankle.
This is reported by ABC News on Friday, August 12.
The Mayor of Cann David Lisnard explained that such clothing "does not conform to the rules of decency, the principles of secularism, and the standards of hygiene and safety".
He also said that clothes that emphasize religious affiliation could cause disorder.
A fine of 38 euros (about $42) has been imposed for the wearing of burkini.
It is noted that the ban was imposed against the background of the attacks of 15 July in Nice and 26 July in the church of St. Etienne du Ruvre in the north of the country.
Since its introduction, several Muslim women had applied to the courts, claiming that the restrictions violated the right to freedom of religion.
The Goodwillen City Court (Amur Oblast) sentenced the former head of the city of Alexander Migulu to nine years of common regime colony.
This is reported on the court's website on Friday, 12 August.
Migulu was found guilty of offences under articles 286 (Excessive exercise of authority), 285.1 (Unearmarked expenditure of budgetary resources) and 285 (Abuse of official powers) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation found that an official in December 2008 had provided a familiar land in the village of Muhinka with a violation of the land law procedure.
In 2006, he illegally ordered the acquisition of the city's road bridge over the Chigiri River, at an overpriced price without competitive procedures and a municipal contract, as explained by Interfax.
In addition, between 2007 and 2010, Miguel, in the interest of a commercial organization under its control, changed the timing of payments under a contract for the sale of a lease on a land that had been granted for the construction of a dwelling and also exempted the company from rent.
As a result, more than 5 million rubles were underfunded by the province’s budget, and the city’s treasury was about 21 million rubles.
On 4 August, it was reported that a former city chief in custody on suspicion of corruption and a candidate for a deputy's mandate had not provided the Subscriptions for the State Duma election within a period of time and had been withdrawn from the election race.
Miguela was detained in May 2015 in Lipetsk Oblast and placed in SIZO.
Prior to that, he had been on international search since 2011.
Alexander Migula served as Mayor of the Blagovesensk from November 2004 to April 2010.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Thailand has accused local sabotagers of bombing.
The Thai resort bombings are “local sabotage acts” and have nothing to do with the activities of international terrorists.
This was reported by Reuters police in Thailand.
According to the security forces, they have not yet been able to determine whether any of the explosions are linked.
According to the main version, their organizers tried to disrupt the tourist season.
There may be Muslim separatists from the south behind the explosions.
The law enforcement authorities have already detained several people.
To date, four dead and several dozen wounded have been reported.
The premier of the country, Pravat Chan-Ocha, ordered additional security measures to prevent further explosions and to exclude possible victims.

The owners of Messengers and postal services are required to identify users and remove prohibited information - this is the summary of a bill developed by the Media and Communication Union (MCS) that unites the largest Russian telecommunications operators (there are Vedomosti).
The staff of the three member companies confirmed that such a project was under discussion.
In early autumn, it should be presented to a working group led by First Vice-Prime Igor Shuvalov, an interviewee of Vedomosti at the ISS.
These are amendments to the communications and media laws.
They provide that any “channel for the dissemination of information on the Internet that allows for the exchange of electronic messages” is obliged to identify users on the basis of the information contained in the databases of the telecommunications operators by pre-contracting them.
As well as “immediately block messages or publications that contain information that is disseminated in violation of the requirements of Russian law”.
Otherwise, operators are entitled to restrict access to the service by decision of Roscomnadzor.

The mysterious finding was named Niku, which in Chinese means "rebel," "unsubdued."
WSJ: The US is considering imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation due to hacking Democrat servers.
U.S. officials are considering imposing new sanctions against Russia in response to hacking Democratic Party servers, writing The Wall Street Journal citing sources.
In order to impose sanctions, it is reported that US President Barack Obama’s administration will have to formally charge Russia’s servers or Russian-backed hackers.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia's involvement in cyberattacks.
WSJ notes that the U.S. usually prefers not to name those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exception is the hacking of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database in 2014, for which the DPRK was officially held responsible.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree to facilitate the imposition of sanctions against those who carry out or contribute to cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be lengthy, writing a publication.
Even if officials have come to the conclusion that the hackers acted with Russia's support, they will have to weigh the possible consequences before taking a decision on disclosure.
They will have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
It has previously been reported that the Barack Obama administration allows sanctions to be imposed on a state whose hackers hacked into the Democratic Party's National Committee servers.
The WikiLeaks website published an e-mail of the National Committee of Democrats.
The media reported that hackers working with Russian authorities could be involved in the hacking.
In the Kremlin, such reports were described as absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles.
The reason was the breaking of competition in the mobile app market.
The anti-monopoly proceedings were initiated by the Yandex.
The Russian company argued that Google provided smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components on terms that prohibited applications from being pre-established by other developers, in particular the Yandex.
FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company abused the dominant market position and imposed on mobile device manufacturers the installation of other applications along with Google Play's store.
As a result of the audit, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, and reported to the deputy head of FAS Alexei Docenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that all companies, including transnational corporations, must comply with the competition protection law.
In turn, Google intends to first examine the decision and only then determine with further action whether to execute it or challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service found the company to be in breach of the competition law as early as September last year and ordered the contracts to be amended until December 18.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the agency have been conducting judicial proceedings.
The FAS noted that despite the fine, Google was discussing the possibility of a settlement agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
That was the opinion of Ehu Moscow's leading analyst, Mobile Research Group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would have no impact on either the users or the corporation's competitiveness.
The Voljanin rented the apartment and then stole it for 84,000 rubles.
A 30-year-old burglar sold stolen household equipment.
As told to the correspondent of the “MK in Volgograd” in the press service of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs regional office, a resident of a satellite town reported the robbery to the Volzhsky police station the previous day.
The man told the law keepers that the unsub had rented an apartment from him.
When the owner visited his home, he found it completely empty: no washing machine, no television, no refrigerator, and no tenant.
The total amount of damage was 84,000 roubles.
The security forces soon followed the thief.
They turned out to be a 30-year-old unemployed Voljanin.
The man was detained and confessed, reporting that the stolen property had already been sold.
Now he'll have to answer for the theft in all its severity - criminal proceedings have been instituted against the detainee.

The average annual inflation measured by the CPI over the past 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared with the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 per cent, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 per cent.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2 per cent, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2 per cent.

The effect of "Anime" Snapchat is criticized as a cartoon of Asians.
Snapchat states that this filter is inspired by anime, but some commentators say it is racially tactless.
Using the "Linza" Snapchat tool, it allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to frame Roy Liechtenstein's painting.
Linzes are gross, crookeding features of instruments that create more than 30 million adjusted selfies per day.
Any mistakes quickly become common knowledge.
Snapchat lenses were criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of the face or encouraging bleached faces as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them slashy eyes, curved teeth and puddles, some critics considered it a racist cartoon of Asians, the "yellows."
And they wondered whether these recurring contradictions pointed to the more serious diversity problem of the company.
On Wednesday, messages spread and subsequent resentment in the reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat stated that they had removed this function.
The company commented that the lens was conceived as a respect for anime characters rather than as a cartoon for Asians.
But experts who know about racism in the first place, the lens resembled offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an e-mail from Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about photographs was actively shared, said the lens was "insulting and at least embarrassing."
She added that "it was hard to argue with comparing side by side a very rough caricature on Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow-faced, but highly demeaningly yellow-faced.
Snapchat is not the only company to pass through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems involved in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and the deways we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- which is more racially diverse than their older generation -- can mean they're more likely to be understanding.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image offensive to the user, then, said in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Joo, "it's a lot harder to go unnoticed than it used to be."
On Thursday, Zhou, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her account at Snapchat and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believed that racial contradictions were the reason for the lack of diversity in recruitment in Snepchat.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white management consisting of only men and ended her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu wrote, who is an American of Chinese origin herself, "They did not have enough non-white people in the state to make such decisions, or they have non-white people working, but they do not hold positions in which you can speak out safely and openly."
Other commentators share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but according to a trusted person, the company recently hired a recruiter to concentrate on underrepresented segments of the population and to actively try to attract domestic resources.
For her part, Zhou said that she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to tell them it won't work."
Military authorities distorted ISIS intelligence, Congressional Commission reports
Officials from the Central Command of the U.S. Armed Forces changed intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than was warranted by events on the ground, reported by the congressional commission in a report released on Thursday.
The interim report of the task force set up by the Republican Presidents of the House of Representatives Committee on Military Affairs, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread discontent" among Central Command Intelligence Service analysts who claimed that the leaders had manipulated their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centk, is the main military authority in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence documents confirmed by the Centcom High Command generally provided a more optimistic picture of U.S. anti-terrorist actions than is confirmed by actual evidence from the scene, and were stable more optimistic than analysis provided by other intelligence agencies," said the news release dedicated to the report.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable: when the top leadership is presented with an untrustworthy analysis, our military suffers," said House of Representatives member Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Management problems in the Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report deals in detail with the shortcomings that have constantly arisen in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing American actions aimed at training Iraqi armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration have ordered reports to be falsified, he claims that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership forces them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimonies from the Central Command in Congress were far more optimistic than real events," the report reported.
For example, Centcoma’s official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it's known for certain," said House member Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest command of the U.S. Central Command Intelligence Service forged command intelligence documents to minimize the threat posed by ISIL in Iraq.
Republicans formed a task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report published on Thursday will be followed by more up-to-date data.
An additional investigation of the Centcom intelligence is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic Party representatives on the Intelligence Committee of the United States House of Representatives published their own data on Thursday, which are consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, Centk created an overly restricted procedure for conducting intelligence assessments concerning ISIL and Iraqi security forces," claims House member Adam B. Schiff, the chief Democratic Party representative on the committee in a statement.
This procedure, according to Schiff, “stamped the production of intelligence documents”, damaged the morale of analysts and “not sufficiently reflects divergent views”.
But Schiff and Democrats claim that they found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to "an intended or political interpretation."
Preliminary results of the Congress investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast portal.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon Chief Inspector, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the Chief Inspector's investigation continues.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree when interpreting complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence welcome healthy dialogue on these vital topics of national security."
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American bombing in Iraq and Syria (as is now claimed by more representatives of the Ministry of Defence) is reaching its target.
But last year’s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide truthful assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis points.
Criticism of Islamic intelligence repeats the controversy that took place more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article alleging that President George Walker Bush's administration had advocated for a small number of troops in Iraq because of protests by many analysts and had not thought what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, Hooker's team came to the conclusion that despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes on Islamic-state-owned refineries did not result in a significant deterioration in the terrorist group's financial situation because it built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside the Central Command, as the Times reported in September.
The then Centcom Commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many MPs considered an overly optimistic assessment of war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by Central Command Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. wins four consecutive women's field hockey, thus approaching a decisive battle with Britain
Having once scored three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam opened the account on Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team when the Americans defeated India's 3-0 team.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, who is 27 years old, claims she wouldn't be sure if she would ever do something like that.
"I can't put my mind to it," she said.
I'm not really the kind of person who tracks my goals.
Here's what she knows: the 4-0 American score in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for the first place in their band with Britain, which remains undefeated after Japan's 2-0 loss on Thursday.
British and U.S. teams will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams claim the quarterfinals, and the result of the game will determine who will rank first in their group of six teams and who will rank second.
The winner will avoid meeting with a strong team of rivals from Holland, leaders of another group, a little while later when quarterfinal games begin.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made noise with their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took a hockey club on grass when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played this sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at age 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she did not qualify for the finals.
Then came 2012 when things didn't work out with her and her teammates.
The following year Coig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything started to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the productivity we have now.
We've completely changed our minds.
On Thursday night, Bam opened an account in the first half of the game with a cast with an uncomfortable hand on a short distance.
India approached the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative.
She made a long passage with a ball down the left side of the field, then in a spiral she entered the middle and sent the ball to the gate abruptly, giving the Americans an advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added a final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" victory was the first in a tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs to miss one goal each in the first three wins.
She's on fire.
So was Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," Parnham said, but how good it depends on Saturday's game result.
In the midst of the frenzy of the Olympic Games - "zen" jumps on the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how long it takes, it's the Olympics.
The events at Rio seem to be constant and inevitable, a ferocious combination of competition and ambition.
It's like the Olympic fire itself and it's that burning torch that goes from archer to swimmer, to gymnast, to triathlonist.
You can't turn on TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbors talking in turn in the cafe and not hear about Simon Bales, Katie Ledeki, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
There's also Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who competed for the first time in the Olympic Games, a handsome man with dimples on his cheeks, could well be among those celebrities shown in prime time promoted by sponsors and life-settling commercials if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest in California fights for gold in Olympic battling competitions.
The Olympic fire does not cover all events in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shadows, are those sports that are not universally accepted: air gun shooting, bow shooting, badminton, Taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, a long reign for him.
But if I am allowed to speak timidly in defense of my personal addiction, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of jumping on a trampoline.
Although batoon jumps have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people I interviewed were unaware that they were even associated with Olympic sports.
This could be regional ignorance.
Even though the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in trampoline jumps, and their athletes did not go to the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians generally share male awards, and Chinese and Canadians share female awards.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumps have an outsider charm, particularly because for an unenlightened ear, it is more associated with circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just a grounded enthusiast.
They do have comical potential — a cartoon glimpse of endless leaps — but also the grace of gymnastics and jumping into water, the two kinds of sport they basically combine in themselves.
The word "butut" comes from the Spanish word "el trumpolín", meaning "trumplin for jumping into water."
The winners jump on a giant trampoline, taking off almost 30 feet in the air, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends, and salto) before finally landing on their feet.
They are evaluated by performance, complexity, and "flight time", according to the official Olympic Games program.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
The medal contenders must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to finish, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth in the field.
They seek not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in front of television cameras, to another irritating frontier: a world record or an Olympic record.
This persistent aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatical — and it is enough to make even the audience cry.
But it's, in my opinion, a little exhausting watching the Games.
He gives you a break to jump on a trampoline.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she leaps, seems weightless like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then without effort up again.
And, of course, they don't go without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program, there's no crazy zeal for finish, no long jumps, just a wonderful, elegant disappearance of time and gravity.
This is the closest zen Olympic sport to zen.
Women's qualifying competitions and then finals will be held on Friday afternoon, airing at 1 p.m. Eastern European time; men's on Saturday, also at 1 p.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of the day program starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected that can easily be seen in a common landfill.
And if consciousness growth can only be achieved by subjecting male athletes to covetous views and objectivity — as Wall Street Journal recently suggested by men hymnasts from the United States — Dooley is only waiting for his new admired crowd of fans.
"The Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia faced fierce opposition from the Government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally wounded in clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of division?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a firm ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shocked the country, extending to an increasing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s reaction was brutal.
Eyewitnesses claimed that dozens of unarmed demonstrators had been shot by police officers.
Video recordings from the protest sites, allegedly taken at the end of the past or early this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they were placed with their hands against the wall.
The highest United Nations official for human rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country from decaying, and it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the head of the Horn of Africa project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
The American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably — there is even a new suburban train in Addis Ababa, the capital.
And her streets tend to be quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy — human rights organizations constantly mention government repression — opposition in the territory of the State has been suppressed by the fact that dissidents were effectively silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But that could change.
"If people are constantly repressed and left with no options other than protest, there will be a rebellion," said Seium Teshome, a lecturer at the university in central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, ranging from land use to the seizure of power by the government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies completely displaced the opposition and now control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the Eritrean border are increasing; the struggle for this uncertain, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit unrest and re-arm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings that have been boiling deep for several years are inflamed now.
The first one seems to be completely harmless: smartphones.
In the last couple of years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and Internet services have improved.
Even when the government shuts down Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was how they organized the protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But that's also changing.
"We will act together under one command," said Mulata Gemet, leader of Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics, are unjustly dominant in Ethiopia.
The third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts claim that he was particularly skilled in recognising the first signs of discontent and using scouts to obtain data and defuse opponents.
"The current regime lacks common sense," Abdi said, an analyst in conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalin, appeared out of nowhere and took Meles' place.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tygray region in northern Ethiopia, Heilemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he doesn't have the confidence of the security services controlled by Tygray.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said appeared to have been elections that the government screwed up and then forged the results.
In the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, albeit in smaller numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest has passed relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for the far-sighted development of infrastructure, such as the new intercity train and the significant progress made in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the increase in internal dissatisfaction with the Ethiopian Government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters in Gondara, a city in Amhara, attacked businesses owned by Tygray, and anti-Tygray hatred on social media becomes comprehensive.
Analysts claim that protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already fragile region.
"And it's going to be hard to get through this tight rope," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIL was founded by Obama, "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump attempted to lull the last conflict that engulfed his campaign headquarters on Friday, claiming that he was joking when several times this week stated that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to deal with the American people in a meaningful manner.
It also placed his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements he probably did not mean.
After making this suggestion at the convention on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton had founded ISIL.
But in a post on Twitter early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just echidnic.
This post was the direct opposite of a statement made just a day earlier when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When radio conservator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the speech, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIL, Republican Party presidential candidate did not take the opportunity.
The last scandal broke out when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy against a background of declining ratings.
Trump and Clinton made competing speeches about the economy in Michigan this week.
Trump tried to get back to the subject on Friday.
Again using Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to an increase in taxes, and stated that he found her speech boring.
Trump used sarcasm earlier as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he came across a general criticism, practically suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mail, he later explained his remarks, saying, "Of course, I'm kidding."
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and to take back what he says when necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing some messages that find a response among his fans, watching them act, and then "explaining" them in one way or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his remarks and knows they're vague enough to interpret them differently.
Instead of softening the remarks for a broad electorate, Trump has taken an even more sarcastic tone in recent days, while his ranking continues to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist ranking published on Friday showed that Trump is inferior to Clinton with a large margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and goes up to her in Florida.
Although Trump typically tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has been the focus of much attention in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his faithful allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, however provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most famous alternates, made a serious effort to protect the candidate in an interview given by CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is an acceptable political comment," Giuliani said, when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic state.
It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIL was an almost unknown little organization, he called it a non-threatening, totally unfair, and that's why it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most average Republicans assure that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIL to develop as it failed to address the situation in the Middle East harshly.
Before the Pennsylvania rally on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for embittering every word he said and prejudiced against him.
He bullied "poor poor" television experts who tried to solve it, and said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's acquittals as an unnecessary confirmation that he was unfit for presidentship.
Once displaced coffeehouse returns to Greenpoint
Verb's coffee shop was full of cash only in Williamsburg, which had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of her room with a window on Bedford Avenue.
Soup Sherie's store, which took Verb's place in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soap.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in an up-to-date city.
Artist Molly Krabaple tweeted, "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe the CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap store."
But even though New York is constantly changing, it is, in turn, being updated.
Verb's restored coffee shop opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but there are some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Plus, the coffee's still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager of the new location.
He started working at Verba in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him at a new location, he said he would love to do it.
Rodriguez, aged 36, left much behind.
Verb works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even has old Verba chandeliers in it.
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu features bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches, and there is a topping of capers or fried onions available.
There's brown rice.
The coffee shop doesn't serve beer anymore, but now they're making freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said that he had drawn attention to the constant flow of old regular customers.
"Many ex-clients were also priced from Williamsberg," he said.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Oliveira, who was 34 years old, used to live in Williamsberg and frequented Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she went there anyway.
After Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized it was the coffee and the atmosphere that embedded me in Verba," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, although that day she ordered bathed tea, another novelty, instead of ordinary ice coffee.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been loyal to Verb since 2003.
He stopped by before work and ordered the same thing all the time.
"At fifteen minutes eight, every day as clockwork, I came, and my bagel was made for me with oil and all the fillings," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes on the menu.
Rosenthal still makes a regular order today, but one day he'll change something with bacon, eggs, or cheese on a bagel with all the stuffings.
Rodriguez said he wasn't mad that the soap shop once took over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sherie offered to make special soap for Verba using coffee from a cold coffee shop as an ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer," Rodriguez said.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved the coffee shop.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to find a place for him in the window to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has other benefits.
The local juice-selling point plans to spill bottles and sell coldly prepared coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will be attached to a nearby building.
For many customers, it's enough that the new Verb will put their favorite foods on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client and shared that he was killed by grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened at a new location, Whitt said that by going inside and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
"How long I've wanted to smell that scent," he confessed.
Depression food depression in "The Swimming Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after ascending as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fashionable dishes on Fifth Avenue, such as foie gras and Meriland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and pruning pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are experts in food history.
Koua's last book, Ragu in Chinese, was devoted to Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of life in a rented apartment in the Lower East Side through food in her book Home 97 on Fruit Garden.
Their new joint work, The Pilot Meal, which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
While exercising some of their own cooking solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple diner in Flatairon quarter that has been working since 1929, the year of the Exchange Collapse.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with olive pieces, and Coe, 57, took turkey, potato mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for discussing food in the Depression era.
"Rulets were in great demand," Siegelman said.
There was peanut roll, liver roll, bean roll.
They were made of basic ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to be stretched.
Imagine eating as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe's blinking.
"It must have been a rock in his stomach," he said.
In the years before Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and fresh baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the starving Europeans during World War I. The Swimming Meal describes how the country coped with the fact that suddenly it was no longer a country of plenty.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult subject for Americans," Koe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget ration was similarly challenging: mysterious foods such as roulettes and cassering became staple foods; cassering was "a wonderful way to dispose of the scraps," Siegelman observed, because cooks could hide the non-appetitous ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
The meat, which has been the basis of American food for many years, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange blends because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even cooking common sense.
While doing research for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that era: baked onions stuffed with peanut butter.
"This supplement to the dinner table was not a success," Coe said.
Siegelman added, "It was very strange."
Peanut oil is completely inappropriate for baked onions.
This was typical of many homemade recipes.
As never before and ever since, homemakers — including Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 — managed the country's food habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budget creators", to accept the challenge, and to transform a burd of like rubbed spaghetti with carrots into delicious dishes.
"The Swimming Meal" is a feast of curious historical facts.
Especially spicy accounts of the government's reaction to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's position in the spirit of "let the pies eat."
Publicly praising the simple farming cooking of the state of Iowa during his childhood, he fed as a sophisticated millionaire who became.
"He liked continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe told him.
He ate almost in a gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake had his wife Eleanor not advised him to set an example with her own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was completely uninterested with the taste, and this resulted in the White House "using not only the saddest food in Washington, D.C., but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked."
Many of the cooking techniques of the Depression era were forgotten once the country was back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Siegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
The couple say that when writing the book, they better understood the food habits of Siegelman’s mother — that she could not throw away food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being negligent about food," Coe said.
Siegelman recalls, "She severely poisoned people."
There was one unfortunate case with the pros.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, he and Coe got dessert that they made at home: dessert from pruning, which President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a pruning mousse," Siegelman said, adding that it was a common technique - to give modest recipes catchy names.
There was no whipped cream, just prunes, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
All reluctantly loaded the spoon into a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was good.
Coe asked for more twice.
In the voice of a confident budget maker, he said to his wife, "A few ruble walnuts could use a little bit of it."
Arrest of the subjects of the Hovan Cemetery Mass Fighting case extended until 14 November
The Presne court left the subjects of the case of the Hovan Cemetery in custody until 14 November, granting the relevant request of the investigation.
There are 14 accused persons.
Let us recall that on 14 May there was a large-scale gun fight at Hovan Cemetery in Central Asia and North Caucasus, killing three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuev, and a lawyer, co-founder of the public organization Healthy Nation, Alexander Bocharnikov, are charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by Olga Holodec, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, during a visit to Bryansk Oblast.
We have specific parameters as to how much pension increases are needed to offset the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Economists are now taking a half-year to complete this work in the next two to three weeks," quotes Hunger Interfax.
Commenting on the proposed six-month increase in retirement age proposed by the head of the Strategic Development Centre, Alexey Kudrin, the Vice-Premier reported that the issue was not addressed in the Kabmin.
At the end of July, it was reported that the Government had agreed on a position for full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan passed the final of the small-caliber shooting competition.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Cyril Grigoryan passed the final of the small-calibre shooting competition from their position lying down at the Brazilian Olympic Games.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and ranked first - a new Olympic record in qualifications.
Cyril Grigoryan became the second - 628.9 dill.
A total of eight of the top athletes went to the finals.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition Fethullah Gülen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup d'état in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate an attempted coup d'état," quotes the French newspaper Le Monde, Gülen.
The Turkish opposition also stated that "if any part of the charges were confirmed, I would return to Turkey."
However, Gulen denies any involvement in the coup d'état, stressing that his organization had never claimed political power.
The Istanbul Court had previously arrested in absentia opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen.
Let us recall that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of 15-16 July.
Gilead companies will reimburse legal fees during a dispute for a patent from hepatitis C with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to receive reimbursement for legal fees it incurred in litigation over a patent for hepatitis C drug with drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc, a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was exempted from paying $200 million in damages for violating two Merck patents related to Gilead's medicines, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after an American judge discovered a number of irregularities by Merck, including sworn lies and other unethical acts.
At the court hearing on Thursday, U.S. Federal District Court judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to reimbursement for expenses incurred in challenging the claim.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case occurred in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work underlying the sophosbouvir, an active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
Armed forces established with U.S. support claim to have intercepted full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
Armed forces established with US support captured full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last remaining Islamic State fighters in the city left, a spokesman for the group reported on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants, told Reuters Agency Charfan Darwish of the Allied-SDF Manbij Military Council.
"City is now completely under our control, but we're doing sweep operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charity contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in performance fees, and the former Secretary of State announced a $3 million return from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure with the Department of State.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, released tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency," said election staff adviser Clinton Jennifer Palmiery in a statement.
In complete contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and violates his past promises to make his tax returns public.
It's common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers named the State Tax Service audit as a reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
"Your move," tweeted campaign advisor Clinton Jan Sams, referring to the Democratic Party candidate's declarations.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them before the checks were completed.
Critics of Trump, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican brothers in 2012, said his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grasped the issue and released an online video on Friday, placing the top priority on outstanding Republicans who persuaded Trump to disclose the tax report.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what each and every presidential candidate has done for decades: to release his tax returns," she said to the gathering.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump had paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday who believed that the case might still be in place.
The federal tax rates were the subject of a dispute in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after a billionaire, investor Warren Buffett, that would guarantee that people receiving over $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he was also under IRS scrutiny, and that Trump was "fearing" not tax agencies, but voters.
Clinton's elected headquarters released tax returns up to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, in New York City, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income came from wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons announced dividends and capital returns of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unconventional way to prevent elephants from ploughing into settlements — by throwing condoms filled with chili powder.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with this idea a few years ago, along with the American Nature Conservation Committee, took over its promotion, training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step way to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we invented a set of tools ... we have seen a change in the relationships within these communities, resulting in them being much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming elephants," Damian Bell, executive director of Honeyguide, said in a statement.
The first two steps are to light a torch in front of the breaking elephant and to signal with the horn.
If he can't be scared off, they throw away what's called a chili cloud.
Chili powder mixed with soil is placed with the clap in the condom, and its end twists, leaving only the wicket outside.
When incendiary, the condom bursts with thunder, spraying little dust of chili powder in the air.
One breath is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The ultimate measure is a trigger device that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Thirty-two Turkish diplomats who left the country after the attempted coup d'état in July of this year have still not returned to Turkey.
Such data were provided by the head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mevlüt Chavushoglu, in a conversation with local journalists.
In the first phase, we withdrew 208 staff diplomats to continue their work in the centre.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish foreign policy office.
Let us recall that in July there was an attempted coup d'état in Turkey.
The authorities have officially declared that the coup d'état has failed and have also reported the detention of more than 6,000 persons, including senior and middle-ranking military officials.
According to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 290 people died as a result of the coup d'état.
The Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's telephone code on an Arab "request" — reported RT News
The French director of Jewish origin unleashed a scandal in the media, discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have Israel's telephone code on the list, with employees referring to "requests" from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoa, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lantzman Hotel, he tried to find Israel on the telephone code list provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the States to which you can call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was expelled and eradicated?
He wrote Lantzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the issue at the hotel's administration counter.
The answer he received there was, according to Lanzman, "shocked him."
The hotel clerk said this measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel network."
The reason behind this move caused even greater anger on the part of the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that Israel's code be deleted," said Lanzman, a hotel employee.
The Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Jakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the case as "a terrible disgrace," reports the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany and this hotel network is even more disgraceful.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some have argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply "goes over" the alleged demands of Arab clients.
"To be ashamed," said another post indicating that the hotel located on the glorious street of Kurfurstendamm is near the synagogue.
The hotel itself rushed to dismiss any charges, calling what happened "inaudible" and "apologize" to Lanzman, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the rapid recruitment list," quotes the representative of the Kempinski hotel newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students faced the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered to protest government reforms of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse the students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students took part in a demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
As proposed by the Governor of São Paulo State, Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some protesters could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against interim President Michael Temer.
This last protest occurred just a few days after protesters massively took to the streets to support the suspended President, Dilma Roussef, when the country's Senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran grew by 71% – RT Business portal reports
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent over the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador Levan Jagarian to Iran.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is a growing interest on the part of Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies resume ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Jagaryan said.
He noted that trade between Russia and Iran had increased by 70.9 per cent over the same period in 2015 to $856 million in the first five months of 2016.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the Ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that Russia will receive a record number of Iranian tourists this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran entered the top 20 countries for the first time in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year's record for the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yad, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization remain in good condition," he said.
The state continues to twist nuts in the defense and industry complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the "systematic failure" of the director-in-chief of Almaz-Antey, the "missiveness of work" and the "loss of confidence".
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed as the head of the NGO for the next three years.
The news of Neskorodov's dismissal did not appear until Thursday evening and did not give rise to widespread media resonance.
How can such silence be explained in the context of the army’s massive rearmament?
It is likely that the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumours or negative assumptions in the public domain.
This confirms once again that the defence and industrial complex (DFC) has many problems and the State does not wish to attract greater attention from society.
The removal of Nestrodov is undoubtedly an important development in terms of order in the industry.
The NGO Almaz is a parent company of the company that specializes in the production of marine and land-based anti-aircraft missile systems.
Almaz is currently working on the establishment of the Poliment-Redut and Morpheus ZRC, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia portal, Dmitry Cornev, believes that Neskorodov's dismissal is due to a breakdown of time on these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the Morpheus development started as early as 2007 and was expected to be operational in 2013.
Poliment-Redut should be the main air defence system on the newest Navy ships.
According to the information I receive, no truly successful test has been carried out in a few years of testing.
The truth is, as far as I can tell, it's not exactly the diamond's fault, says Cornev.
The expert is concerned that the C-500 LAC may be delayed in commissioning.
The project has not yet been completed, but the first sets are due to join the troops during 2016.
The Department of Defense assures that "work is under way and everything will be completed within the prescribed time frame", although in 2014 the agency acknowledged that there were problems with the development of the C-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the competencies of Neskorodov, who has been running Almaz since 2011.
Cornev noted that project disruptions could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, it had become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in the PCOs and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and large amounts of money are known to love silence.
Generally, directors of defence companies resign at their own request, under a contract of agreement between the parties, or are reassigned to other jobs.
In this case, the suspension took place in public, although it did not receive any resonance.
This leads to the idea that the leader of the Diamond might have been a figure of strategist and resisted the top-down "orders."
It seems that such behaviour is no longer tolerated by the State.
With the hands of shareholders, it will suspend those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defence ' s policies and fail to fulfil its objectives.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation strives to punish repulsed managers (the "Star" shipyard schemes).
The President himself has given increased attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military Industrialization Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin defends the ranks of PKK managers in an effort to have a loyal composition of directors at hand that will carry out orders received from above.
This is not an ideal policy, but against the backdrop of rampant corruption and a lack of normal competition in RPCs, the State does not have other instruments.
The current situation in defence is certainly not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation encourages the Kremlin to bring the Armed Forces into order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “clean-up” of managers in the PKK, the Russian Federation leadership has taken quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The army's personnel acquired a new quality with the arrival of the Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoiga.
The president seems to have adopted the famous saying, "You want peace, prepare for war."
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which established Moscow as a sphere of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite well.
This was demonstrated by the absence of war on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the “winners” in the cold war eventually resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of attacks in Europe and the United States, there seems to be no quiet corner left in the "civilized world."
Despite the general trouble, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
Under such conditions, the fleet and army remain the only allies of our country.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to better defend national interests and to enter the new frontier of world politics.
Scotsman Callum Skinner runs through the finish line, resulting in British capture of bicycle gold
Scotsman Callum Skinner raced to triumph in a men's team sprint at a bicycledrome in Rio last night, resulting in a UK team trio defending its 2012 London title.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was as the strongest, which his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the youth proudly entered history by running through the finish line to rip the victory from the Favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed rights to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed rights to the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Track Cycling Championships in London, even though Hoy had since finished his career.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of the participant's specialist Jamie Staffe.
They did what they did at the time the Hindes appeared.
Hoy's departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to fill.
Skinner was a man held by British coaches, seeing potential in a Scotsman, which was now realized.
Hindes, Kenny – champions with Hoy four years ago – and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualification, but the norm was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation where Hindes was going on a larger show to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy observed from his seat as a BBC guest expert and caught Skinner's, Kenny, and Hindes' eyes as they stepped on the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and defeated the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After a triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes deliberately fell on the track after a failed start.
He later disavowed the comment, and there was no way to appeal from Britain's competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those flags of the UK on the stand."
We've all met like a team in the last three months.
We've lost so many races with a world name that winning the olympiad again was amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven of the 10 race titles in both Beijing and London.
If it is a barometer of progress made in the past five months, then the bicycle awaits another five successful days.
With the form demonstrated by Kenny, it is not beyond the ability to imagine how he repeats Hoy's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in one Games.
This would make it possible to see Kenny — who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (this seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday) — bring his score to six gold medals and one silver medal.
It would be just like Hoy's.
Next time, Kenny competes in a sprint that begins today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely winning alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must win knighthood."
It was the only medal play in a day, but there was further good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke, and Owen Dooll qualify as the fastest four-kilometre team race of four.
They finished for 3:51.943.
The world record for winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be the focus of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when officials demanded that he measure his weight.
In an appropriate women's event that resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rosell Shand, Elinor Barker and Kathy Archibald of Milngawi improved the world record by showing the time 4:13.260.
The UK team has come to rely on a strong cyclist team to own the middle period of the Olympic Games and earn a lot of medals.
After the real exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations were weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas on the second level, not the last, the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April due to allegations of sexism and harassment, and the departure of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first evening race at the bicycledrome, it seems that Britain's legendary now fame in reaching the summit at the right time may just happen again.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant is threatened by the cancellation of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland aluminium plant in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is threatened by the fact that the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant's owners, is about to terminate the delivery contract: it is planned that all delivery contracts will be terminated.
This step is the result of a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to renew the subsidies granted to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk at Alcoa's Portland factory.
A total of 2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — may be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed a metallurgical plant in Point Henry, leading to the closure of the Englesey power plant last year.
The Portland steel mill of Alcoa loses money and runs the risk of closing.
These actions were the result of thinking about the future of the plant, which has been going on for several years, initially because of the strong position of the Australian dollar and later because of the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant at Latrob Valley, reported that it expected the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contracts.
The controlling share of the plant is owned by a joint short-term enterprise of Alcoa and Alumina companies, and Chinese company CITIC and Japanese company Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, i.e. that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop," she said.
According to AGL, the contracts in question were so-called 'hedged contracts' that were to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"As a matter of fact, AGL still expects these contracts to bring their share of revenue in fiscal year 2017," said the electricity company.
Any potential impact on AGL's profits since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited to projections for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of the contracts in its report by $187 million in terms of "foreseeable termination".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to manage the metallurgical plant or to supply electricity to the metallurgical plant".
The American company stated that in 2010 it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to enter into force in November of this year, but that it had yet to explain why it had terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier this week, AGL Chief of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both plants withdraw from the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electricity].
For us, as a manufacturer, that would be bad," he said.
Not just Kardashian reality show star, Kendall on the cover of September's Vogue issue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of Cardashian-Jenner Mother Manager Chris, appeared on the coveted September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Eastee Lauder brand and disfiled during fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Being in the room with my favorite people, I looked at this cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The cover news was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of the Kardashian Family?) prepared reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (deboshires Rob and Caitlin, also joining them as the world's favorite show business uncle, producer of the Cardashian Family Ryan Seacrest), forgot about the sister appearing on the cover, and at the end a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
This is the standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to their birthday (Sicres utters the phrase, "Did you think we'd forgotten about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the program at 8:00 a.m.), but Chris needed this fame to go to other girls in one way or another.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered the new era of the Kardashian show.
Even though Kendall Kim's older sister was on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), the magazine's September cover is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is the best-selling issue of Vogue in a year.
With a thickness similar to a gift publication rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to the estimates of the Fashionista portal, 615 pages from last year's 832-page issue contained advertising).
News of which stars will reach his cover is expected so eagerly that in the past two years the magazine's photographs have been leaked before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "knowledges that work models" than "models that are celebrities."
The Oscar Award winner and the face of Dior brand Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gage's honour.
But even in the unlikely case, if Jenner, who was described by the magazine as an "excellent model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality-show stars or contemporary children who know how to make a good video at Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are really talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the best career years in connection with the release of Lemonade's album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, in view of her past television reality show stars, should always have remained fragile.
In June, one of Victoria's first models, Stéphanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment."
These moods have reburied after news of Jenner appearing on Vogue's cover.
But it doesn't make sense to dwell on dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defiling Mark Jacobs.
She sells you tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sells you her photos in her own subscription apps.
She sells handmade photographs of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, maybe to still see her sister Courtney and her kids, she's on a reality show on television.
Public law centres refuse to provide services to 160,000 persons per year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the least protected people are denied services at public law centres, as this sector is preparing for an effect that will further cut funding for activities already under way.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people unable to fight unfair deprivation of property, and so on — have already been refused in an attempt to obtain free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating outside the scope of the facility are preparing for further reductions.
From June of next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
Queensland Public Law Center Director James Farrell said that according to the latest census report of the National Association of Public Law Centers, thousands of people a year have been denied.
Farrell said that if the federal government's decision is not overturned, the situation will only worsen.
"Quinsland's public law centres are constantly receiving insufficient funding: this means that thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and bankrupt debts, families going through divorce, unfairly dismissed workers — all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means thousands of less protected Queensland residents will have to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately cancel these cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government met its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to focus on the needs of public law centres and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Palachuk Government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign office was sued after the staff member allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York City, Donald Trump's campaign headquarters was sued: the headquarters allegedly did nothing after reporting that his operating director in North Carolina had threatened a staff member with a gun while they were driving in a Jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday with the state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state election headquarters.
Bordiny said he waited months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized that "it won't happen."
Director Earl Phillip "retrieved a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pointed a blow at Vincent's kneecap," as Brady claims in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional office of the campaign headquarters, Bordiny realized that at least four more people had become participants in similar incidents with Phillip, it was claimed in the treatment.
"Pistols don't have to shoot to cause damage," said Bordiny in the complaint.
The lawsuit took place just two days after the Republican presidential candidate produced a furor, telling the North Carolina listeners that "the Second Amendment people" — understood as gun owners and his amateurs — could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could elect judges.
Trump's select headquarters said that the media had pulled his words out of context, and that he had not expressed support for violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign staff for negligent control, and Phillip for threats of physical violence, assault and moral injury.
Representative Trump Hope Hicks is slow to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left campaign headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one promptly called back.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg High Court Division, Charlotte.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring renaissance and prosperity not only in our localities here and throughout London, but also throughout the country.
To me, that was the huge advantage of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our peoples and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympic Games were of great benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we'll do it again, creating opportunities for locals and firms near Heathrow.
For our localities here alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
As was the case for London 2012, there will be those who think Heathrow expansion is too ambitious.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games, and that we would be in a difficult position on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will prove wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for most, not just for a narrow circle.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent team in Heathrow that has introduced the 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment program in time and within budget, from T5 — selected by the airport's top terminal five years in a row, to T2 built in the middle of the world's two most occupied runways.
They are now ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a huge success for the UK, and I'm sure Heathrow expansion will be, too.
It is time for us to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensuring our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton – Chairman of Heathrow Council and former Treasury Trade Attaché
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays cat-mouse on blocking ads
For companies that make money on Internet advertising, trying to bypass software to block advertising is a game of cat-mouse, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block advertising blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus published a blog record that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site would change the sign around its ads to make it harder for advertising blockers to recognize which parts of the page were advertising.
But Adblock now claims to be able to bypass the new code.
In his blog publication, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open source advertising blocker community and those who try to bypass it has continued since the invention of the blockage of advertising", and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social network has entered the struggle is a clear indication of how big the problem has become for advertising blockers for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to last year ' s study of Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times as many as those who used such software in 2013.
Considering 1.3 billion daily active users who enter Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 per cent of Facebook's advertising income.
However, the company hunts the table version blockers of advertising, as mobile blockers of advertising are ineffective in Facebook's mobile social media and Instagram apps, according to the spokesman.
However, the table version ads represent a sufficiently profitable article for Facebook to consider such a move a beneficial investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its "advertising preference" tool to give people more control over how advertising is targeting them.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that new Adblock filters were a matter of concern, as they would also block some non-advertising content on the website.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," said a Facebook spokesman in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a crude tool, so we instead focused on creating tools such as Advertising preferences to hand over control to people.
A woman moved on the Swiss freeway in an episode of apparent suicide.
The victim was on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police call witnesses after a woman moved several vehicles on the freeway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident occurred at A1 near the Morge in the canton of Vaud immediately after midnight on Thursday.
A woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, told the police in a statement.
In an apparent attempt to kill himself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several involved drivers have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and the police have informed them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case, a “logical” step in this situation, was initiated, as stated by counsel Gilé Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid hitting?
That's what the D.A. should determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case, both involving a person walking in the dark on the freeway, it was ruled that motorists could not expect an accidental encounter with a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on A1 near Payern at night in August 2014.
A 22-year-old sawer and passed out on the road, heard a trial.
The court found that a female police officer — who responded to an emergency call — was driving a vehicle that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was “perfectly exceptional and unpredictable”, the judge said.
Anyone who has information about an incident on Thursday near the Morges must call the police at 021,644 83 46 or 021,644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have been once inhabited, according to estimates of the new NASA climate model .
Scientists from the Nasov Space Research Institute Goddard developed a model for exploring the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether conditions like the earth could ever exist on Venus, with its hot water-free surface and atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide.
Scientists had previously assumed that Venus's slight rotation speed was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a diluted atmosphere similar to that of Earth, and still rotates slowly.
The model also considered the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and enough geographic variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent flat.
"According to the GISS model, Venus' slow rotations frame her daylight side to the sun for almost two months at a time," explained in a press report by the GISS scientist Anthony Del Henio.
This warms the planet's surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud layer, acting as an umbrella that protects the planet's surface from a substantial part of solar heat.
The result is average climatic temperatures, which are surprisingly a few degrees cooler than they are today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously suggested by planet scientists.
Although Venus may once have been inhabited, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapour was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When her hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a dense carbon dioxide atmosphere with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus, as we know her today.
Researchers shared the results of their new climate model Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves Avalanche team coach
Patrick Roy left as coach and vice president of the hockey activity Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
Executive Vice President / chief manager of the Colorado team Joe Sakick confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche hockey activities with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
During the summer, I spent a long and hard time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities must perfectly coincide with the vision of the organization.
He should also have the right to vote in decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of playoffs and had lost the playoffs for the past two years.
The Avalanche team announced a 39-39-4 score in the 2015-2016 season and five points behind the Wild team in the fight for a second favourable trip to the Western Conference.
The goalkeeper from Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two each with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oilers resume talks and suspend strike
Work strikes on oil salaries in the North Sea have been suspended, and all sides of the discussion are entering a new round of talks, reported by leading representatives of the parties.
Strikes against Wood Group oil service company were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and Unions Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes," says the joint statement.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting at the beginning of next week, to take a fresh look at the problems.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential wage cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group reduced the rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent this year due to negative market tensions.
The reduction in company rates followed a 10 per cent reduction in rates for shore-based contractual employees in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts would give it the space necessary to overcome the market recession.
Shell, for its part, reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in countries by up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities due to its mega-merging with the British power company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower prices for untreated oil: the economic situation has deteriorated due to the decision to withdraw from the European Union in June by Britain.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for most, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to the average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Pleiade cluster
Kepler's latest space telescope mission helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational speeds of stars forming part of the Pleiade cluster.
New data help astronomers to understand why stars in a cluster rotate at different speeds and how rotational periods relate to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Louise Riball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology in a press release.
The Pleiade Cluster is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are just reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning as fast as they'll never be again.
At their peak rotational speeds, these growing stars emit large amounts of star wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds produce a brake effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest rotational speed catalogue suggests that more massive stars rotate slowly than less massive stars.
Riball compares stars to dancers: larger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the ballet, Pleiades we observe that those who spin slowly, usually more massive, while those who spin faster are usually very light stars," Riball said.
As the Pleiade cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with rotational speeds.
"Pleiade's Star Cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of star rotation, both younger and older," Riball said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, where, and why stars slow down their speed and hang their "dance shoes" on the nail, so to speak.
Riball and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of Pleiade speed in three new articles to be published shortly in the Astronomical Journal.
Two agencies are investigating the activities of a group of Ukrainian subversive detainees in Crimea and writes "Commersant".
The FSB collects evidence of detainees' involvement in the preparation of diversions in Crimea.
As previously reported, a Ukrainian resident, Energodar Evgeny Panov, who had agreed to cooperate with the investigation, made a confession.
According to him, he considered Titan Chemical Plant in Armenian, Theodosia Oil Base, Kerchen ferry crossing, gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields as diversion facilities.
Law enforcement believes that not all the perpetrators of sabotage have been apprehended.
This, in particular, has led to the arrest of suspects in the Kiev Raisuda Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanislav Cherchesov was the head coach of Russia's football team.
At the meeting of the executive committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian football team.
The contract will last for two years, until the completion of FM 2018.
On 11 August, the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian football team.
He is a well-known footballer who formerly played goalkeeper in Moscow's Spartacus, as well as a coach with solid experience who mentored Russian teams such as the same Spartacus, the Pearl Sochi, Terek, Amkar, Dinamo, and the Warsaw Legia who won the country's national first and cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed as soon as possible and will last for two years.
It is thus his responsibility to prepare the team for the 2018 World Cup.
His coaching staff is known to include Miroslav Romašchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Pannikov.
There is information that the salary of the entire coaching staff is 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the media, the Russian Federation's leadership has set Stanislav Cherchesov's goal of bringing Russia's team to the semi-finals and winning medals.
As the coach himself stated, he considers as a priority the creation of a competitive environment within the team and intends to give the footballers an opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is pleased that the choice has come to him.
The first match, led by Cherchesov, will be held on 31 August in Antalya, which will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Let us recall that Leonid Slutsky previously served as head coach of the Russian football team, combining him with coaching at the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after a failed Russian national team performance at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the team's poor performance.
Overwhelmed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia has suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since independence from South Africa in 1990, that country, with a population of 2.4 million, has made tremendous strides, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is the Government ' s focus on education.
While people in developed countries take for granted free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries school fees are required in secondary and even primary schools.
Moreover, Governments are often advised to introduce training fees for “cost recovery”.
In Namibia, however, primary education is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also become free.
The authorities have also been active in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Contrary to the international trend of increasing inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini coefficient, a standard indicator of inequality in income distribution, fell by 15 points.
Back then, 23 years ago, it was one of the highest in the world.
And poverty fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) has also declined, from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest free speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The United States and other rich nations are far ahead of the United States.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the Corruption Perception Index, which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now that commodity prices are falling, Namibia has managed to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia also has some problems.
Unemployment, at least in traditional estimation methods, remains fairly high, at almost 28 per cent.
And like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS infection - almost 17 per cent of the population is infected.
According to World Bank estimates, Namibia is among the upper middle-income countries, but the authorities insist that their State is in fact a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The State has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
There are isolated nomadic hunter-gatherers living in deserts in the country, which in one way or another must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia had not given up, but it was addressing the challenges it faced.
Almost immediately after independence, power had been created to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
Notably, competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides affordable health care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians realized that they did not choose their neighbours, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, participate in regional health projects, encourage investment and exchange of students.
Furthermore, the Namibian Government has rightly considered that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to enriching the few at the expense of many.
The authorities are aware that Namibia ' s natural wealth needs to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacities.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek the maximum profit from the country ' s resources, and they are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to ensure that this is the case.
Transparency was crucial to that process, and strong government support for freedom of expression was so important.
According to Head of State Hage Heingob, media often say things he doesn't like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it has gained, says the President.
Not all of Namibia ' s key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, were renewable and the Government was making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia has shown that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings — racism, colonialism, inequality and underdevelopment — can embark on the path of shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and emulation.
Many have heard of the Golden of Varna, the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps it was the most high-profile archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavation of the Varnen Necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts - more than 3,000 total weight of 6 kilograms - was found.
Only one grave known as the "Mogil No. 43" resulted in the recovery of 990 gold items with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold may soon shift to the puzzling bead found by archaeologists in July this year.
Again in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunacite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunacite is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunacite of the Pazarjik district.
The bead is a gold strip wrapped in a ring.
Yavor Boyajiev, the leader of the excavation in Tella Yunacyte, dated the finding 4,600 BC and stated that she was older than Varna's gold by at least 200 years.
Warn’s treasures, let us recall, date from about the same period, 4,600 - 4200 BC.
There are currently no technologies that can date the metal with perfect accuracy.
How can you be sure which gold is more ancient?
Apparently, Professor Boyajiev knows more than he told Reuters agency, "I'm pretty sure Yunacyte gold is older than Varna gold."
It's a find of extreme importance: it looks like a tiny object, but it's big enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Boyajiev, scientists will soon analyse the composition of the metal as well as re-examine and more thoroughly the archaeological patch where the golden artifact was found.
This will help date the bead as accurately as possible.
The location explains a lot, too.
Tell Yunacite is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Tell Yunacite is now considered the oldest "city" of Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people migrating to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Over the next centuries, metal processing in the region has developed rapidly, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the establishment of a full-fledged industry.
Domestic history for this archaeological community has a special name: Balkan-Carpathian Metallurgy Province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban settlements began to emerge around metal processing centres.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunacite may be the oldest, as the artifacts of 4900 BC were found here.
I'd call Tell Yunacite a prototype of a modern city, although it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is a thousand years older than Schumer," says Boyajiev, referring to the generally accepted view that urban culture originated in the south of Mesopotamia, a modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the usual sense of the word.
The excavations of Telly Yunacite have been under way since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists dug up almost 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total settlement area.
Remains of the serf were found, once reaching three metres high.
There is little left of houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, urban dense development, “business centre” and residential suburbs.
Tell Yunacite is often called the Bird City: dozens of clay bird figures have been found here.
All birds are depicted in a state of rest, suggesting that they were not decorative objects but objects of local worship.
The Bird City was destroyed around 4100 BC - possibly by Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
The nomads had no towns, but they had horses and weapons.
The three-metre serf walls didn't stop them.
Archaeologists found obvious signs of a brutal slaughter: within the houses, remains of old people, women and children were found with traces of wounds inflicted by battle axes.
New findings and new facts appear every year, changing the usual understandings of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly referring not to individual cultures, but to the "lost" first civilization of Europe originating in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive to seek this civilization was the Golden of Varna, found relatively recently, in 1972.
It's logical that Varna's golden luxury should have been preceded by something-- some sort of tiny gold bead created in Tella Yunacite.
In Porsche, the 911 Targa model was artificially aged
It is officially stated that the training of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is done manually by unit specialists who work with serial machines.
The "retro-lock" consists, for example, in the special colour of the body Etna Blue, which was developed as early as 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, even the model logo is painted in that color.
In addition, the targa received a signature white graph along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel discs, as well as some body design details painted in "white and gold metal".
In the interior of the retro-drawers, it is noticeably smaller: it differs, in large part, in the grey-blue gamma of the design, new chairs with extended range of electrical controls, and separated black anoded steel threshold with a unit logo.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a gift car cover and a richly separated album with photographs of the production process.
The power plant of the Porsche Exclusive steel specialists does not touch the steel: the retro-targa is quite similar in characteristics to the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a 3.0 litre turbocharged engine developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be issued in limited circulation, but neither its volume nor the value of each particular sports car is reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers unleashed an "arms race"
The recent introduction of Facebook technology to prevent advertising from being hidden on social media pages has provoked decision makers to block advertising from responding.
AdBlock Plus released an anti-venom, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon as well.
So AdBlock Plus advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
Social media representatives noted that, in an attempt to deceive the new technology of "non-blockable" advertising, the decision of AdBlock Plus, along with commercial advertisements, blocks many regular posts from friends or pages.
Facebook deplored this policy of AdBlock Plus and promised to resolve the problem soon.
As a source among the social media developers of TechCrunch, the code making AdBlock Plus useless on Facebook's desktop website will be ready within the next hours.
So the social media and the blockers opened up a sort of "arms race," trying to beat each other, the injured side became users who missed interesting recordings from friends or saw ads where they weren't used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of blocking advertising in recent times have been highly controversial.
In Murmansk, the rapist will stand trial · Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been completed in the Russian Federation's Murmansk Investigation Committee.
The charge against a 54-year-old man is very serious - sexual assault.
The investigation found that, at the end of November 2015, the accused in the Pavlova Street area of Murmansk committed acts of a sexual nature with violence against a 20-year-old girl. A criminal case with a confirmed indictment was sent for examination on the merits.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum penalty of up to six years ' imprisonment.
Dongfeng will bring the Fengguang 370 crossvan to Russia and Rich New's pickup site Driving www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of China's popular car class combining minivan and crossover merits.
Another alleged Russian premiere is Rich New's pickup truck.
Many Western firms of the Moscow International Autosalon have decided to ignore this year, so the emptiness of Crocus Expo's exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the Dongfeng Motor Corporation will be a powerful front, with large types in the Russian market and with the intention of offering some interesting novelties to our auto lovers in the near future.
One of these will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 cross-van, marketed in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (just under 550,000 rubles at current rates).
Russia is unlikely to have such a value, and the issue of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370, following June sales, managed to reach number 11 on the list of best-selling minivans, although in view of the large road clearance (175 mm) and the protective plastic overlay on the lower perimeter of the body, it may well be listed as crossovers.
Crosswan is built on the forward-wheel drive platform of the younger Fengguang 360 model, the 370th having the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4,565 mm versus 4,510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The hall is decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical touch screen "like Tesla's" on the central console was only on the early exhibition copies of the crossvan, and the cars with "music" were easier to sell.
Five of the seven landing places are easily folded, forming a smooth loading area with a length of 1,650 mm and a maximum trunk volume of 1,500 litres.
The Fengguang 370 engine is only one - 1.5-litre 115 hp petrol "atmospherer" connected to a 5-speed manual gearbox.
On the dynamic qualities of the machine, the manufacturer modestly silences, but promises a penniless owner's budget appetite of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Rich New pickup is a well-known Russian NP300 Navara from the previous generation, but with a slightly improved Chinese style design.
Despite its morally outmoded design, the model still enjoys a steady demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and untapped "workhorse".
At a similar price, Rich New will certainly be interested in Russians, because modern Japanese pickup trucks have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines by choice: petrol 2.4 l (137 hp) or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 hp).
The gearbox is just mechanics, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a rigidly plugged front.
He will be on the Dongfeng stand and the new A9 flagship sedan, his Russian Premier's representation of a Chinese firm announced as early as June.
There are more and more minivan-like crossovers in the Chinese market, some of the latest developments - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
The Russian Dongfeng line is currently made up of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
In the seven months of this year, Chinese dealers sold 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notices will stop sending mail - website Driving www.zr.ru
The tax inspection changed the procedure for issuing notices of property taxes.
All Russian auto owners are used to an unchanging scheme: they receive mail receipts for the previous year's transport tax in the summer and autumn.
However, many of them will not wait this year.
The fact is, the tax inspection has easily changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
Those registered with the Taxpayer's Personal Cabinet on the official website of the nalog.ru office will receive notices electronically.
Inspections automatically considered such Russians as online users and deleted them from standard, "paper" mailings.
The innovation will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will continue to receive their usual letters.
However, the owners of the account on the website also have the opportunity to return to the old scheme.
To do so, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more comfortable.
The notification will appear in the “personal office” as soon as it is completed, while the letter will go on for a few days and may be lost at all.
In addition, the number of Internet service users of the tax inspectorate has passed for 18 million people, allowing the agency to save heavily on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection site is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the changed order.
Some may have registered in the “personal office” to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait to be notified in the mail and, without knowing, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the Taxpayer's Personal Cabinet is made in three ways: through the Gosuslugi.ru portal account, by electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified on the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person from any branch of the Tax Inspectorate (regardless of the place of registration).
We recall that this year the transport tax must be paid before 1 December.
Notifications began in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, in which the improvements are aimed at achieving very high returns, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not embarrass the masters of G-Power, who took up the modification of the Mercedes-AMG G63 sports version.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human is alien to its masters.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - 571-strong flying sledge with tank aerodynamics and up to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Inflating the "musculars" of a mad "helicus", the masters took advantage of the advantages offered by the 5.5-litre inflatable "eight."
But the rate of dispersal up to 100 has improved by indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "kirpitch" is capable of leaping in 5.3 s.
However, the accelerations from the average speeds are probably better for him.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G63 is faster than 210 km/h does not drive, a tuning all-road vehicle with a deactivated electronic "shake" can squeeze 250 km/h.
Outside, the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory source, except for other wheel discs - 23-inch Hurricane RR dimension 305.35 ZR 23.
Mercedes-Maybach's suite announced an amazing concept coupe 6 m long that will be presented as part of the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the "green subbrand" BMW i and will promote its electrical models under a separate trademark.
A minimum of four green innovations are expected in the coming years.
