Parliament does not support the amendment giving freedom to Tymoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, in the course of amending the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected an attempt to repeal an article that condemned the opposition leader, Yulia Tymoshenko.
An amendment that would have led to the release of the former Prime Minister in prison was rejected during the second reading of the draft bill on the commutation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be disadvantageous.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will hear Tymoshenko's appeal in December.
Tymoshenko claims that the sentence is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the trial was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the former Prime Minister had been convicted, had been supported by 147 members of Parliament.
Ratification would require 226 votes.
Victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya already has losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert, and without him the war is over.
It is time to identify the winners.
It is common for Islamists to prevail in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself to be a follower of the ordinary law of Shariat, which we have already heard of.
Libya will become a country without crime, for the punishment for theft is the cutting off of hands.
Women may forget emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and which we would hardly wish for.
In any case, our way of life is neither unique nor the best, and would most likely not suit, for example, the people of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted assistance from non-believers.
Their only excuse is that they believe that NATO's raids were not directed by an American general, but by God, whose greatness they celebrated after each strike.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of profit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to renounce the military occupation of Libya.
Local populations therefore need not worry about the expulsion of the Crusaders.
Although without occupation, would oil companies receive Libyan black gold for almost no price?
They probably won't, and the West will finally be proud of the selfless protection of civil rights.
Unless Shariat's followers end it.
A new wave of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe are now the focus of investors.
A statistical storm swept over Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries released data on GDP in the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnant, Germany and France are showing growth.
Still, the debt market is breaking records today.
Investors are already looking not only at Italy; they have now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
German GDP grew by the expected 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, where Germany was doing better than expected (a 0.3 per cent increase instead of the original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (the initial information implied stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth rate of 1.5 per cent.
However, GDP remained stagnant compared with the previous quarter, which, according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, confirmed the trend towards a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it remained stagnant compared with the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany's economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the Eurozones and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2 per cent over the previous quarter, which coincides with the forecasts of analysts.
Greece's economy showed a preliminary decrease of 5.2%.
Its 10-year bonds have a revenue of 28.45 per cent.
The income of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, Czech 1-year bonds remain at around 4%.
In Germany, it is said that the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech team was selected in EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1–0 and celebrate an unexpected 200 million cash prize.
The national team successfully managed the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Chech and the beautiful goal of Peter Yiracek, they won 1–0.
In the second half, the Czech team was fortunate to retain a significant advantage after a home match, and she will participate again in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz observed the match and drew up a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and great luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the team's defeat at the end; the great Czech; and heroic Jiraček; won 1–0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Championships.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the Montenegrin team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damjanović and Vučinić became the most unsuccessful couple of the match after missing two great opportunities.
Great Peter Chech is one of the reasons the Czech national team won't miss the European Championships next year, and Czech football will make about 200 million Czech kroner.
From the first minute, the game was very stressful.
Both teams experienced difficulties with the combinations; the game spent most of the time in the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the masters' team in the first half, and long-range strikes beyond the defence line were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They've created a human shield.
Several hundred university students have set up a human shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
In so doing, they wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday at noon, the student prayers before entering the building were followed by a moleben of the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students set up a human shield around the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Plant.
In this way, they have demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at the cost of their own lives.
In its most recent report, the International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that everything showed that Iran had not abandoned its attempts to acquire nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
Tuesday at noon, students' prayers were followed by a moleben of the death of both the United States and Israel at the entrance to the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Plant.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysing of the Iranian nuclear programme, the Israeli press has indicated that the facilities in both Isfahan and Natanza, where uranium enrichment is being carried out, will be targeted.
Nutrition of Obese Children: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 weigh more than the norm; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5 per cent suffer from obesity.
According to a recent study, children suffering from obesity usually come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle.
We see once again the importance of the environment and behaviours associated with a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears on the tables of children suffering from obesity almost twice as often as in families with children of normal weight.
More than 19% of children suffering from obesity ate fries for dinner on the eve of an educational event called Obesity is no accident.
Moreover, families of children suffering from obesity do not engage in sports, but this is true for most families of modern schoolchildren - only 15 per cent of children said that their parents find time to exercise at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of the last school year, with almost 900 pupils attending elementary classes throughout Bohemia.
Obesity was not an accident for the second consecutive year, with the support of the insurance company Všeobecná zdravotní pojişōvna and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 students in grades 4 to 8 have joined the project.
Adequate nutrition and sufficient sporting burdens are the main determinants of the rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either overweight or obesity.
"For example, only half of those interviewed said they eat five times a day, according to the breakfast-dinner-dinner-dinner-dinner scheme, which is one of the essential conditions for proper nutrition," says one of the findings of the study.
No lunch and sausage in the evenings.
Experts warn that even relative details such as the constant time of family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school-age families have breakfast together.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast separately.
The worst discovery was that in every tenth family, people don't eat breakfast at all.
Yet, breakfast is the basis of the right daily diet.
The study found that fried food is more commonly used in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet cool drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly participate in sports, this figure falls by more than half, to 15 per cent, when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to draw up their own menu based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from the ideal of healthy nutrition".
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat, and sweet foods.
"A particular concern is the high popularity of sweet cool drinks," says the final part of the study.
As the main lunch dish, the paste defeated the bird with a small margin.
However, children showed little interest in bean, fish and vegetable dishes.
Seeking a Healthy Lifestyle
The study also showed that children are willing to change their eating habits, provided that they are provided with relevant information.
"Many members of the test group have shown a significant shift in preferences towards healthy food when they filled out a questionnaire after the lecture was completed Obesity is not an accident," the project's outcome states.
This was particularly evident, for example, in the case of sweet cool drinks, with more children preferring just water to them.
In addition, children have more often mentioned poultry and fish as the main food, limiting the amount of sweet foods and pastries.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, claimed professionals
In the first article on stylist training, I visited the amount of information in induction classes.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in this field; advice on the choice of clothing for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how all this works in real life.
Next, more.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks we're going to have.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time with Alenka, director, (no man in the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not fully symmetrical.
One short neck, another boy's figure without proper shapes, another weighs more than the norm.
The stylist must know how to visually reduce broad shoulders, extend the neck, or add missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to emphasize the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, who have more plentiful breasts and thighs and narrow waists, without wearing them too challenging.
For example, if the difference in waist size and thigh size is so large that you can't pick a skirt or trousers, you should have at least one thing sewn on order.
You will certainly not regret the investment, because the perfectly seated clothes are priceless.
In an order-made skirt, you'll feel much better than the one that keeps moving out, rolling in, exposing your waist, etc.
The holders of boy figures, on the other hand, may wear clothes with ruffles, application, embroidery or folds.
Given the wealth of such information and shapes, I'm glad I have a whole week to understand all this.
And yet, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we got.
Each participant in the course had to come up with two outfits for a celebrity, one for the day and the other for the evening.
We have to take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothes, and the type of figure.
I have to wear Miranda Kerr, which you may know on Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy about myself because it's much easier to dress than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguiler, who recently recovered to a ton (please bear in mind that I'm exaggerating), or a very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them online, print and process them using graphics programs.
Mudboard - that's what the work is called - then reflects our own style and attitude to graphic representation.
It is important to keep the graphics of the style in mind.
The stylist not only dresses real people, but creates grocery pages in magazines (based on special instructions such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what stylist and designer Mario Camenic told us.
But it wasn't until Sunday.
The stylist needs common knowledge.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about the type of figures, was revived by three visitors, specialists in the field.
Stylist, Honza Pogorny; fashion designer, Jakub Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a training coat can be worn normally, on top of jeans and T-shirts like a coat; but it can also be worn on a naked body, without fastening as a dress.
Another possibility is to roll up your sleeves or lift your collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Toy with him," he stressed.
In any case, I appreciated the following advice most: "For your work, you must know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them,' said Jakub.
Here, I finally realized why we were grinding all the definitions and rules, what to combine with and why, whereas in fashion magazines we often see a different one.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist should have more outfit options on his hands than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a fashion view on ten pages (equivalent to ten outfits), I have to be prepared to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, an item of clothing often looks and works in combination with others in a very different way than in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pocorna confirmed that often image and style are half success.
Just look at Madonna, who has no amazing vocals, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude towards the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even prominent people often find it unnecessary (and believe it's enough to be a specialist in something, and what they look like a second time).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we have to expect them to give us a different (less) size than they really wear.
Then we turn to Google and see if the tabloids have written anything about some celebrity being fat/died, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it was not enough for a stylist to know fashion and be able to pick up a outfit.
Our work consists mainly of communicating with the people we dress; it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to condone them and to hold to their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw away all of her wardrobe, telling her that her clothes are terrible."
"Find at least a few things you can praise and advise what you can wear with them" says Mario.
He also showed us that he should have a working bag in particular.
It's a bag you tie around your waist to wear everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, sticky rollers or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylists use it when filming certain items, such as bags or hats), special clips to attach tissue to the back if the clothing is too large (carves and similar items are prohibited because they spoil clothes) or sewing kit.
In order to distract ourselves from the lectures and gain some practical experience, we learned to do the right shoe linings.
Even when filming in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged, not to mention the shooting on the street.
And here we go with the sticker.
You don't have to touch your shoes with scissors so you don't ruin them.
It takes real skill.
I was glad Mario praised my work.
I didn't like the skills mentioned.
It's only part of what we've heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn't that easy, no matter what they say.
V Need for Speed: Escape occurs in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work due to a series of totally inappropriate and careless mistakes.
Ambition to some extent was satisfied, but it doesn't matter, as no one clearly wanted to do extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the subheading "Escape", there was a lot of hope.
It was expected to move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; the demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the racing genre.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main character gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end, much is different from what we expected.
The game is a fairly good arcade race, but the general impression is corrupted by a few unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
Which means, in reality, it's not a mistake, it's an unexplained lazy development.
The adventure begins very well.
You become part of a story whose main character, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
This idea has some interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race goes along its own route, individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So it doesn't feel like the same thing happens in the game all the time.
Although the graphs are at the same level as in previous parts of the series, it is nice to see some tracks.
Yet, the game does not give rise to strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, it is a pleasure to drive through the autumn suburbs or high in the snowy mountains.
In addition, the race occasionally revives an unusual detail.
In the desert, for example, you are caught in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful not to fall under the avalanche.
The individual races are quite well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while you're trying to outrun several rivals (in essence a regular race); then you're trying to improve time (standard race with a secondomer); or you're competing with one opponent.
Among other things, you run into the police from time to time, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's no big deal.
Although surprising, these fragments are much smaller than you could expect (only three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out to be good for the game because it's not boring; given all the above, it's one of the things that makes the game interesting.
The racing model is following the tracks of previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a deficiency.
If you're looking for a simulation of real life, you're going to have to look elsewhere.
Yet, this model of driving is very suitable for dynamic races, although better options can be found in the market.
So far, so good.
After a while, however, problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don't expect complex transformations and confrontations from this game, but if you have no idea what your car is going to do before you hit an object, something's wrong.
Normally, overtaking or passing cars in a dense stream, you sometimes touch another car slightly, and yet sometimes in a virtually similar situation, your car starts to spin wildly.
Or she broke up.
It's not important because of the restart system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
The restarts are designed so that if you break up or go far off the track, the game brings you back to the point where it stopped.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the start.
It's helpful if something doesn't work out, but you can't rely entirely on it.
Sometimes restarts are not enough, and you have to learn by heart a separate section of the race.
An important shortcoming of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be made in a certain way, or you just won't fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian vehicles in a certain location in the same configuration, regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds early or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations where you see your opponent easily passing between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you are there, cars are already positioned so that you need either to bypass them or to drop your speed.
It doesn't matter when you're near them; it's all arranged that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game, you discover several places where, regardless of time, the same opponent overtakes you in the same place.
It's particularly obvious at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you're driving in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent should stand before you no matter what.
The thing is, when he's driving in front of you, he's making you look worse, leading to one or more accidents on this site.
You can understand trying to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's rapidly starting to cause irritation.
It's a shame, because despite a simple driving model, the game is interesting and sometimes so full of events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what keeps you from missing-- a concept with 50 unique tracks, a sequence of races or something.
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual.
You need to keep track of gas stations on the way, because that's where your car can switch, even though in most cases the one you already have is enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are for straight sections of the highway; and exotic super sportscars for technical driving, such as curved mountain tracks.
The main history mode is closely linked to the challenge mode mode; it is a race on individual plots that you will learn in the course of the game.
Here you win for your personal affairs both medals and points common to the Challenges and Story modes.
Many possibilities are available to obtain a higher level of driving, ranging from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is related to the online function of Autolog, which, among other things, compares your performance with that of other players, and provides communication to the public.
This is another weakness that is difficult to understand; it is an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car enter the subway tunnel (let's say so) where you run on the tracks in the dark (let's say so).
Your speedometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let's say so), when suddenly a subway train hits you from behind, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For a few days, our editorials discussed whether no one really thought a second at the time of the game's creation, or whether its creators really think we're such jerks.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression from the video order is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
Although it is unfortunate that, at some critical moments, the quality of recording is sometimes quite high, it is declining.
This is particularly true of incidents involving a large number of participants, where a good recording would not help you very much, either.
Sound's fine; soundtrack's on the amateur.
To please as wide a youth audience as possible, songs from different styles have entered into the soundtrack; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
The general impression of Need for Speed: The run is rather disorderly.
If the game avoided obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the game leaves a sense of unfinished business.
Of course, it's a good entertainment, but prepare yourself for the defects to blind you as a searchlight for the airport.

Ambassador to the EU, Wicenova:
The Czechs have a reputation for disloyalty and skepticism towards the euro.
"Lisbon Treaty caused considerable controversy among individual organizations".
"I didn't expect such a brutal war to happen."
"It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes in any way, calms down and all players get used to their new roles", EU Ambassador Milena Wicenova rigidly started her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She proved how much she adheres to her motto "Screen and Open about Europe" in the first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so easily and understandable that many lecturers from the CU Law School would be envied.
Moreover, Wicenova praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompei:
"At first critics were said to be an ordinary grey office mouse who cannot perform any role; I must say, everyone was amazed at how well he had done his role."
"He is a man who can listen at the same time to twenty-seven member countries, has excellent communication with them and has a clear idea of which way the EU should be developed."
She explained her new position as a representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question: “Who is the European Union? Which number do I need to call?”; i.e., how an important step towards harmonization and greater transparency of the Union’s policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheeses.
Vicenova went on to focus on the program key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the Czech presidency a success the previous year.
The Czechs were dealing with the impending financial crisis; they overcame the crisis and organized an East Partnership summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at the time was a negative phenomenon that had caused great damage to the Czech Republic.
The Czech representatives in the EU are currently very busy.
As the Ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have caused the ongoing fermentation.
In addition, a new EU seven-year budget must be adopted, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and economical, which areas would be preferred; which countries would receive more support and which countries would receive less; all those issues were in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans that she had brought to Brussels: “On Europe, the Understandable Language”.
"I really don't like cuts, foreign words, and jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that people in Brussels are not trying to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese varieties?'
It also intends to make better use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe — Our Future
The Ambassador argues that the Czechs are considered to be Euro-skeptics; as well as people who note the negative rather than the positive aspects of things.
She wants more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are responsible: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful chairmanship of the Czech Republic, it noted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the Slovak joins us, the French say to me, "Hey, what's the meeting about, the Visegrad group again?" and he's not happy about it.
In the future, the Vicenova Union expects largely new strict rules for the budgetary policies of the States Parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considered the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area, and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it has been said that countries that want to unite, while those that do not want to stay away."
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe," awaits Vicenov.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompei in advancing the rule that all issues related to the whole EU should be discussed by all participating countries, not only those of the Eurozone.
Brand History:
IBM's innovator enters the second century of its existence.
If anyone wants to find a word that best expresses IMB's strategy, the closest is likely to be "long-lasting."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded over a century ago.
The company's long-term viability was laid down by its first boss, dreamer Thomas J. Watson, Sr.
He believed in his motto that many of the world's problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant unfolded (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of the corporate culture Watson carefully built.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her original values, though she was not afraid to change everything around herself.
In our first hundred years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business, and company.
In the second hundred years we hope to achieve even more," says current company manager Samuel J. Palmisano on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care just as Batya in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniform, and a complex system of bonuses for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The long-term relationship of IBM with consumers is similarly advanced.
From the beginning, the company had been brilliantly used by talented people, one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it an excellent choice.
Concurs with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, according to which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmisano next year.
She has worked for IBM for thirty years; she is currently Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
For the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, during which many future innovations emerge.
No wonder there's a lot of ideas - about half a million people working in the company.
Organization with a good reputation
The firm's strong position in business is ensured by strong internal and external image.
"From the outset, from the point of view of the IBM concept, was more of an organization than a technology company," said the Economist Professor of Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabet Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it is a company that helps solve business problems using technology," adds George Colony of Forrester Research consulting company.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between going to the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as he is called in the United States because of his logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most universal technology company -- developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services -- from servers to nanotechnology.
She owns the largest number of patents among all U.S. technology companies, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a bar code and a diskette.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM this year became the second-largest technology company (the first to have an Apple company), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look Forward
Not all of her products came to buyers' tastes and fit into the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; Prodigy online service; and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is driven forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundations on several platforms -- if they don't work, it gives them up.
It is thus different, for example, from its Microsoft competitor, who is based and experiencing a fall on Windows, its operating system.
Forward-looking technology
IBM's main income comes from services, about one fifth in each case coming from computer programs and hardware.
While in 1990, with capital of half, it was the strongest equipment manufacturer.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion, while it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued its investment even after 2008, when the current economic crisis struck the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the years of the Great Depression.
Until IBM seems to have damaged the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM stock prices have risen by a record 120 per cent; the company's net earnings have increased steadily.
The corporate motto of IBM is to change everything except your own values.
Therefore, even if another crisis strikes, this flexible giant can be expected to deal with the situation.
History of IBM: From cheese knife to space missions.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York 100 years ago, and its original name "Compilation Corporation, Tabulation, Records" was quite complex.
It took the name IBM in 1924, originally called the brand used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were laid by the merger of four companies whose history begins in the 1880s.
They possessed technologies such as legendary "tough watch", i.e. clocks recording the time when employees come and go to work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who also headed the company's board of trustees until 1930.
Flint hired the director of the rival company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then moved the founder of IBM into the shadow - Watson's ideas remain the basis of an unshakeable corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as is clear from the title, started from the production and sale of various business equipment, ranging from cheese knives and meat cutters to cash machines.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, revenue doubled to $9 million, and a large-scale expansion of the company to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that after almost forty years, his son, Thomas Watson Jr., took his seat in the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA monitor space missions to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, a human flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, IBM line System/360.
A classic PC that defined computer standards at the time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of the computers to Lenovo, while buying the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting office, thus entirely focusing on consulting and high-value-added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great strides with its concept of the Smart Planet.
Its objective is to make reasonable use of technology in areas where it has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban management.
In the area of commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smart Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be located simultaneously in central and eastern Europe, IBM founded its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also manages a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague, where a world-level research group on speech recognition also operates.
Richtarzhova about her unfaithful husband:
Yveta, keep the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzhova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Josef Richtarge (53) became the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has set clear rules for her future life.
"Pep can come home, but no longer as my partner," explained Richtarzhov.
When Darina Richtarzhova provided the shelter of Bartoshova in her home in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she forced Iveta to leave Rjichan after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After a while, Darina surrendered, pretending to accept her husband's affair; and now she finally forgave him.
Richtarju doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richtarge and Bartoshova ever break up, his wife won't accept him with open arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will kick him out."
"However, he will end his days not as my favorite, lost and found old fool, but as a man with whom I have a connection," said Richtarzhova, adding that she had already been freed from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
As long as Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'll be with Yveta, I'm not going to change that."
"My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union continues to function; I am responsible for repairing, gardening, home and shopping".
"Darina and I communicate perfectly normally, only we don't share a bed anymore," said Richtarge to Black magazine.
He claims that if Richtarzhova finds a new love, he won't bother her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has a boyfriend with.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yveta and I have full responsibility," concluded Joseph.
Worst Women's Addictions: Do They Touch You?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually immediately list them all.
Dear ladies, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, describing a few women's habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your other half complains about you guys shopping all the time?
Do you have to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping at big sales?
If so, your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for shopping somehow.
And yet, which one of you will refuse to take a walk to the clothing stores in search of perfectly seated clothes and to try it on (preferably in different color variants) in the dressing rooms?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it may become a living hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait for you outside...
Eternal Disgrace
"I'm too fat?"
"I need to drop at least five kilos, maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you join a group of women who are obsessed with their appearance.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men literally get allergic to the partner's constant complaints about their appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more such complaints arise, the more women annoy them.
Most importantly, order and purity
It's like an endless story.
Glass washing, vacuum cleaning, floor cleaning, dust cleaning, bath cleaning, at least twice a week.
Are you criticizing your partner for stepping on a clean tile in dirty shoes; children for mud in a clean sink and fingerprints on a window glass in the living room that was so hard to clean?
If you are suffering from this "diversion", try to realize that it is not good to fall into extremes; and that order and purity should not be at the top of your family.
A harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationship as well as your entire family.
Desiring to Command
"Throw your underwear to the basket".
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet dish towels should not lie on the floor".
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps if men understood that, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Gossip
Some women like to gossip, insult, and intrigue others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how and why.
Every now and then, I guess each of us is gossiping.
Let's be frank, that seems to be the nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gossipers, women who often gossip and despise the others, and they, especially in the women's work force, pose a great danger to their surroundings.
The result of Yagra and Doctoric broadcasts helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful assists by hockey striker Yaromir Yagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on Carolina ice. He again became the most effective Czech player in the match.
In both cases Claude Giroux used the experience of a thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another gear and was declared the best player in the match.
The two successful assists of the match also belonged to the team-player Yagorg Yacouba Doctorek.
After the match, Yagra told foreign journalists that he had predicted a great evening for Giroux.
"I told him before the match he'd score a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel these things," explained the Yagra, after whose actions Giroux scored at the first opportunity Flyers gave.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a "Czech trail".
The closing Harrickains Voracek took possession of the puck and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the circles.
The second before the first break home player Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap with a numerical advantage, but at the beginning of the second half, Flyers were driven again.
Especially Giroux.
After Jagra's effective pitch, he scored a third goal; his hit was later transformed into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best league player, but he's definitely in the top three," said the Yag, commending his center.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it's my turn," added the Yagra.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer's penalty, reducing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger acted well in our zone".
"He hit the puck, I accelerated, and Reid moved to the far edge."
"I was aiming at him and glad it worked," described Voracek's impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to first place in the Eastern Conference.
The team's defender of the Montreal Czech team, Jaroslav Spáček, did not complete the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an injury to the upper body.
Along with an experienced defender, Canadiens lost his two-point advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penalties.
Tomas Pleckan couldn't score during one of their attacks.
More than lost glasses, the home coach was upset by the large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad".
"We finished the match with just one experienced player, the others were young people".
"Anyway, there's nothing we can do about it, just have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We needed to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
"What was our weakness," added defender P.K. Subban
After thirty attacks, Czech goalkeeper Onjay Pavelets helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
Jets' goals, which interrupted the five-match series of defeats, were scored by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Prior to 1989, only five public tourism agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
As travel to the West was severely restricted, travel agencies at that time mostly sold tours to socialist bloc countries.
Thus, Czech tourists travelled to the German Democratic Republic for holidays; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime turned towards the West, causing considerable restrictions on Czech tourists travelling to Yugoslavia.
A great paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually in socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel on his own, for example to the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from that country was needed; another individual journey was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered travel to the West, but it was either necessary to stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or to have "good friends" at the agency.
And that wasn't all.
The currency permit was necessary for travel to the West, and it was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without currency permission, it was impossible to obtain money (Western currency) for travel to the West.
The Czechs most often spent their vacations at home, resulting in a large number of cottages and summer houses, a habit that continues to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic thus survived a real revolution.
While pre-1989 leave in the GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox, which we no longer realize, is that until 1989 we could not freely visit Croatia, the most popular currently, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In early 1990, the need to obtain a visa to neighbouring countries of Western Europe was cancelled, triggering a huge wave of short trips, mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't get enough travel to the West, and everyone wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in the parks in tents because their income at the time was insufficient for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring in their own food (conservatives, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech crown, and after decades, our tourists are finally free to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income increased, leading to another important development around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled travel agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines; compared to the past, air travel has become extremely cheap because of the ability to book wholesale discounts.
By the late 1990s, Czechs did not need a visa to visit virtually every developed world other than the United States, which made our travels even easier.
The next significant event in travel history after the revolution took place in 2000, with large demand leading to the historically first straight charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have taken Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flights from the Czech Republic will take twelve exotic directions.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another important event of this period, which symbolizes our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. lifted the need for a visa for Czech tourists, and our country has thus become a permanent member of the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in history in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their leave abroad (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during their leave abroad, including their expenses at destination.
The general assembly must choose the president, the threat to the pata returns
For about five months, Czech football did not have a president; there is a risk that Ivan Gasek's successor, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburk on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on the rules to be followed in elections.
Without this, one of the three candidates will not proceed.
Yindřich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomás Pazlik want to lead Czech football.
As he left his post in June, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
Nevertheless, the era of Gaseka once again plunged football into strife between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became very clear on September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the general assembly came to the National House in Prague, Smikhov, for no reason, since the negotiations remained blocked, not just the election procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote at the general meeting - only the legal representatives or also the officials to whom the powers had been granted.
This point has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Rights, according to which representation based on authority is not possible.
Disputes over electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Council has also not been very helpful, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it is mainly concerned with this issue.
The ways of voting were changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: How do you go to the 3rd round and avoid the pat?
"The dispute is whether to follow the established standards or find another model," says one of FAČR's vice presidents Dushan Liberty, who represents professional football in the association's office.
Based on the statutory model, the winner of the third round is a candidate who has received much support from the Chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is said to agree to compromise that the candidate with the largest number of votes in both houses is considered the winner of the election.
The Czech side insists on the condition that, in the overall percentage, the winner must win at least two thirds of the vote.
"Therefore, the previous two rounds would have lost their meaning; that would have completely rejected the concept of the two chambers," Freedom agrees with Moravia's arguments, he says it would be better not to change the rules and vote according to existing rules.
A bit unexpectedly, Tomáš Pazlik agrees with his opinion, although it is estimated that the election rules, defined by the statute, accommodate Pelta more than other candidates.
"I'd like the election to take place as by-laws as far as possible."
"I want to avoid all sorts of representational stupidity, as at the previous general meeting," says Victoria's owner Plzen, who is for the first time a candidate; and in his remarks, he was largely in conflict with Pelte.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He trusted that the new president would be known in Nimburk; he also hoped that the candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"All emotional fermentation will calm down after today's expected national team appearance in the European Championships".
"Football will be on the happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate," says the representative of Jablonez, who has the most experience in the football office, both professionally and regionally, of the three candidates.
Reichl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very mixed."
"This is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules."
"It could cause another breakdown of the general meeting".
"I hope common sense wins," said Reichl.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, separate talks took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
The extra flight that was to be delivered, among others, to Vice Presidents Dalibor Kucher and Reichl to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure.
After all, the ministerial-level meeting expected on Wednesday could be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobes, would like the opposition parties to reach an agreement as part of the strongest sports association in the country.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; football creditworthiness; and the planned ČSTV general meeting with a new Czech sports director after Sazki's financial problems.
Patzlik joins the presidential struggle because he doesn't see the right candidate.
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of footballers, Plzena Tomáš Pazlik, would see a strong candidate who met all his requirements for the president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not even claim a high office.
"If there was a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not be involved in the fight myself."
"But no such person has yet been found," said Patzlik ČTK.
Patzlik's motive to fight Miroslav Pelta and Jinderzhich Reichl is to try to prevent Pelte, the alleged electoral favorite, from entering FAČR.
Moreover, Patslik emphasizes that if he wins, he will remain president only until 2013, when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be filled by an experienced top manager not too tied to football life.
"I've talked to a few people I might have thought of."
"It was horrible for me to hear some of them say they don't even want to be involved in Czech football at the moment."
"I'd like to change that mind," he said.
At present, Patslik's main disagreement with Pelta relates to the latter's relationship with Roman Burbre, president of the regional football association in Plzena, Berbre, a man of controversial reputation who is known backstage as an influential lobbyist who can influence the voices of delegates to the general assembly.
Patzlik thus finds it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and football will not move forward".
"With Burbra's support, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful to football," said Pazlik.
He hints at the fact that Pelta's name was recorded a few years ago during a phone tap in a corruption investigation; Pelte managed to avoid conviction.
"I don't know what the prestige of Pelta's victory would have brought football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Patzlik, who now does not mention his earlier statement that he "will sell the club Plzena if Pelta becomes president."
If Patzlik wins on Thursday, he could imagine cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Pazlik supported before the September general assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I would turn to."
'He's very capable.'
"I can introduce him to the head of the team."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't know what I don't know, either," said Patslik, who drew a lot of attention to himself in September, when he supported the removal of a judge's brigade led by Ludek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Patzlik claims he'll risk running the association.
He refers to his experience in managing private companies; since last summer, he has run the Plzen team, which with his help celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its changes for the better."
"To limit the influence of certain groups of persons who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals board, leading to heinous situations," said Pazlik. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to Sparta's director Daniel Krjetinsky.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he will lobby at the highest political level for more money for sports from lottery fees.
"This is one of the key points that the new president should address."
"If taxes are imposed on gambling, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money will go," he said.
Patzlik does not consider his association with Plzeen a burden, although he claims that the president of FAČR should be independent.
Pelta is connected to the Jablonian, and Reichl to the Prague Docla.
"It's not a perfect option."
"And yet I see no point in hypocritically handing over my shares of Plzen's club to someone else if I'm going back there in six months," says Pazlik.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules that would avoid Chosen Pat.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for new FAČR rules to avoid future election rules disputes.
Before the talks on Thursday in Nimburka, Jabloneza's incumbent remains optimistic and believes that attention from the campaign will greatly distract today's anticipated success of our football team.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and funding.
He decided to take part in the election at the last minute before the last general meeting; a two-month delay could thus be useful for him to defend his idea of football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have long been in football, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday".
"They feel it's time for someone to lead the association," claims a man mainly associated with the club Jablontz; but he spent many years in Sparte and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to believe that he is experienced enough to run Czech football.
He believes that the present problems are due to the euphoria that prevailed during Ivan Gasek's reign.
"Unfortunately, rules that weren't as perfect as we all thought were adopted at a general meeting in June."
"If different means of representation had not been accepted, we would have had a president since September," Pelta said.
He viewed the rewriting of a key civil association document as a false target for delegates.
"If I become president, I'll consider it my personal task, and I'm going to take personal responsibility if this attempt turns out to be a failure."
"This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist," Pelt argues.
Besides, he says he's not trying to separate himself from his rivals.
In the past, he had already stated that he could present his cooperation with Jinderzhich Reichl, whom he valued for his legal education; he was fully aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first Vice President.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Patzlik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
"He's been in football for over a year and has achieved some success".
"In any case, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by his campaign methods."
"And that's why some of them are now questioning his true identity," Pelt said about his competitor, Pelta himself claims to be faithful to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his primary weapon of football knowledge, from competition at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team must represent all football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemian affair or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
"One day after that, I would focus on negotiating with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football," a forty-six-year-old candidate said ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the football head would not result in the dismissal of staff.
"I'll need to know the job instructions of individual employees." It was his message to Fear, where a long period of power interlocution causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the current disastrous scenarios accompanying the planned general assembly, he trusted that delegates would come to Nimburk on Thursday for good reason.
"If the only controversial question is how to hold a third-round election, we can handle it."
"Football needs the trust he can only gain by finally electing his leader," says Pelt, who two days before the key day of his career as a functioner remains an optimist.
Reichl promises that under his leadership FAČR will become active
If, at a meeting on Thursday, Jinderzhich Reichl, the acting vice president, becomes president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association will be rumored to be dissatisfied.
Ryhl promises that if he is elected, it will be a time of hard work.
He wants to set up changes in the system and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual areas in football.
He also promises to solve the problem of the Bohemians; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; attract more money to football; and continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Gasek.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national team, professional football and youth football events".
"This I don't mean to say I'll do it myself," said Reichl in my interview for ČTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to divide powers in the executive committee so that every member focuses on a specific area."
"I will carefully assign tasks so that in each of these segments football will take great steps forward".
"It probably won't please many people because it would mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly led him to doubt his candidacy.
"Only I know I work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know if it makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put sticks in my wheels and question my every move," he explained his doubts.
"However, a lot of people told me I shouldn't give up, or others will come."
"It's a trust I can't throw away," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to cross it all."
"There were trials that could produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, was elected, the situation in the Association could return to the one before Gashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's something that Mirek Pelt is hardly competent for."
"He is surrounded by people who would do football in such a way that it is accessible only to the chosen."
"I can be accused of a lot of things, but certainly not of subjectivity."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone because then everyone will have a good time, not just the minority chosen," said Reichl.
Moreover, he refutes the accusations that he will only be president of the Czech Republic.
"Although a lot of people try to argue otherwise, I plan to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league".
"It will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Reichl.
While club manager Plzen Tomás Pazlik has entered the presidential struggle, Reichl does not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success," said Reichl. To his success, he refers to the saving of tens of millions of krone on unprofitable contracts, the negotiation of contracts with television, and the negotiation of the lottery law.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was "excepted from the process of returning creditworthiness to Czech football", he considers another rival, Patslik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt he did a great job in Plzen this year".
"If he is elected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gaschek started, without significant personnel changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his benefit," said Reichl about his rival.

Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest: Travelers can test Europe's incredible water - and relax a tired body in a hot tub after a tour of the city or a walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder could not afford during his research trips for the last year and a half: without his bathing suit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up to taste-shaped domes, swam to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and gazed at carefully restored ar-auto-style swimming pools.
She rushed to add every liked pool to her notebook, with important details about the building's construction and history.
Meder's architecture historian examined more than 200 swimming pools - and has now collected impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden (The Joys of Swimming), where everything went, from public pools in Munich to historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and "functional concrete buildings" in Townus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited the baths in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but it's different in the water.
The only disadvantage is that swim fans should tolerate blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the tempting smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyous chiricating of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools should always be so awful," says Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Splashing in the pool and exquisite oils in the sauna is a health factor in the swimsuits that is so important because Meder believes that all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes if builders take on this kind of labor. "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have the surface of the water."
"The surface is very transparent but also reflects the beauty of the whole building".
All visually reflects: high ceilings, color tiles, and trams.
An illustrated edition of Swimming Pleasures in 190 pages provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of the oasis of health - and makes you want to jump into water.
Meder, a collector of water bodies, found several outstanding copies during a study in Hungary.
She found nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (The Cave Bath in Miskoltz-Tapolc) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a building built in the shape of a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jasberen), as well as gorgeous therapeutic baths such as 100-year-old Secheni baths in Budapest.
From many heated open pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is an amazing view. You can see all of Zurich from the roof bath or see snowy Arlberg from the open pool in St. Anthony, and there's a window in the steamroom that allows you to see what's happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits the swimsuits in Langenfeld, the Aqua Cathedral in Eztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In winter, he lifts steam out of three open shells, which seem very small in the background of the Eztal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
The Meder basin collector didn't smell chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell like gray, Arpad's costumes in Bekeshchaba smell so much oil, you might find it hard to believe you're in a health source.
The smell causes hydrocarbonates in alkaline water, and the water is almost black from the silt, which sticks to the skin as soon as you sink into the pool - a health experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at some point in her search for beautiful bathing places, and when she tried to visit the open basin of the Czech baths in Lugačowitz, she discovered that the area was sealed.
The kitchens designed by architect Dusan Jurkovic in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked into the sights of the red-white-yellow-style red-white building, she saw weeds growing between tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks is an amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald, the Palace of Heatwaters in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already passed through three stages of construction. You will find not only neo-Roman elements of the period since the construction of 1844, but also an Alhambra-style Mauritanian hall added around 1900.
After a thorough renovation in 1995, the Thermal Palace - the favorite swimming pool of Iris Meder basin scholar - and not just because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"This is a real achievement - so masterful to combine such different architectural styles," says Meder.
To dive into a thermal pool in such a palace is clearly a secondary activity.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank is investigating agricultural trade.
Christian Tivs
Will Deutsche stop the Bank from trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Akkermann gave the working group the task of investigating the effects of speculation on the world's poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg -
For German citizens, the situation is clear: according to one study, 84 per cent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems faced by the world's poorest people.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of Foodwatch Consumers.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Garald Schuman, demonstrates that gambling on world commodity exchanges raises prices - and banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign directly targets the head of Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade the same.
Originally, commodity rates were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that players have abandoned supply and demand rules - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann responded to criticism, promising to investigate charges and stating that no trade "is worth risking Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results are presented to the board of directors of Deutsche Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes that follow the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may be reduced or completely halted.
Akkermann's working on his image.
Foodwatch President Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, emphasizing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "The production of rising food prices is a blatant example of how thoughtless banks are now acting against common interests."
As the bank's chief lobbyist, Akkermann has a certain obligation, according to Bode.
"Deutche Bank must remove from portfolio all investments that make money bets on food prices," said Bode.
"It doesn't matter if it's hungry people or Deutsche Bank's reputation."
Akkermann's quick reaction is surprising at first, but the director would like to have an impeccable image just a few months before the end of his stay in the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not move to the review board as planned.
The elimination of controversial speculation on the food market could improve its image.
He also has little or no need to take care of the costs - the consequences will have to be dealt with by his successor.
One in two would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch tries to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, over 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday, and the study was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
No more than 11 per cent believe that investments that bet on food prices are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they discovered that their bank was involved in such a trade; according to a study, one in two would withdraw deposits that ultimately led to commodity speculation.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they'd think about closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st Century House in Vienna
The pavilion is in a new place.
Ingeborg Vincewski
Architectural history with ups, downs and happy endings: Austria's pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and was abandoned.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition center.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Carl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, which boldly expressed faith in technological progress.
Schwanzera Pavilion won the Grand Prix on Architecture in 1958 for its light floating steel and glass design.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built an Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
Eventually, he was famous for the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder tower BMW and her sister, a bowl-shaped building.
The pavilion, conceived as a building for temporary exhibitions, was moved to the Swiss Garden near the Southern Station of Vienna, transformed and opened as the 20th-century Museum in 1962 - and is often referred to as the 20th-century House for this reason.
Anyway, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - there were no walls on which to hang works of art, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been empty since 2001, and its condition has become worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has so far renovated the pavilion, which was named the 21st century House, and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum is a branch of the Belvedere Museum, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday night - in every sense a joyous event.
Agnes Hussain-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belveder Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new venture.
Hussain-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a figure skater in youth who worked at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Modernization Museum in Salzburg, convinced politicians and keepers to continue the renovation, attracted public funds and private donations, and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was to accommodate a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Votruba foundation, a cafe and a bookstore, along with modern art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict Control & Limited Budget
Krishanitz was then the perfect candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, through the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession Josef Olbrich, and won the contest, but he also studied from Schwanzer at the University of Technology Vienna, and the pavilion was for him "a particularly important place" where he attended exhibitions "almost every week."
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that stood in front of the building, a building that had already lost part of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems with the last restructuring were much more serious, the building was an energy sink, says Krishanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, the glass reinforced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced by a high-end safe glass.
Steel crossovers of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
Two lower floors created space for the new use of the building, a fallen light well between the building and the street provides lighting - a virtually new building but still a fine Schwanzer Pavilion.
Original exterior doors were retained, and the building was painted into an old red-brown color of corrosion protection.
The theater hall is the same as it used to be.
These are all subject to strict control by the museum office and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and approved by the museum office," says Krishanitz, pointing to the uneven floor in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light despite limitations, problems, and transformation.
Krishanitz recently noticed that the Brussels pavilion was a rough, typical story of "crawling in the city."
This architecture is "always out of place" and still wants to "encourage real awareness."
The 21st century house is in a very right place, because in planning the city, there was unexpected luck, and a completely reconstructed "head station quarter" with offices and residential properties is growing around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may occur. The 21st century house may be supplemented by the second Krishanitz building, collector Francesca von Habsburg, has acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city about its location next door in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multimillion-dollar winter crisis package
Deutsche Bahn announced a crisis plan to avoid cancellations of trains in the winter.
The number of staff should double.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn's internal crisis plan, Bild reports that investments totalling about 300 million euros are planned until 2015.
Investments are intended to improve the productivity of locomotives and rail networks, even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of in-house and contracted staff involved in snow cleaning from tracks and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice before they start operation and 90 per cent of the required shooters within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancellations and late trains this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties with passenger transport as it lacked reserves at a time of deteriorating weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting years for approval by the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the axes of ICE trains much more often for many years after one of the ICE trains had a broken axle at the main station in Cologne.
Deutsche Bank will pay a lot of millions of pounds of fines in the United States.
New troubles came after excitement around Josef Ackermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is facing a US fine of many millions of pounds sterling.
It's like Deutsche Bank didn't have much trouble in his home country, the past of an industrial giant in the United States has now overtaken him. Deutsche Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (€106 million) to calm the controversy that arose after bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The bond value fell sharply during the financial crisis and pulled credit unions down.
"We are glad to have solved this problem without the parties going to court," said the representative of Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank did not plead guilty in the agreement.
The same is true for Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA president Debbie Matz welcomed the prompt reaction of both banks.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA), is responsible for US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA struggles to compensate for losses that result from billions.
This is the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and filed a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a mortgage pool.
They're backed up by domestic loans.
This decided the fate of a number of financial companies when a bubble in the real estate market in the United States burst in 2007.
The American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 at the crest of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a large number of claims seeking compensation or punishment of fraudsters.
Behind the largest wave of claims is the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).
It accuses 18 major international banks of having purchased about $200 billion in collateral agreements from American credit organizations, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank is also facing a threat of prosecution by the FHFA over numerous agreements with a total value of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires a bank headquartered in Frankfurt to assume responsibility for “significant losses” but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests 10 billion in IBM.
Buffet's financial guru is actively investing in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares totalling over $10 billion.
So far, the largest American investor, Warren Buffett, has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the IBM annual report changed his view of investment in the industry.
According to Buffett, he had to realize much earlier that IBM primarily offered services and bought computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffet's investment was seen as a knightly act.
IBM, a veteran of IT Industry, now has the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the American business television channel CNBC, Buffett reported that he had purchased IBM shares totalling $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding of Burkeshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM stockholders with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even IBM until recently knew nothing about his involvement.
He praised the management that had managed to gain even during the financial crisis.
"They did a lot of work," Buffett said, referring to the management strategy.
For a considerable time, IBM focused on high-income IT services such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, now over 100 years old, also offers software and advisory services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided technology companies.
He claimed he only invests in those companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, lubricants and engineering.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns shares in a long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
An 81-year-old acquired a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s and built one of the world's most expensive companies based on it with skilled investment.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
Making him a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable instinct to make money brought him the nickname "Omaha Oracle."
IBM's equity price rose by one percent before opening markets after Buffet's investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as the IBM is also called, is worth over $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the world's most expensive high-tech companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is his close friend.
Imminent danger
After the discovery of the "cell in Tswickau", Turkish media began to question the power of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers is talking about a "bloody ideology" that is now rising to the surface again.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a reaction to the report in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has given rise to long-forgotten fears; there have been no such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks since the fires in Melna in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There was never any doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network now discovered is of such magnitude that it is not yet fully aware.
"Renaissance of a Blood Ideology?" was the headline of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk's Internet version.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant for secret services, and expresses concern that German authorities may be drawn into the right-wing extreme swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, remembering victims of racial hatred with a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral labour agreement at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries has been presented in a positive light as a success story.
The coverage in some Turkish media was a slap. "German fiftieth anniversary gift" is the title of an article on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriyet also did not miss an opportunity to draw this parallel.
"It starts to smell bad" is the name of Ahmet Kulahji's column.
He notes that people who paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany were killed.
Police conduct and subsequent successful raids were strongly criticized on German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not considered following suspicious persons in right-wing extremist circles before.
Some authors have come to a rather sharp level of rhetoric. "If they continue to act as clumsyly, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves in armed self-defence."
"It'll be the best self-defense."
"Peace in Germany depends very much on how the entire network is opened and on the legality of punishment," writes Selen.
The crimes in Melln and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example that peace in Germany was threatened.
The photo of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply captured in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks so clearly living here that they are in danger and the Germans that mistrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity among the Turks.
Do not repeat past mistakes
The Turkish press at the time condemned mainly the failure of the German police after the attacks, and Helmut Kohl refused to visit survivors in Melne.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the arsons in Zolingen, but his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel took part in a memorial ceremony in Cologne in his speech calculating the taxes that Turks pay in Germany,
It's like he defined the value of a man with the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in Turkish media has again shown how the mistrust of many German Turks towards the current German state has deepened since then.
Clearly showing what needs to be done now, in addition to efforts to identify and reassess right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal at Zurich Lake
Most of Europe’s leading risk-taking banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been continuously struggling with one or the other crisis ever since.
Now the German must return him to the right course.
Alex Webber probably didn't know he was gonna get that part.
In July, following his spectacular departure as head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would begin working in an equally spectacular position, the chairman of the board of directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Weber was clearly thrilled, praised Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its newly acquired strength, and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS managed to change for the better".
"I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel".
But it became clear in September that things would be very different.
The UBS trader in London bypassed the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The UBS Executive Director, Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the UBS board of directors has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know: When will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber is due to consult the bank from February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he's going to chair the board in May, not 2013.
It won't be easy for Alex Webber.
He's a professor of economics and a specialist of the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he'll definitely need time to adapt.
He suddenly turned out to be responsible for the bank's strategy, which proved once again that he had long earned the title of "the biggest banking scandal in Europe."
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - until recently he managed the largest assets in the world - and, on the other hand, has not emerged from scandals for years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank spares nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Up until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The bank combined the image of a hidden and stable but deft asset manager with ambitious goals and the desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007 UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus having more money in management from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world,
And as an investment bank, he joined the league of the world's largest banks.
It was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and bank professor who has long taught at the University of Zurich Institute of Banking, explains, "I've always cited my UBS students as a good bank model."
"Knowing what we know now, you can ask how I could be so wrong."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was going completely wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, Executive Director Peter Wuffley - who was considered a distinguished intellectual and equally brilliant banker - suddenly retired from his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The bank's investment unit attempted to play on subprime securities and had to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to confront the crisis.
The Bank has indeed been able to find investors – but investors whose services many bankers would have politely abandoned recently – one very opaque Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund so hidden that its name has not even been disclosed.
It was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, and the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, the second-highest-wage chairman of the board of directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
A disaster struck in October 2008 and, owing to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was threatened with collapse and the state had to save it.
The National Bank purchased toxic securities from UBS for an unnamed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a mandatory conversion to become a bank's co-owner.
All of Switzerland was shocked: the country realized the dramatic consequences of the fact that huge banks had settled in a small country.
After all, the total UBS balance in 2007 was five times that of all Swiss production (see graph).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the United States and stated that he was ready to transfer data to wealthy customers who might have been tax-exempted with the help of a bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million consisting of reimbursement of unjustified business income plus fines.
UBS thus admitted more or less that it was a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in fighting for wealthy customers, a veil of secrecy.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors then resigned, and
The outflow of clients' money has begun.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both its main areas of activity, investment due to poor speculation and asset management as a result of aid and encouragement of tax evasion.
And it just calmed down, and it seemed like UBS was able to reverse the situation, as it happened to a trader con artist, and one single trader let down 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
One thing is clear: risk management in the investment office is not yet working.
"Adopoli incident has made it clear that risk control has not changed enough," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Banking Institute of Zurich University.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks, too, has no doubt: "UBS's problem is that it does not have a risk-control tool."
It was caution that for a long time made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world's largest assets — not an unnecessary risk, but security for money, whether or not the world fell apart from the Alpine Republic.
Swiss bank safes have become a symbol of permanent reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize sophisticated taste in chocolate.
UBS headquarters in Zurich still corresponded to the image of a decent Swiss private bank, but it was slightly larger.
Her location is classic.
The bank's head office is located in Zurich on Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to Zurich Lake, surrounded by snow caps of Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxury, and the rental rates for shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops like Confiserie Sprüngli, jewelry firms such as Tiffany's can be found here.
Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Credi Suisse Palace and elite private banks like Julius Bair.
The heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls, there are large leather sofas next to the bank emblem of the big sign "Safe".
UBS knows what its customers need, reliability.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at one point abandoned Swiss notions of banking—or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks believes, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper - like all Swiss bankers, he's also working with two major banks.
He believes the UBS has become too big – particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxes are very active.
In his view, the Swiss have nothing to add here.
"And if there's anything, they've long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it the first large profits - and then failed - that no other European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle of sub-prime assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country, with a population of seven million people, launched the largest rescue operation in the history of the country," Lucas Hassig writes in her book The Crash of UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come to this?
If you ask Swiss banks, they'll say the problem is mostly the size of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed that was too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
This was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a rich but steppe bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money they could use to spin an almighty wheel.
Two names relate to UBS growth: Peter Wolfley, executive director of the UBS group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors.
"I always thought Wolfley and Ospel were a dream team," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulffley, outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding models and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instincts, who went all the way up, starting with an intern in a bank".
But Ospel eventually relied on Wolfley.
And Wolffley could have made a critical mistake. "He thought his models were real," Geiger says.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember well the meetings of board members at which Wolffley always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he headed the "turntable" to which the banks' successes had been made.
UBS wanted to hit the top of this table.
He was able to make part of it.
UBS was the largest player in currency trade and government securities.
The authorized management consultants, however, pointed out a weakness: according to the term “permanent income” in bank terminology, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failures in American mortgage products.
To shut the hole, UBS got into an adventure that almost cost him his life.
In pursuit of growth, the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in American subprime securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that combined securities based on American mortgages and sold them further, continuing to bear risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought until summer 2007 when the American real estate market was already on fire," says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the height, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to clean up the bank proved more difficult than it seemed at first.
UBS posts have become a children's game with chairs and remain unreliable until today.
Anyone who heads this huge bank is facing an almost impossible task.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Gaeger's bank analyst already has the idea of giving up investment banking, focusing on asset management, and forgetting his Swiss roots.
The bank, however (yet) is not ready to go that far.
Nevertheless, it is clear that investment activities need to be significantly discouraged.
The new head of the bank Sergio Hermotti plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
A 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was in fact seen only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor Grubel.
Since then, he has been able to show character and now, as the Zurich bank stated on Tuesday, he is leading UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state it was in in the mid-1990s.
It cuts 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's the UBS?
How does he plan on making money?
These questions must be asked by Axel Weber.
Publicly, he said only that he and his wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe pull down the American stock exchange
The impending recession in Europe worsened the mood of American investors early in the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome has had little effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has overshadowed hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the bud.
The general relief that followed the changes of government in Rome and Athens has not been reinforced.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half-full, not half-empty - but now the problems are back to the fore, said Mark Luskini of Janey Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on sales lists.
The Dow Jones industrial index closed at 12.078 with a decline of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer during the bidding varied between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The larger S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, falling by one percent.
Nasdaq's technology index lost 0.8 per cent, trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell 1.2 per cent, closing at 5,985 points.
Industry in 17 euro zone countries has significantly reduced production and is adjusting to the end of growth.
The Eurostat Statistical Service reported that companies produced two per cent less in September than in the previous month.
This message turned American investors into skeptics. "We're not on an island, we depend on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe was unlikely to shake the recession quickly and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these concerns, and in an interview with CNBC, he said it was not clear whether Europe was strong enough to do whatever it took to end the crisis.
Therefore, in his view, it was too early to invest in European public bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffet threw a decade-long principle into the trash bin and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM, worth over ten billion dollars, raised the value of this oldest company's shares in the trade by almost one percent against the trend.
The shares closed, almost unchanged, at $187.35.
Buffett stated that he paid an average of $170 per share and now has a 5.5 per cent stake.
The share price of his investment company, Berkshire Hathway, fell by 1.3 per cent.
Bank of America shares fell by 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted into cash almost all of its remaining share of the Construction Bank of China, generating $6.6 billion.
The Bank mainly plans to support its capital quota with net profits from sales in order to meet stricter standards.
Boeing aircraft manufacturer won, reducing losses on Dow-Jones.
The stock price rose 1.5 percent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.

Including an option to buy another 20 planes, the total is actually $26 billion.
About 710 million shares changed ownership on the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares of 719 companies grew, 2,281 fell and 79 remained at the same level.
The shares of 630 companies completed the bidding with growth, 1913 fell, and 82 remained at the same level at Nasdaq with a turnover of 1.38 billion shares.
Smart crows fill cities
Gracis are considered problematic birds in many places, and experts today say that these very intelligent birds will no longer be able to be driven out of cities.
Some love birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but residents complaining about mud and noise are growing in many localities.
The solution to the problem of birds, however, is far from being achieved.
At the first raven symposium in Lehr, East Frisia, experts argued that the rook could no longer be driven out of the cities.
Experts from across Germany discussed possible solutions.
Searching for alternatives in cities
Conservatives argued that the root of the problem in cities was in the migration of specially protected rooks, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture had increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction and cutting out traditional tree nesting made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under guard.
There are large colonies in the town of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwest in Yever, Deepholz, Ahim under Bremen and Lere, with more than 600 parent pairs.
The controversial project to shoot off crows in Lere caused disapproval of newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described trapping birds and slaughtering them with sticks as a particular cruelty.
"Regular displacement and intimidation don't bring anything," said architect and landscape designer Werner Clever of Lere.
Collapsed nests with water or felling trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals dissipate, and large colonies divide and spread to other areas".
Intimidation is only possible on an exceptional basis near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We'll have to live with them, getting rid of them is not an option."
In isolation from surrounding areas, the problem in the cities will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
A combination of intimidating birds from protected residential areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be an exit.
"Info stands instead of chainsaw" was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Juergens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We have to be sure of ourselves to live with this problem."
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information stands provide information about the life of highly intelligent rooks.
The project is already attracting the interest of tourists.
Juergens also gave her opinion on complaints about bird noise. "The noise transmits a lot of information, they have a lot to say to each other."
The mind and the brilliance of these birds have entered legends, and the Gracis often not only use guns to capture the looming piece, but also make the guns themselves.
Behavior researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested a measure of a bird's mind on four grazes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that you had to knock on a plaque to get a larvae of moth.
Without special training, they recognized the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the plaque.
In another experiment, smart people had to face a more difficult task.
Researchers put a small bucket of moth in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get the beak's prey.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used the wire to make hooks and used hooks to grab the bucket by the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four rooks have managed this since the first attempt.
Ronaldo takes Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of Bosniacs and Turks to win at the last minute did not last long.
Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will compete in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took the final positions in the Euro 2012 Championships in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the leadership of superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored in 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina with a score of 6:2 (2:1), perfecting its fifth Euro exit after 0–0 in the first phase.
Cheham was enough 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of playoffs against Montenegro's outsider after a net win in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss its chance by playing 0–0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily scored 1–1 (1–0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Neder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloza (80th) scored the rest of the goals for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional player from Wolfsburg Staran Misimovich and Captain Emyr Spahić reduced the difference by two points thanks to an effective 41st minute penalty and a goal on 65th for Bosnia.
Sena Lulić received a second yellow card in the 54th minute.
Portugal has already kicked Bosnia out of the 2010 World Cup playoffs in South Africa.
Portugal made a great start on the Lisbon Ashtadiu da Luz.
Ronaldo took an early start, striking the gate freely from about 30 meters.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-range capability, with a 25-metre mark increasing to 2-0.
The Bosnians, who did not open the account in the first half an hour, were given their first opportunity thanks to their attacker, Edina Jacko.
Former Wolfsburg player from Manchester City's English championship leader sent the ball head in the lower edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the gate line in the 33rd minute.
Yiraček scores for the Czech Republic
Then Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding became the focus of attention.
Following the attack on Elder Postig in the Bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player had simulated, and showed him a yellow card.
Štark also awarded a dubious penalty for playing the hand after Fabiu Kuentran - Misimovich's foul fulfilled it.
After the 2004 break, Europe's vice champions secured the account with four more goals.
Peter Yiraček dispelled all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championships go to the European Championships for the fifth consecutive time.
Luck also smiled at Coach Michael Bileck's team and Bundesliga legionaires Michael Cadletz (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake at the outset that could be catastrophic.
Goalkeeper Peter Chech in the 9th minute, thanks to an instant reflex, prevented the potential carhead of Tomash Siwok.
Montenegro had the best chances when the duet of Stevan Yovetić and Dejan Damjanović was on the field.
Damjanović struck from the edge of the penalty area in the 40th minute and nearly scored Czecha's goal.
After a break, the boom saved the already damaged world-class goalkeeper Chech after FC Seoul left the field in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after a 0–3 loss in Istanbul, the Turks could not play better than a 0–0 draw in Zagreb.
Although there is now little doubt that coach Gus Hidedink will now vacate the team's bench that reached third place in 2002, Croats find themselves on the final round of the European Championships for the fourth time.
The Turks were almost able to launch perfectly in front of 31,000 spectators at Maximir Stadium.
Seljuk Inan's far blow in the seventh minute hit the counter, and Kazim Kazim's attacker failed to kick the ball off the grid.
Croatia then woke up and increasingly seized control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent shape.
The Bundesliga Legionaires Daniel Pranić (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Mandjukić of the Wolfsburg team, who gave way to Ivan Perišić of Dortmund in the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is going to Euro-2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first appearance on the Euro after Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team—who already looked confident in her place after a 4–0 victory in the first stage—has taken the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to Stephen Ward's goal.
Constantine Vasiliev of the guest team equalled the score in the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good pace from the start, but only in the 23rd minute, Robbie Keen of Los Angeles struck the first clean head.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from bringing Ireland forward.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
After bypassing the defense of the goalkeeper Paul Londak, Ward found himself in the right place and, after releasing the ball across the line, changed the score by 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double the number of its workers in China in the next few years.
The Dax listing company reported on Thursday that it was going to invest about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) before 2015.
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and hire thousands of people," said Bill McDermott, one of the executive directors of SAP, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
The state of 2,500 should grow to 4,500.
The leader of the world industrial software market plans to double the number of its offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
This boom country hosts about 4,000 SAP clients out of over 176,000 worldwide.
China's growth count is an important component of this Dax listing company's 2015 strategy.

SAP has been in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to change the scale of our operations," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to achieve sustained growth based on informationalization in China".
Massacres are a human dimension.
Peter Englund's busy and very kind new book, Beauty and Grief: The Personal History of World War I, begins with a long list of actors from which the heart dies.
Here's the advice to read next: carefully cut out this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very closely as Mr. Englund's story goes, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon, at times when, like one of these men and women, you'll get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as "work on anti-historical history."
It has few known names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, cunning journalists, or discussions on tactics and military equipment.
It's not so much a book about what was, he explains, as a book about what it was like, it's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and state of the spirit."
The book Beauty and Grievance combined the experiences of the military years of 20 more or less insignificant men and women, from both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone gets captured, loses a hand or a leg, goes crazy or dies.
Their lives are glimmering here like church candles: new ones are added to a multitude of others, and some are extinguished at this time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is an amendment to the notion that World War I was only a severe trenches war on the Western Front.
Beauty and Grief ably provides a panoramic of other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are hit by bee hives; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the unresolved problem is tsetse flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling like smokeless powder.
When a canonade is heard and you're a woman and you're at home with the children, will you stay where you are or will you run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on or why we have to fight this war.
"The lack of facts," Mr. Englund notes, "replete with speculations, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
Beauty and sorrow tracks the fate of people like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are taken mainly from memoirs, letters and other materials already published.
Stories about their lives may be scary or exciting, but they are highly alive due to the small moments and fragmentary details collected by Mr. Englund.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with it.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzac, everywhere is Erzac."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons".
He continues to talk about erzatz food in Germany.
He describes "a meat of pressed rice welded in lamb fat (and decorated with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato skin; shoes hit by a tree".
He notes that there were “837 registered substitutes for meat permitted in sausage production, 511 registered substitutes for coffee”.
Some stories tell of honour and courage.
One American notes in himself the desire for cruelty and says of war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men were created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a bestseller, and to claim that this display is civilization and under your decorated cufflinked shirt there is no barbarian."
On the contrary, the British soldier observes that he is likely to die and no one will notice or grieve.
"When a person comes to terms with the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think it would happen in front of the public," he writes.
But on the contrary, it's like a "sentenced man hanged in secret."
Other comments concern old Europe, which is falling apart, and new forms of fear.
"Conflict became an increasingly economic competition," Mr. Englund writes, "war factories."
He notices the coming of someone he calls "a new species in the bestaries of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-sewn suit that arranges a massacre sitting at a written table."
People act in an unanticipated way: low-level acts are as much heroic as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke of soldiers who tried their best to catch sexually transmitted diseases from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the gonore pus trade that the soldiers bought and smeared their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital," he writes.
"All the desperate rubbed him in the eye, which often led to lifelong blindness".
Translated with Swedish Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is flexible, but unscrupulous, well suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how war "frees completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, such as Paul Fassel's Great War and Modern Memory or novels such as Erich-Marie Remark's Western Front Without Change, rather than exhaustive historical writings.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this uncharted pantheon.
His book has the most amazing finale I can remember in non-art literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he reached out of the book to a page with a list of characters, grabbed it out of your hands and set it on fire with a match.
After the previous mistake - a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some wearing protective helmets.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because Zucotti Park at that time should have been the least of the people.
The operation kept a secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, the others were told at first that they were going to the exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the events, his presence stressed how much importance the Police Department attached to the operation.
There could be no repetition of episodes of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which was contrary to departmental rules and caused a storm of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation began to release protesters from Zucotti Park.
The authorities were preparing to watch the occupation unfold in other cities.
The largest crisis drills were conducted on Randalls Island with a view to Zucotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot trainings - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - with reference to Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the last minute, a source familiar with orders that mentioned the task only as "training."
"The few cops I know who have been called to this case haven't been told they're being sent to Zucotti Park," said this man, who spoke anonymously.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zucotti Park were at the highest posts in the department".
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson the city learned.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated in front of hundreds of protesters who snuck inside before the scheduled deadline, hearing about these plans.
Members of various police units participated in the operation on Tuesday, including forces from the districts - police teams, which were usually used to control the criminal surrounding areas.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, come and leave the park during the day, making 1:00 a.m. the appropriate time for an advance.
"It was right to do it when the park had the least people," he said.
Rescue service cars with searchlights and loudspeakers, gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The searchlight and the pre-recorded announcements, which are made out of loudspeakers, seem to have intimidated many protesters.
When administrative officers in their blue windbreakers entered the park, many protesters simply packed their belongings and left.
Police reported that the tents did not touch until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack their things.
Other groups of police officers, as witnessed by eyewitnesses, gathered around the perimeter to enter if arrests were required in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a spokesman for the head of the Police Department, said it was for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police operate and that they were treated harshly by the police.
Mr Brown said that cars with television cameras on Church Street, along the western boundary of the park, could take pictures.
When the police went west through a pile of personal belongings of protesters, including bags, plastic mats and polyethylene bags, full of clothes, the Department of Sanitation teams followed it, collecting what had been thrown.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged out, and photographs of this soon appeared on the Internet.
A major group of protesters took up positions near the kitchen of the camp, near the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police went inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp chained themselves together.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Rescue services were called in to cut down the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until around 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The clean-up operation was completed in about 75 minutes, and police reported.
Mr Brown said that some 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of them were arrested for "violating public order and resisting detention," he said.
The highest-ranking officer in the field was Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department's detective police force, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “did not direct the operation”, said Mr. Brown.
A second group of police officers were waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to enter.
The barriers were erected on Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
Observers saw police expand the perimeter from these positions even further beyond the Zucotti Park borders.
At one point, observers saw a group of policemen, many with shields, crowding people even further out.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, released air from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one protestor were hospitalized.
The school service staff union will sue the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students study.
The trial is probably the last remedy available to the District Council's 37 trade union trying to cancel the dismissal.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinator and other employees who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city lost their seats on 7 October as a result of what union leaders described as a political response to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds managed by workers' groups to close a hole in the budget last spring.
City officials categorically rejected this accusation.
At the City Council hearings last month, school Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the board members argued, telling him that there was no indication in the budget that school support staff would be dismissed.
Representatives of the 37 district council reported that they had filed a complaint, warning the Department of Education that a lawsuit had been filed against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to declare a formal suit before the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will identify Mr. Walcott and the City's Department of Education as defendants and list eight temporarily dismissed employees as plaintiffs, all black or Latin American women, like most of the assistants who lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint held by the New York Times, the union focused on a number of school layoffs in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no dismissals on Staten Island and there were few dismissals in Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school support staff lost seats in district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave for Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants working at the free secondary school 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: "These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to make up for budget failures."
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and she also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate additional funding for every poor student who goes to school.
The trade union also claims that school directors could have been misled by the language of the notice allowing for the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The notice used the word “exceedance”, although “exceedance” is more commonly referred to when a teacher from the school's payroll moves to a list of existing employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were dismissed," says the draft of the lawsuit, "not just translated."
Mission over, Congress ready for Libya agreement
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree to something related to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the mutiny to succeed, the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is to consider a resolution put forward by Chairman John Kerry (Democratic, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), who praises Libyans for a successful rebellion and American troops for "the bravery".
"The point of this resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"This is confirmation of the support of both parties for their democratic aspirations".
Language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has been easy.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and the White House about the language of a series of resolutions endorsing or condemning the role of the American army in NATO's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution allowing limited use of American military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority vote of both parties and never reached the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut funding for the American operation in Libya.
This left the American mission in some sort of legislative purgatory - when Congress is annoyed enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so angry as to really tear the soil out of her feet.
Then the events surpassed Congress's indecision.
Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially concluded on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready to act.
The resolution of the Foreign Affairs Committee “rewards the Libyan people for their incredible bravery and extraordinary endurance in pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism”.
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will the new measures receive the full support of the Foreign Affairs Council or break up legislators like the June bill?
The last version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, Republican leader on the Committee.
Luger's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives this week should vote for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by House Member Bob Goodlatt (Republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else to be put to a plenary vote by the Congress of that convocation.
Other legislators have not yet been able to bring their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Goodlatt Amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments addressing a wide range of issues that have been introduced in this convocation.
Some duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate - others were minor variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the House of Representatives and some more about “control over federal spending”.
Some of them are identical, but give their authors - mostly newly elected Republicans who wish to decorate their résumés - the opportunity to brag that they have “suggested” such a proposal.
The budget control act, which took place in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote for a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some Congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office for members of Congress, and House member José Serrano (Democratic, New York) wants to abolish the two-term limit for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) has proposed numerous amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as has another one prohibiting the burning of a flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two thirds of the states object to them.
As members of Congress have sought to propose amendments, they have not moved faster than in past years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments, while in the 110th Congress they introduced 66.
This pace is declining compared to the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were no more successful than they are now.
The last amendment that was adopted, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but it was actually introduced into Congress in 1789.
"Battered but not defeated," Giffords says in her first television interview after the assassination attempt.
Ten months after an armed man shot at her at a public event in Tucson, member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on a federal channel Monday night, sang a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Tomorrow" and said that she wanted more to recover than to return to Congress.
Upon appearing on the 20/20 ABC News program with Diane Sawyer, Giffords had difficulty formulating proposals and needed help walking.
The program showed her difficult way to recover from an injury caused by a bullet that crushed the skull and pierced the left side of the brain, going from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the Bill of Exclusive Duty.
In her first television interview after a January shooting in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "hard".
When Sawyer asked how she was feeling, Giffords, 41, said, "Very good."
An interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a 20/20 hour special issue that was shown the eve of the release of the new book of the spouses, Gabby: A History of Courage and Hope.
The special described Giffords' reconstruction after the January 8 shooting.
On a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at her husband's request.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physical therapists teach her how to do simple things.
Nod your head.
Pull out the lips.
And then her first word was, "What."
A few days later, Giffords uttered the second word, "toast," a request to change the menu of breakfast.
The video shown by ABC shows that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: we see a congressman singing along with "Girls just want to party" doctors Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she didn't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband told me that he was reading Giffords an article in the paper about the shooting on March 12, when she stopped him to ask him for the first time about the six who were killed then.
Suspected assailant Jerd Lee Lafner is held in Missouri prison and is subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"Many people died," Giffords Sawyer said.
"It's heavy, it's hard, it's hard."
One day during her recovery, he said to Kelly Sawyer, she said, "I'm defeated."
"And I said, "Habby, you're not defeated," said Kelly.
You're just beaten up.
And you're gonna get through this, you're gonna get better, and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street holiday that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
On the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines lined up around him.
The audience in the tuxedo applauded him standing up.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, which also included the then Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were treated like orphans," wrote an officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
Quite the opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has developed between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired, American public.
The troops waste praise for their sacrifices.
But praises have a price, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting like it feels sorry for people in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and soon leaves for Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us like unhappy."
It's a sensitive subject for warlords who don't want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger experienced by returning troops in the recent years of the Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most talk of pity takes place quietly and only between combat veterans.
After two of his sons returned from combat as part of the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Canning warned them that men from outside the army would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration, because they rake the rebels and have been in exotic places.
Others will wonder whether "under the mask of a violent, evil veteran," says Canyon, who fought in Iraq and returned to hold a high government office in Washington.
While looking for a job, he says, he felt that some interviewers were careful to ask if he would be able to withstand the strain of responsible work in Washington immediately after the battle trip.
Canyon recalls how he told his sons, "When you tell about your service, you have to count on a negative effect."
The awkwardness experienced by the military comes in part from American indifference to wars.
Winning on the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was quite common in World War II," says retired Lieutenant General David Barnow, who commanded American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mostly focused on the depth of the soldier's suffering.
Troops estimate by the number of trips they have made, by the number of comrades they have lost, or by the scale of the losses.
The army faces increasing pressure from anti-rape advocates
This week, the historic court hearing must decide whether 28 men and women against the army will be admitted on charges of non-adversarial rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the next one.
Private first-class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and, in her 11th week of pregnancy, she was allegedly raped by her co-worker at night.
This was in October 2008, she was returning to her barracks at Miramar airfield, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend and met a male co-worker carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," Lyman says.
But the native of Texas took care of her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instincts back then."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man came up behind her, kicked her and raped her, she claims.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and another 27 current and former military personnel will wait intensely for the judgment of the trial at the historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have brought against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rasmfeld will go to court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld were unable to deal with widespread violence in the army, in violation of the soldiers' constitutional rights.
The lawsuit filed in February by lawyer Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., initially included 17 plaintiffs, but increased to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, who all claimed that they had been raped or threatened with sexual violence by their co-workers and that the army had not properly investigated, prosecuted or brought to justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting top army officials because the problem starts with them.
"Army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can eliminate the cult of violence?
Burke also says that since February, she has been contacted by some 400 other victims, many of whom may take part in future claims.
Her strategy: instead of collecting all the plaintiffs in this case - putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak - she will open a lot of cases if necessary to maintain pressure.
The Ministry of Defence defense team, led by Federal Attorney Neil McBride, took steps to end the case.
The judicial documents that Newsweek has received reveal a protection strategy, mainly that former or current soldiers cannot claim by the army for damage suffered in the armed forces.
Under the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court judgement by Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for damage caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the inherent risk inherent in the military service of the claimants”, the documents state.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially prohibited from fighting, this separation exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contacting local women in the war zone.
Result: 150 female soldiers died between the two wars, two thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the armies to become modern, too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her lawsuit, three others are prepared.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar prepares a case against the four largest military academies on charges of promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
A separate non-profit association of American war veterans in Viet Nam is preparing a lawsuit against the army, which focuses on the diagnosis of “personal change” that is given to victims of violence to suspend them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Ana Bhagwati of the human rights group, Action by women soldiers.
In December, her team filed a lawsuit against the Veterans' Office, accusing him of discriminatory practices in considering applications for pensions from people who claimed to have been threatened with sexual violence during the service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were submitted to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Ministry of Trafficking ' s Sexual Violence Prevention and Control Service, 3,158 rape attempts were reported.
But, as is well known, attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this figure represents approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of the reported cases reached trial status, twice as low as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case only call attacks on them the first among other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported the rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she said, she was asked to give details of the rape separately 11 times to a line of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of rape evidence, and the attacker's blood -- from a cut on her arm -- was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before a judge at a hearing, during which she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six persons gave a positive characterization to the accused, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was about to give birth - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember my commanding officer saying, "It wasn't a trial against him, it was a trial against me."
Lyman was ordered to consult a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with personality change, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with an unfavourable wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether or not the case put forward by Lyman and her fellow plaintiffs is a difficult question, says John Terley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
He notes, however, that “I believe they are in a position to move forward”.
Between them and the verdict stands the doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared.
I've spent my whole life criticizing Doctrine Feres.
The army has fallen behind for decades because it does not have the incentives and deterrents that impose responsibility.
He adds, "Shans are very much against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will change only when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform," she says.
Or until we die, depending on what happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Brawick was an ordinary guy to articulate his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Brawick, who confessed to the Norwegian massacre in July, which claimed the lives of 77 people, appeared at his first public hearing.
Although Brawick could act alone, he was far from alone online: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, interacting with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy, you just have to go to Facebook.
"We realized it's not hard to get close to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report on European cyber-populism by the British DEMOS Research Center.
The personal data stock on Facebook is so large, Bartlett says that researchers could easily use the website's promotional tool to single out the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy - that marketers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then pitched them ads, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the ad offered the user a poll that included questions about their level of education, attitudes to violence, and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants in 14 extreme right-wing parties in 11 European countries - even without leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," Bartlett says.
Some results are less striking: right-wing online actors are more likely to be male youths dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are more intelligent, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just hide behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything in the world, from health issues to social trends, expressed in the Lights, posts on the wall and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three entries per day, Facebook's "super-actual information" causes a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the title of the site in the title by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's beauty is that it provides an opportunity to study people who cannot be approached on the street with a notebook.
"Once upon a time, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to join the party, and they would never have accepted you," Bartlett says.
"Facebook excludes all this - you address them directly".
Others say that the site could identify and investigate problems of social health.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drunken feats on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno suggests that students' peers, such as their hostel mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who too often updates drunken status.
"You cannot solve the problem without finding it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behaviour and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk who would not otherwise be found."
Facebook also continuously retrieves different kinds of data about its users.
The website's data processing team processed statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in mid-2010, and the National Happiness Index (mostly using information only available to them - cyberfreedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive data collection publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what about when Facebook users become part of a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined standards for offline research, online data are publicly available.
"I don't think many users have even thought about what a researcher can watch their profiles," says Neil Selwin, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using public Facebook pages of students.
"As far as they knew, it was just between them and their friends."
Then the question of methodology arises.
Even offline there is no guarantee that the object of the study is absolutely honest.
You can't find out on Facebook how much information in the profile and on the user page is true.
"What you're saying on Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook are two completely different things," Selvin says.
That is why, despite his years of work in technology research, Selvin thinks that the notebook and pen are still the best research tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace going out into the real world and communicating with real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social research, and most social research is still offline".
Cold and Inhuman: Anders Bering Brawick will face public trial for the first time
Anders Bering Brawick, a man who confessed to organizing a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during the first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and Knights of the Templers of Norway," he said in front of 500 present in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit actions, but I don't admit guilt."
Judge Torkyel Nesheim interrupted Brawick during this monologue because he "did not want to give Brawick the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought with him a written speech, to address the victims ' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, denied him access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Bravik in the eye, others to make sure he was kept under lock and key.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," told Norwegian NRK one of the survivors on Utoya.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally it made me feel a little better after I saw and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue Brawick tie maintained calm and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Brawick's strange idea that he was part of a big resistance movement, the judge ruled that he was not insane, and said there was no evidence that he had acted with his accomplices.
Some may be reassured that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation is now feeling.
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he didn't," said a relative of a victim.
"It'd be a lot easier if it were."
Seven lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, which is shown at the theater this week.
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans might consider the biggest discovery in a recently discovered interview, which was remembered in the run-up to the major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a thorough organizer and a modernist of the production process who believed that many business leaders suffered from "diseases to think that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a great idea from a great product separates a great amount of skillful labor."
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the television series Triumph Nerds about the arrival of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs after a unique long conversation.
By then, it had been about 10 years since Jobs had been kicked out of Apple, and he had already worked hard for his new computer company NeXT in anticipation of the massive development of the Internet.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in the Nerds, he says the originals of the interview were missing during transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This filmed material, slightly edited, was the basis for a 68-minute film, Steve Jobs: Lost interview, which is released at Landmark Theatres this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred for a detailed interview, Jobs here seems unorthodox to articulate his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different points during the interview, there are long intervals between questions and answers - reflections of 10 to 15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to be more precise.
There are also moments where Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems annoyed by Kringley's questions, forcing him to move faster to issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In the pre-Pixar era, iPods and iPhones lost interview there is something sinister prophetic when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offers their own vision of the future of information technologies.
It's one thing to read about Jobs' posthumous assessments of work, but there's something vulnerable and inspiring in Jobs that we see here, an alarming dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things might and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All the time in the business, I keep asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers you always get are, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to streamline reporting in Apple.
Disturbed by the way of recording expenditure, often beginning with "standard costs" that came from the ceiling and then came up with "caution", he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they could track business expenditures to the point of detail.
About the Pope's joke:
Jobs details the "blue box" he made with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to hack the phone company effectively and call for long distances free of charge.
The device has been written a lot before, but Jobs' euphoria here when describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using a pay phone, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until as many stations as possible were connected.
"We hit the globe half a dozen times, and you yelled at the machine phone, and it penetrated a minute later into the next phone machine," says Jobs with a laugh.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could make something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could have done a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple could ever have come out without it.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous stunt that he and Wozniak have practically dealt with by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the Pope to call, trying his best to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, the two were laughing just before the Pope himself was raised to answer the phone.
About the technology crush (and the cold name Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare details to assemble the frequencyometer, he found Bill Hewlett in the phone directory and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer job at Hewlett Packard.
"It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it formed my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP staff members who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the very first desktop computer".
He was the size of a suitcase, he had a little monitor with an electronic beam tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to go to HP as a teenager and spin around that car and write programs for her.
On improvised innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of installments, one buyer asked him to assemble an entire computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to think of both assembly and delivery of finished devices.
Later on in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember fierce spores... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to gather a mouse that would cost $300], and I was fed up, and went out, and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to raise for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About big companies losing energy:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs accurately anticipated how many industry leaders would be mistaken in their vision of the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these types of people] who eventually come to the management of the companies, and the people making the product are pushed out of the decision-making area.
The genius of the product that led to this monopolistic position is replaced by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
This is what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could capture the entire information technology industry.
It could be ten times bigger, could be a '90s Microsoft...
They were defeated by victory.
On innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea from the great product separates a vast amount of artwork ... when you twist the great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are compromises you need to make - some things you can't make electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head -- these concepts -- connecting them all together...
In the end, it all boils down to taste - all to try to express itself in the best that human beings have ever produced, and later - to try to bring it into what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made MacIntosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happened to be the best information technology specialists in the world.
If it weren't for information technology, they'd do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with opponents of the health law while the court is considering the case.
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether it would listen to the challenge of the health care law of President Obama, his two judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, honored the lunch sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before the highest court.
This case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss petitions.
One of the issues on the agenda was a motion supported by 26 states challenging the rapid health review adopted by Congress last year, a law that brought conservative activists across the nation together.
The judges agreed to consider the trial; indeed, a 5-1/2-hour wrap-up debate is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an impediment to the presidential race, which will be in the midst of a court decision being announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the health care law should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was Deputy Attorney General during George W. Bush's presidency.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual lunch of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group constantly defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the health law.
Honorary guests at lunch?
Nothing new: two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for many years.
This is not at all against ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were subordinated, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “A judge may attend charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a rapporteur, an honorary guest, or mentioned in the programme of such an event”.
Nevertheless, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with great financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the government.
"This stunning breach of ethics and indifference to the code contradict the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of General Affairs.
"Judges drank and had dinner at official fundraiser with lawyers now pending in court".
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for the event undermined all claims of impartiality and was unacceptable.
Skalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with groups appearing in cases such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives argue that this is the case with Judge Elena Kagan, not with Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal service in the Obama administration when the first court-level objections to the law were filed at the level of the court of the first instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse the hearing in this case because she was too involved in defending the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show that she was going to do that.
Boeing gets a record 18-billion-dollar plane order.
Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 wide-body liners and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal is over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it's an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft builder, and the price for all 50 planes is $18 billion.
Equally important is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, the growing gold lived future plane orders.
In a projection published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced his biggest dollar-equivalent order for commercial aircraft this weekend, 50 double-passing Boeing 777.
An incredible order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft that will raise the total price list price to $26 billion, said Boeing on Airshaw Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which can boast of much better fuel savings and passenger conveniences.
The price for six planes would be over $1 billion.
"It's really good for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neil Dior.
"The quality of these particular buyers is quite high".
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, not only do they have the money to pay for the aircraft, but the rise in the price of fuel, which usually harms airlines because it is one of the largest items of expenditure, is not so devastating because the country earns money at high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel the aircraft's order when prices rise, Dior said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
Emirates's order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the wide-fluzel market and helps prevent Airbus SAS rival from attempting to invade his dominance with his A350 airliner.
Boeing's victory on the air show took place four months after Airbus stated that he would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which competed just since 777-300ER.
He postponed his debut to increase the thrust after buyers demanded an increase in the lift capacity and range of flight.
Boeing Co's shares increased by 1.5 percent to $67.94.
The Mexican president's sister apparently lost in the Michoacán election.
Louise Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers assisted opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderón's sister did not seem to have implemented her bid for Governor Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers had helped to tilt the race in favour of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP, is the leader in the race for the seat of Governor of the Western State.
"The involvement of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but also for the entire country," said Louise Maria Calderón in a radio interview the day after Sunday's vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our employees in the election... they grabbed ballot boxes, put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the IRP.
IRP governed Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She's preparing to return, and winning Michoacán is an important step in this attempt.
IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only slightly outrun Calderon, who led the ratings until election day.
Calderón, a candidate for the National Action Party, or the PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate for the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP now owned by the Governor's chair, came third - a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital state of Morell, denied links to drug traffickers and called on other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine have long been dominant in Michoacán.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still ongoing.
The mayor from the PND was killed a week before the election when he campaigned for Louise Maria Calderon, and several candidates withdrew from the local election race due to fear.
For the IRP, however terrible the elections in Michoacán look, victory will give the party a driving force.
The man who is supposed to represent IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very inspiring in the run-up to next year."
AfDB convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing large economies must “do all they can” to speed up the rebuilding of the currency bloc through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties “intransigently” and said that Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
"It's all about us."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be to some extent protected, but it cannot be invulnerable".
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italian borrowing has increased alarmingly, and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The debt crisis unfolding in Europe has raised fears that it could lead the world economy to recession again, and has led to calls by leading developing economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian aid would be channelled through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as buying EU financial aid fund bonds, funds to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provided great bargaining power to Europe ' s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is currently experiencing a decline in exports and a decline in foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and troubled," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we must maintain high levels of growth."
"It's not a possibility, it's a prerequisite, because where we'll find a job for tens of millions of our boys and girls."
Others argue that it is pointless for developing economies like India to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Warsaw, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult politically to help Europe with 1.2 billion Indians, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will learn that Greeks retire at age 50 and go to the sea holidays, and that will not be accepted well," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers at work in poorly organized, wasteful enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatened “significant direct consequences” across Asia.
The ADB forecast of a 7.5 per cent growth rate in Asia in 2011/12 is now facing “punishable risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets need to draw up “emergency plans” to protect themselves from recession and large outflows of capital from their economies.
The Pentagon's Horrible Warnings of Potential Reductions in Defence Expenditure
Defence Minister Leon Panetta heated the atmosphere in Congress on Monday, warning that expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
The Pentagon is already adapting to a $450 billion cut in the coming decade, but now fears that additional cuts of 600 billion or more may be unavoidable if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the ministry," Panetta told the Senators in a letter to Republican John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to accept the budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequester would trigger a 23 per cent overall reduction and the termination of many new projects.
"Such a severe reduction, applied so recklessly, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building -- and will seriously undermine other modernization attempts," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We will also have to fire many of our civilian employees and, as the cuts will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to fire the civilian staff to achieve the goal."
"These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will seriously damage alert".
The cuts will eventually be affected by military units, Panetta said.
"Although military funding in foreign emergency operations is not directly sequestered, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious disruption in core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contract personnel will be reduced to end with cancellation of contracts and supervision contract that supports troops".
"Static staff will be reduced, resulting in late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted".
Two senators wrote to Panette 10 days ago asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts at the Ministry of Defence.
"The effect of the Department of Defense sequester will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power".
"We stand firm against these draconian actions," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday night when they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not a way we can live with, and it's not a way we have to impose."
"Secret is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and this cannot be allowed to happen".
Whether Panetta's letter or last warnings to senators will lead to a budget compromise or reinforce calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts, we'll see later.
Panetta was absolutely sincere about possible cuts, although he came to work in the Pentagon's leadership after years of conducting budget reviews in Congress and the White House and realizing that he faced a difficult choice.
At last week ' s press conference, the Minister of Defence drew a sad picture of what could happen next -- troops with a shell but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a squad without bullets."
"It's a wing of a plane without sufficiently trained pilots".
"This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers able to perform the mission," Panetta said in his introductory remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from unstable morale, poor readiness, and unable to fight potential enemies".
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta, he gave further details of how reductions “produce significant operational risks: slow responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be the first to deploy and respond anywhere in the world; and lead to unacceptable risks in future combat operations”.
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face obstacles, including those already tested, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 fighter jet, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal zone warship and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marines need to replace the Hummer.
The cessation of further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say it is a vital next step to improve and confront potential threats from China and other opponents.
How to Catch a Lie
A cursory look at the last headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Kane is busy challenging allegations of sexual harassment from several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The University of Pennsylvania administration was charged with perjury because they allegedly concealed the retired football coach raping the boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught telling U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was a liar when the microphone went on.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
Congressman New York City and Internet Exbiliator Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself denying his pranks, which was quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with financial fraud during a campaign involving the concealment of extramarital ties.
And again, none of those living at the time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton caught lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of fraud at school and college exams are common.
There have been instances where teachers have given students answers to tests in order to have a good assessment of their performance.
Mentors who have to teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
Within one day, studies show that you can be lied 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to save.
Another study revealed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Discovering a lie or proving a lie is a necessary skill for each individual for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game like, say, charades, where you have to say, "Got caught!", lying is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities involved in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been dispelled.
Liars look into the eyes.
They don't always stutter, stutter, blush or fuss.
There is no reason to conclude that liars are difficult to spot and difficult to expose.
An experienced liar can get to the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the mimic, the structure of the questions, and the time characteristics.
I have spent several years exploring scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-increasing segment of knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the detection of lies is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps guide our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interview, negotiation or management.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel relaxed, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie about others, usually to protect someone ' s feelings that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried ones (but that lie they say is most often brazen).
We also know that if you are perceived as a cheater, others will feel less guilty by deceiving you.
How do you know if anyone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
It's called "the definition of the initial state."
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing changes further.
Observe the pose, the laughter, the vocal characteristics of your object.
You might want to know if a person knocks with his feet all the time in normal condition, then you will not be making unfair accusations when you see a knock with his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and non-verbal acts.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
Liars can fix the upper part of their body when trying to remember their history, they can put their feet towards the door, lean towards the exit, change their pose in a certain way, or display "facilitation after interview" -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and pose change when all the difficult questions are behind.
Investigators often falsify the end of interrogation signal just to see that relief after the interview.
So, pay attention to your subject's speech.
Scott Peterson is known to have erred and used his past tense, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, leading to her search throughout the country.
Violating people can also use distance in the speech, "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat the complex question completely.
The most typical note indicators are barely detectable.
Someone can use a "qualification language" when they answer the complex question, "Okay... in truth... as far as I know... as far as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic tool to discover a lie, but you can master the skill of discovering a deception.
These skills will increase everyone's chances of not falling victim to skilled frauds in professional and personal life.
The disputed pipeline plan needs to be reviewed after the U.S. threat to delay approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of the planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering trade unions but comforting environmentalists -- the company planning to build the pipeline claims that it would willingly reconsider the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada reported Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of Sand Hills in Nebraska and is confident that the project will still receive approval.
The company voiced this decision at a press conference in Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Purbas says the company retains confidence that it will eventually obtain approval for the pipeline, albeit with another route.
This comes after the State Department's announcement last week that it will postpone a decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the area of the Nebraska Sand Hills and the Okhalala Aquifer, a huge underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental assessment commissioned by the Department of State is likely to postpone the decision until 2013, after the elections the following year, although the authorities denied that the decision involved politics.
In a written statement last week, Obama called the decision an appeal by the Department of State, and expressed support for it.
The 1,700-mile-long oil pipeline should extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He's supposed to transfer 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the oil refinery in Texas.
To do that, he needs to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but he is loved by trade unions, who hope for some 20,000 jobs associated with the pipeline.
But Nebraska legislators opposed to the plan are considering a bill to accelerate the movement of Sand Hills and Ogallala's aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
A current study by the Department of State on environmental impact has shown that the project will have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but a source in the energy industry has stated that the Department's auditor commissioned a separate review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an advisor to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether the firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was not suitable because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle was sued for allegedly nauseating her child in fear.
A family from New York claims that Patti LaBelle's disco-divada began to rage in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, scaring their young daughter to such an extent that the one threw up in fear.
Lady Marmalade's tyra scared 18 months old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered " personality change, sleep disorder" and "strong fear of strangers," says her family in the Manhattan Supreme Court.
This happened on November 10 last year when the working scene Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching a car, Rosanne Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanne Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down on the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, "You know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "Yes," she said.
LaBelle made an angry reprimand to a pregnant woman.
"She aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter by the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became furious and started using scolding -- the word on C and the word on F -- on heightened tone ...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I told this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escorts had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, said Rosanne Monk.
The baby cried so hard, she threw up, she added.
The family later sent LaBelle a note demanding an apology, but received no response.
The lawyer and LaBelle's representatives are not answering the phone for comment.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but a family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money that will be received to charity for children with cancer.
"The goal is to get Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for what he did," Davis said.
"This behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his arms".
Climate problems slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López's reign, unemployment and the illegal labour market increased in Sinaloa, foreign funding declined and the economy was weakened.
2011 — The year that will go into Sinaloa’s economic history as related to the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés, also referred to as a year of change that has raised high expectations for economic development, but given the adverse climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but a decline in basic economic performance has been recorded.
Not only did the low February temperatures result in millions of losses for the agricultural sector, but they limited the growth potential of the public economy, resulting in a 3.6 per cent overall decline in economic activity in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on the areas affected by the frost provided by the Council for Sustainable Rural Development of Mexico, 835.582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were all affected and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected, the main damaged crops being vegetables, maize and pots.
The decline in economic activity caused a steady increase in state unemployment until November, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters there was an accelerated increase in the unemployment rate, from January to March 55.053 Sinaloa residents were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the share increased to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September it continued to rise to 6.19%, the proportion of the population that is more than 74.000 Sinaloa unemployed, an increase of 18.969 from the first half.
Reducing liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is saturated by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly, by actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which involves several factors, including a loss of liquidity in the market to limit the resources imposed by the law that was passed in Congress to fight money laundering, because people who illegally own dollars have difficulty working with them, investing and using them in something," he said.
Remaining immigration
López Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state to seek employment abroad has been limited in the United States, primarily because of entry difficulties, and in the second because once they enter, they already face a lot of difficulties in finding work, so that a group of people stay and demand jobs here in the state, as a result, unemployment is increasing," he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The labour market analysis of Sinaloa is getting worse if you look at the large number of violations that prevail in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the active population of the state is working without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregular treatment, a further reminder of the state's employment is given by low wages; in the state, the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was until September 5.352 pesos, well below the national average of 7.375 pesos.
Reducing FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and high unemployment rates, 2011 saw the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, between January and July, state FDI was $630,697. This represents a decline of 87.74 per cent compared with $5,143.312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Minister of Economic Development of the State Government recorded only 17.280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which were mainly for service companies.
Debt
Against the backdrop of the economic downturn, the state government requested in July, during the state congress, approval of a 3 billion pesos loan that would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and until November no debt advantage was expected in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the government's Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wishes of the various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year has been really low, has to work hard to recover the positions lost this year, in 2012 we must redouble our efforts, we have failed to agree on the efforts of all and above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Lopez Loredo said that events such as early freezes this year stopped the state economy and its efficiency and growth were limited.
"The low size of the economy is the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that is not fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services, and therefore at the end of the year we close it below our expectations," he said.
Revision of direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said the state needs to continue the most dynamic production activity.
"By and large, we found that we were working on it, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, to mobilize all the material and human resources Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better guide the Government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there has been little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own way of conducting public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is beginning to get involved, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government realizes that much more needs to be done," he said.
He's being sentenced for eight kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days ' income - this sentence was imposed on a Navolato citizen for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney-General ' s Office reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who had been convicted of a crime against health, was in this case possession of marijuana for distribution purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during a patrol of Cypruso Valdes Street, before post No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup car in which he was carrying a black bag in the car box and a small backpack in the passenger seat, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continues to be imprisoned at the Centre for Support of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
We need to make contributions to the work.
Public works related to programs such as Motherland, Saving Public Spaces, and 3x1 for migrants risk remaining incomplete or long delayed due to lack of funds, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although the work programmes had been developed so far, they were in danger because the state government was unable to make contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which the state was expected to contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the work, so there was still room for delay in their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year is over, they haven't given us a penny when they should have given us a piece since the beginning of July," he said, "so as not to delay, we started work and they're very advanced, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions he had to make, so at the beginning of the term of government, the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, a sum that was not provided in the case of the state administration.
"It happened to us in the previous administration because the state had no financial opportunity to participate, and programs continued to evolve, and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we need to find the resources to cover what the state should remain," he explained.
While the state authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase efforts so that interest relating to them would arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court will approve the “digital television transition” in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals with digital ones is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which transfers the so-called “digital television transition” from 2021 to 2015, as there were no eight votes required to annul it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing actions to move to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, constitutional claims made by the Senate were dismissed on the basis of the absence of a qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a right enshrined by law in the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned therein regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the draft in the sense that the federal executive branch could not determine the general rules of the measure to be prepared by the public administration.
“I also do not believe that if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator” and recalled that planning public policy in strategic areas such as telecommunications has to do with the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the administration of the State.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital ones - one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years - has led to better use of radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization, which includes meeting public needs, which have not only a technical dimension, "as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These questions, he said, “requires the work of the entire system of public economic governance, which includes a group of authorities which the Constitution brings together in the executive branch of the State”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and had done so with the assistance of the executive, despite the existence of highly specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded from this that the Government, in adopting the decree under discussion, which in any event affects the competence of Congress, is enforcing the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly in the administrative sphere, he said.
Michoacán analyzes the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to data transferred to the PDP, the difference between the first and second seats in the gubernatorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes on 879 of the total of 6.074 protocols.
The ability to count “voice by vote” is real with regard to this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where, according to the Provisional Election Results Programme (PPRP), the difference between the first and second seats in the gubernatorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes that are 879 out of the total of 6.074 protocols.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (MCI), Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electorate had adopted a set of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán did not adopt the State Constitution or Electoral Code or the Electoral Law, as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal time of their entry into force in this electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication within the time frame specified in the law in the State Official Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (SJJ) ruled on a constitutional claim brought by the local legislature and called the state's constitutional reform representative's “valid and illegal” vote, as it had no right to “settling or supporting them”.
In an interview on the possibility of a “voice by vote”, Maria de los Ángeles Lünderal argued that, with the adoption of suitable principles by the General Council of the IWV, it would be possible to submit a partial or full count of votes to the local electoral body.
Thus, a partial recount of one or more ballot boxes may be made under the conditions that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting documents in the ballot box or is not in the possession of the chairman; or there are obvious errors or corrections in the record.
In addition, there may be a general recount of votes in all ballot boxes when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged winning candidate and the second ballot is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request at the beginning of the session from the party representative and/or the coalition that put out the second of the candidates mentioned.
A general recount will also be made if, at the end of the normal count, it is established that the difference between the winner and the second-placed candidate is less than or equal to 1 per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate took second place, in the event that the ballot boxes that were counted in part are excluded.
It is worth noting that this is the case for the elections in Morelia, where according to the EDP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16%, even excluding 129 votes out of a total of 923 protocols.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, confirmed by his family.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; an examination and a restful mass were conducted on Monday.
According to the family, the Lt. Colonel's last will was for his ashes to be scattered in the Sapalinam Mountains.
After accepting condolences along with other people who died in the disaster, the Basio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the Lt. Colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he was examined by the Santilio Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and a football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member during his high school studies.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and that his ashes be scattered in the Sapalinam Mountains, he always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Cortés Basio, the pilot's sister.
In her opinion, the Lieutenant Colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes he was at the height of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother loyal to his family."
Felipe Cortés Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to attend the Aviation College in Zapopana, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he was dizzy even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him as when he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan for his relative's diploma ceremony, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in his life: driving the plane.
He's on his way out.
Gunshots were fired after Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortés Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres López, people from the village and the state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo Technology High School, in which he studied in 1985 and made progress both in his studies and in sports, guided him on his final journey.
Basio Cortés recently died when the helicopter he was driving crashed, along with the Provincial Secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, the remains of Basio Cortés (cremate), resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral bureau to members of the Mexican Air Force led by Major James Martinez, to the esplanade of the training school where his family had already been waiting for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned at the NL Cadereita farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed the media eleven people who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in Kaderaita Jiménez Municipality, Nuevo León.
The discovery was found at 1.5 kilometres of the Cadereita Highway towards Santiago, on an elevation in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by noticed that the gates were open in a village house, the wall of which was painted in beige and brown.
When they looked inside, just three metres away, they found the bodies of three people, and immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and there was another man in a white shirt next to him.
Almost one metre contained the body of another person, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three were facing down.
According to evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no shell casings on the scene.
There are signs on the fence of the village house addressed to one organized criminal group by another, and there are several bullet holes in it and in the gate.
11 caught in Cadereite
The Ministry of National Security has submitted 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group operating mainly in the municipality of Kaderaita and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, “fraud” and secret graves.
According to published information, initially on 11 November, eight people were detained in the Los Alvero colony and one hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event took place on November 12 at 06:00 a.m., with military personnel conducting a patrol round the village of Old Rancho in Cadereite when he saw a car without license plates with two men in the salon.
After stopping them and inspecting them, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, after these statements, on 13 November, at 2 p.m., one of their accomplices was stopped on public land of La Truth, who, seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Cadereita.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monty, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce a new government that will face a crisis that has brought this country to the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and has damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will take its position.
Monty said he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not make it clear that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"Structure is now well-defined," he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy was grappling with the political and financial crisis that put their debt at a critical level
The Administration, under the leadership of former European Commissioner Monty, must approve the austerity package required by European leaders in order to restore confidence in Italy.
Based on pressure on Monty to hurry, unstable markets set the income from Italy's BTP bonds 10 years above 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Employers Federation, told reporters after meeting Monty, "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this Government is Italy's last chance to emerge from this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said reporters Angelino Alphano, secretary of the centrist-right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the government majority of technocrats that form Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty government should have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks increased pressure, warning that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations.
He'll end up meeting on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday Napolitano, which allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief hiatus at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would retire, Italy's debt value has now reached a critical level against the backdrop of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would be successful.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the eurozone’s modern financial defenders.
Monty said that his government would exist until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite widespread projections that politicians would only give him time to reform before setting up a new election.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be composed only of technical specialists, evidence of their dissatisfaction with the financial situation affecting the process.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
Spaniards have more gaming experience than Ticos.
Of the 22 players reported in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
On Costa Rica's side, only one out of 22 declared players played 50 games.
A minor contrast with Costa Rica, when compared to 22 players called by both countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While world and European champions, number one in FIFA's monthly ranking, have a whole list of class A qualifying games, Tricolor has only defender Michael Uman as the only one who has held 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
Spanish football players playing in the All-Star League and strong Premier League clubs were very active in the league and local cup competitions during this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and Champions League.
To this is added the experience of Spanish fury in complex qualifications in the Euro or World Cup.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the list is headed by the Spanish goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of ex-gulkiper Andoni Subizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hernandez, Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Javi were rated best last week by UEFA along with another player from the Iberian team, Subizarreta, with 126 matches and scorer Chalke Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Almost approaches a hundred Carlos Puyol with 97 games.
Javi Alonso followed them with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Inesta with 62, Sesk Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
Costa Rica next to Michael Umana, left side Junior Diaz with 48 matches and bombarder Brian Ruiz with 45.
Next, only five have crossed the threshold of 30 games: Calor Navas with 31, Randall Asofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36, and José Luis López with 35.
Remaining.
More than 30 Spanish matches with Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Buskets (36), Santiago Santi Kasorla (32), Alvaro Arbelloa (31) and Raúl Albiola (31).
In the team with less than 30 field appearances, there are Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Hordy Alba only has two games, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar only has one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet made their debut.
Spanish lead player David Villa with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz became the one who brought more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernandez and three times as much as Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet included the country on his 20th career tour.
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.'
In an exclusive interview with Viva bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band was ready to give one of the best concerts the following Sunday at the National Stadium.
There have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says it is also a dream for them that has become a reality, to play in this country.
This was a statement by bassist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is in South America on a 20th anniversary tour and will make its only stop in Central America on Sunday, the 20th.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with a team from Los Angeles The X and a local band, Las Robertas.
This is a passage from a conversation that is fully deciphered online in The Nation.
For your Costa Rican fans, is this a real dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
This is just our second visit to South and Central America, and so far it's going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once-- on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're very happy to bring our music there.
I ask that because there is some loyalty to the group; fans live in tension the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most devoted fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thanks for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat him like the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in San Paulo, and we hope it's got us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surfing friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as Mexico, these are great surfing places, that's how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say you made grand shows with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your performance in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we have no limits on what we can do.
We'll try to make the best show possible with a variety of songs; we'll try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in a tone and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting to us and so I think it makes it more interesting to people.
On this tour, you celebrate 20 years of your career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us could ever imagine that we'd be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for more than 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We rejoice in our luck, and we are very encouraged that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to make music.
We're happy to travel to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
Things are going very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the grunge's bloom?
It has always been an honour to be part of this group of great collectives.
We're good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney, and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, one group from the same city appears, but much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We're proud and honored to be part of the Seattle band.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them and we're honored to be part of Seattle's sound that came out.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same lineup for so long.
Yeah, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups exist.
First, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and secondly, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, music roads have also been opened that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't have been better.
Your attitude to the word of glory was difficult; but thanks to your success, you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to strike a balance.
We care not to be on the tour too long, because it's easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what made it without deciding to be famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs and it was great at the beginning.
We've been a band for almost three years and we haven't released a single album, until Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There were a lot of disappointments because it's been so long, and most important that we're still close friends with Bruce (Ferweser) and Greg (Gilmore), who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a picture, I think about the incredible man Andy was, and how he made me laugh, it's always been a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football, and a lot of other things.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her to open it?
Yeah, the producers sent us some video offers, and it was the band we liked the most, so we're looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer in person, and it's got to be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing the words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Wedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he's using the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Gizer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the grunge even though he is no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a bit detached from the word grunge.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and everyone who appeared at the same time, and if that's important now, I think it's wonderful, because it's music that's worth listening to, and teams like Mudhoney make music now better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How do you explain this change?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very grim, although they may sound a little positive.
From both, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs were very dark.
I think that when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lost a family member or a friend, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical examination
Ex-President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at a public hospital, to be examined for loss of muscle force in his legs, reported by his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which has resulted in him being operated on four times and under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal physician, told television channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of force in his lower limbs.
Aginaga said that he believed that Fujimori should be a candidate for the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He endured four operations on language cancer, lost 18 kilograms in weight, to which other diseases, such as severe erosive gastroitis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and leg circulation problems, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Special Operations Police Department.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by a unit of destruction of the army, which operated in secret during the early years of his rule.
Muhika goes to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by President José Muhika of Uruguay and composed of several ministers and businessmen will come to Mexico this Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to start negotiations on the region ' s political problems.
Muhika will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderón, the most important item in an extensive plan to meet with the political, commercial and community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, in accordance with a schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two Presidents in Guadalajara will be "favourable for the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations", as the South American leadership published on its website.
According to local media, Muhika seeks Calderon's support for Uruguay in an incident with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included South American country on the list of tax havens at a G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remained tax havens a statement that provoked Uruguay's protest and recall for his ambassador's consultations in a European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group formed from the most developed and developing countries, and has in fact had an agreement with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to expedite the conclusion of tax exchange agreements in order to leave the grey list of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, drawn from countries that do not use international standards for tax cooperation.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay had been in force since 2004 with the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which had increased trade between the two countries.
The mustache plumber will become three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought relentlessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser's evil paws, but he never did it in three dimensions: at Super Mario 3D Land, he would fight for a girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in stores around the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows for three dimensions to play without the need to use points.
"Mario is a hero who has to report how stereoscopy will work without glasses," said Nintendo's head of press in Spain, Omar Álvarez, while presenting the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game specially designed for this platform" because until now successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo stated that despite the existence in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "accessible" video game that allowed for the enjoyment of a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
One day, most experts will go "second-round" to the levels of the game, which is this time more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of action, but which needs to be played in three dimensions to overcome a variety of obstacles and "not succumb to optical illusions."
This invasion of Super Mario into three dimensions also marks the hero's return to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks the fans of the series and repeats a successful formula from previous games, a plumber with mustaches needs to walk through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new movements, decorations, costumes, and enemies, as well as "playing" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom said Tuesday that the extradition process of Alfonso Portillo had begun to answer in the United States for a plot to launder $70 million.
This is the end of the process by which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which requested Portillo's extradition to try him there.
At a press conference, Colom said that his decision was linked to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, given that the court of first instance had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that, during his mandate, he had not “handed” legal decisions and had taken all extradition procedures of which he had ever been aware.
Along with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marroquín, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done shows the executive process after all the legitimate and constitutional courts have been exhausted to prosecute the ex-Head of State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and the guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty of misappropriation of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove's social support organization are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social exclusion have helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter century.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs have been created for this social group.
The anniversary served as an occasion for the outcome at a ceremony held at the premises of the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove came to life near Trinity Valley in 1986 to help young people with lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or vulnerable to marginalization.
Yesterday's Sant Andrew celebration brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that collaborated with the association during these 25 years.
Different political perceptions during the election showed the same nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Following the President of Generalita, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Hordi Pouhol, the ceremony was attended by an ex-consul of Socialist Education, Ernest Maraghal, and an ex-Lieutenant mayor and a current eco-socialist, a member of the municipal council, Ricardo Goma.
He also appeared at Fabra I Coats current social welfare and family consultant, Josep Lewis Cleris and SEA social work consultant La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove came into existence at a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The Chairman cited Trinijove as an example of fighting against bad circumstances and instilling hope in people in difficulty.
"Crisis is not new to the organization and work done to her," he said.
Captured building, where mass parties were organized, evacuated
Capturers occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday at noon without a struggle
It seems that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors living at 51 on Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left the building yesterday at noon voluntarily, which they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that irritated neighbours, by court order without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, there'll be a security clearance," said the manager.
The squatters who seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest inhabited, appropriated all the electricity and part of the water, painted walls and left traces of various kinds, especially alcohol banks.
The first three floors were a venue for mass parties that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Right outside the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, reported to Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has declined by 80%.
The owner of the club says the invaders of the building dragged her into an unfair competition as they sold drinks for three euros, while at the club for ten.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to the neighbors' complaints about noise, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by club visitors, but by the residents of the squat and, above all, by those who attended the parties that were organizing there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, as angry neighbors said.
The owner of the club said the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now he's been "good-bye" to her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
The chairman of the municipal group PP, councillor Alberto Fernand Díaz, demanded last week "immediately to evacuate the building to address the problems of coexistence and shared spirit among neighbours and degradation in this area."
The popular leader explained that until summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months the squatters had invaded all floors and almost every room, and that some of them had had break-in.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to resist the culture of the building."
So yesterday, the police evacuated the building to Know Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police left for Montral Street, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the possibility of a competition after disputes about contributions
The 16-door municipal contest resumed the debate on the role of Colcerola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CBC), this administration printed promotions for Colserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park in Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with New York Central Park.
With the death of the KCB, in 1987 the park again took its place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that is oriented not to the north-south but to the up (gore) - down (sea).
The position of Colcerola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as Yogi bear.
This was so until, in September, the council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates in Colserola.
The gate refers to the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is: Colcerola? Park or mountain?
The competition, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are the subject of discussion for all Barcelona architects.
It's almost the most recurring topic discussed when two members of this clan of elected people recognize each other in the elevator.
And this fact leads precisely to one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present say.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: The competition is appropriate
For Roldan, once the shoreline is reached, it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front side of the mountain" when the proposal of Ildefon the Heart, a mountain with green apples, has not been implemented.
"We need to assume Barcelona's biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, because of its excellent accessibility.
Colserola is more complicated," says the architect, for whom the title of the Colserola Gate contains a "word trap": we should not think of them "as entering the park, but as limiting some areas where we must act."
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayona with experience in urban construction, called the proposal an "intelligent task" with "some dangers."
Risks arising from the "uncertainness of public space prediction" following the experience of the 1980s, which ended at the Forum's "his swan song" site.
The first fear is the very limitation of the boundaries where you can build.
"The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step," I mean, the transition.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [as far as the Capital Master Plan (CGP)] is concerned can lead to real trouble."
Towards the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserola Valley "may be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographic matter.
Modolo recalls that there is already a work done outside Calcerola, which "should not be missed," although he is grateful for the opportunity the City Hall offers his profession to enter the project "from the beginning."
Moreover, he realizes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter into debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is something that should lead interdisciplinary teams ("success", he claims), which was to create: "Architects should only be an instrument."
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that asks the name of this part is complex, as the rules of the competition lack a general view of Colserola: "There were 16 overlapping contests," he says, "by the meaning of the sea mountain, but there is no longitudinal reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This leads, at least in his case, to a decision to compete in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one gate may overlap with the architect's project for the neighboring gates.
From your point of view, the council needs to ensure that the strip directly above Rhonda de Dalt provides in its entirety an area equipped to create a smooth transition between town and green.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, Red Casino's court representative forgave Mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial against him on extortion charges.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be free after the legal representative of Red Casino has granted him forgiveness to the Second Criminal District Court, which is in the process of extortion against the brother of Mayor Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photographs and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded an economic contribution from him so that the authorities of Monterrey would allow a secret operation at the gambling house.
Following a public conviction, the Attorney-General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on 2 September he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the capital state.
He remained at the site for 49 days following a second restraining order after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereita, allegedly for extortion of half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in a prison with a moderate degree of isolation because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his stay at the San Nicholas Municipal Prison in Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest order was issued by the Registrar of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that after almost two months of investigation, there was ample evidence of Jonas' guilt, such as charging 1.5 million pesos with bookmakers in exchange for permission of the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek pardons for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released within the next hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomez whether he had compensated for the damage and which of the partners of the gambling house granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried not to give a name.
Based on the recording of 197/2011, Jonas Larrasabal has been granted a legal pardon, and no further statements can be made about the trial that was planned against him; nor will any reparation or punishment be required.
After hearing the legal representative of the bookmakers, at almost 3:50 p.m., it was ordered that Larrasabal Breton be released immediately.
A court clerk, Jorge Janes, went to San Nicholas Municipal Prison in Garza to inform Jonas that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Pérez Hacome describes the details of the disaster that killed the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Minister of Communications and Transport (SIT) reported that results obtained in an accident in which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others were killed, showed that the helicopter hit the ground directly in full integrity, without the pilot attempting to make an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found that weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"Elements that seem to indicate that the ship had several contacts with the ground, wings came into contact with trees 25 metres away where the substance lost its fluselage".
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively it met the necessary requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that studies conducted in the impact area did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
“The study reports that there are no components of the vessel elsewhere, and the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant passenger transport requirements.
The ground in this place has a seven to 30 degree gradient.
At this point, the secretary said, the most important thing is to get the results as soon as possible; however, the study may take a few months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto López Meyer, CEO of Airports and Support Services, said that during the strike, the presidential helicopter was driven at cruise speed and that it happened on soft rising soil.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal flight manoeuvre at the moment of impact," he said.
At a press conference, SCT owner, Pérez Hacome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation regulations, the flight was conducted according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the crew must have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified suitable conditions for taking off when the aircraft headed to the border territory between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where cloud layers were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that because of the conditions of cloudiness, the team was searching for a smaller height and greater visibility in the Quernawak Valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording from the aircraft radar are likely to coincide before the impact there was no loss of control or change of direction.
Fragmentation of debris in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact was on the front and side lines.
The scattered debris suggests that the helicopter collided with the ground under structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were found:
In the disaster zone, there remains undetected evidence in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies show that there may have been multiple contacts with the land.
During work on the site, pieces of aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the ground ranges from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several clashes with the ground.
After careful research, more than a defined area near the site of the disaster, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, reinforcing the assumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity.
MSS announces the Obese gene search program
Social protection leads research on finding obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN experts
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect obesity in children and young people, known as the protocol “Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence”, which will provide an estimate of the signs of overweight.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Biochemistry Research Unit of the National Twenty-first Century Specialized Hospital, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietologists and social workers had been assembled.
The team is assisted by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
The study invites the public (written or not) to participate by going to MSSI sports centres participating in the study to the Mexico Valley, where tests with children will be conducted every Saturday morning at 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol had begun at the Cuautemoke Sports Centre (in western Mexico State) and that since 8 October events had been held at the Nesaualcootle Sports Centre (in eastern Mexico State).
Once the target of 500 to 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Centre (South Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (North Mexico City).
He explained that the aim of the study was to understand the components and importance of genetics in relation to obesity development and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans in order to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
The World Diabetes Day will be observed on 14 November, and the main objective will be to gather 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 with parental permission and supervision to complete individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and the history of family inherited diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or renal failure.
He explained that anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist grip), blood pressure and glucose levels, fats, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify genes associated with childhood obesity) would be conducted on Saturday.
Cruz Lopez said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in the weight of children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that there has been an increase in just six years: 77 per cent of boys were obese, 47 per cent of girls; and there has also been a significant increase in overweight," said MSSI.
He said that the justification for looking for markers was based on the fact that the population was different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican was 65 per cent American Indian, 30 per cent European and five per cent African, a condition that affected genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that the main effect of obesity genetics is the body's inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and it is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to participants was a comprehensive assessment of children, which could determine whether they had any excess weight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck (acants) and forearms means the likelihood of metabolism being violated and even prediabetes.
The information is given in full confidentiality and is transmitted in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and changes in lifestyle that must be made to avoid the disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there were three main reasons for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sitting lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of television, and using transport at short distances instead of walking.
This is also due to high calorie consumption, i.e. increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (taleh, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with large fat and protein content and genetic predisposition analysed in this program.
UNAM asphalt can avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of best quality resistant to environmental and temperature effects.
If attention were paid to road-cover signals, it would be necessary to repair about 200,000 pits for each rainy season in the metropolitan area of Mexico City, says Rafael Herrera Nahera, researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of the paved road surface is correct, the number of pits can be reduced or even reduced to zero.
His lecture The technological perspective on pits read within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry reports that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture with characteristics close to bitumen but with better resistance both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and therefore resist the formation of pits.
He explained that the bitumen, the hardest part of the oil, was the sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some high molecular mass called asphalts, and others low molecular mass called Maltens, which together gave road coverage to its characteristic viscous behaviour.
The viscous behavior of bitumen is the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it behaves like liquid at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it retains a near solid state, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that street asphalt resistance is not constant, but changes during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, said a specialist in chemical engineering.
A chemical scientist observed that the streets of Mexico City were mostly covered with flexible coating, which was made up of six layers of material, of which the last three included bitumen.
Among the uppermost layers is a bitumen made of small stones dropped into the bitumen and then compressed.
Every stone that makes up this coating, he said, is in bitumen.
When driving and working, this helps the forces to spread very well on the road surface.
If it were modified asphalt, they would be distributed even better, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt surface, he added, there is a last layer, which is called a layer of wear, which is made of a small stone, actually sand also immersed in asphalt.
As it is a layer that will contact the wheels of transport, it should have more resistance than asphalt coating and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute these forces, the wear layer also requires adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
The weather, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the condition of the asphalt.
When the ground is raw, the water penetrates the surface and it is difficult for it to get out of it, it softens all the layers of the surface and hence the formation of pits.
In creating pits, he said, the wear layer first wears out and only then affects bitumen, but damage does not occur instantly, which should be addressed at the first signs of maintenance programmes.
A member of the National Research System also explained that transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of coating must always be linked to traffic load and this requirement must be guaranteed in order to prevent the frequent appearance of pits.
Rafael Herrera said that relatively bitumen still has a lot to study and do, for example, bitumen emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and even help fix pits with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What wasn't enough for a Valle candidate to become a new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serena Melina Ramirez from getting Miss Colombia's crown.
The representative of Valle was granted the title of Princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca's only wish to get Miss Colombia's crown.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna should have been content to have reached the winners' podium with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her new princess of Colombia.
Based on the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and sceptre, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the crown but were declared princesses, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domínguez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonzuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Hiseye Alhour Garce (2000), Catalina Hiraldo (2007), Stephanie Garces Alhore (2008).
The question that many people are asking now is:
What's not enough? Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who in each of the performances demonstrated that she has everything to become the new Miss Colombia, for a reason she was elected Queen of the Police and the most beautiful person in Vogue, the titles the Queens held, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received Miss Colombia's crowns.
The first factor that played a part in the jury's decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she was unable to respond convincingly to the question "What book characterizes you and why?," posed by Martin Murilla Gomez of the literary society Let's read.
She said to the questioner,
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I definitely think the book characterizing my childhood is Little Prince is a pretty deep book.
Today I'm reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; I'm also reading the book of Irina of Nemirovsky, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called "The Fire of Blood."
An answer that the jury did not like because of the term "culture" and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the books quoted characterized it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said that she was calm and satisfied with her result: "The universe is wise, what is going to happen."
All of you, please read a little, Little Prince is a great book.
Among the hypotheses voiced, Valle was burned by favoritism.
A reporter from Bogotá suggested that because she was preferred, she was greeted with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster's culinary competition, the audience vote for the best national costume, and Queen Mother), "which aroused the jealousy of other candidates, provoked stress on the Queen, and consequently she did not shine on stage."
And this was noted during her first appearance in a bathing suit on Hilton Beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, she was noticeably lacking the strength and energy demonstrated by Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for the "How Home" program on RCN, said that the fact that Milena was called a princess "suggests that a candidate who wins more awards during the competition doesn't become queen"
Moreover, the representative of Valle had recently avoided contact with the press and that had been wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Competition of Beauty.
That's why two days before the selection, Lucy Doty, a member of the international jury, said they were looking for a woman dedicated to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Columbia, we must look not only at appearance, but also focus on public consciousness, before they compete, they should already be involved in projects," she said.
There is also a suggestion that the representative of Valle sinned with defects on the buttocks and fibrosis that was seen on her stomach, but this is controversial as the jury highlighted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", given her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen Jorge Hernan Orosco's consultant notes that Melina did not have the best body, which was better, "but fibrosis problems on my stomach, which were not very visible to me, caused her to lose glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Cromos magazine believes that the error of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she was subjected to surgical intervention.
"Operations are good, but Representative Valle doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was awarded for the first time by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, the cruel prediction came true last night, they say it was an woodpecker that Raimundo gave Melina as compensation for losing her pleasure in getting the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that Melina is beginning a year of government today, not as queen, but as princess, a position that enables her to represent Colombia at an international competition identified directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will go into history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena contest, faced difficulties in getting the crown.
That was the work of the man who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
A CSI from Cali has entered history as a man who confirmed Alfonso Cano's death.
The work of these employees is crucial.
On November 4, CTI CTI Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of FARC head Alfonso Cano by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI forensics experts this week, it is the turn to "courage" Elizar González, a man from Puerto Tehad, who spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to sneak through the jungle for more than five days to reach the place where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and, after completing the relevant courses, he became a specialist in forensics, where he studied skin friction, i.e. palms and irons.
During the week of the Elizar operation to identify a man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take his clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was coming.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Kauca to Palmira.
He knew that he would have to identify the two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten prints of Guillermo Leon Saens (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not identify it by its appearance; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed as a local farmer, with no glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, blade, and lantern, Elizar compared the body's fingerprints to those on the pictures.
His eyes didn't fail: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the representative of Puerto Tehad was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinson, that it was the leader of the FARC.
Searching for Fingerprints
The confession received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizard González at a press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly significant for Sijin of Cali.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Dactiloscopy is a rigorous science, without error, it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to the identification of bodies, dactiloscopy specialists participate in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and determine the identity of the detainees.
Many criminals have forged identity papers or no documents at the time of their arrest.
We're taking their prints and we're looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that in the event of the theft, he had to carry a piece of the wall of the house because in this place the thief had to lean his hands in order to possess a safe, full of jewels and money.
"The walls are hard to work because they are not convenient surfaces for prints, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole palm and identify the perpetrator who took part in several thefts," he states.
Prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
A dead man with liquor bottles around him was recently found.
In the course of the investigation, it was established that a relative might have been suspected of committing the crime and that the fingerprints on the bottle did indeed match.
Although it doesn't guarantee he was a murderer, it proves he was at the scene of the murder.
A fingerprints specialist from CTI explained that a chemical or physical reagent is applied to places where fingerprints are available.
When they appear, a blade or tape is used to remove them.
The prints are then sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered into the register.
"The problem is we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," said CTI expert.
He explained that not everything was as shown in the CSI television program.
Just like not all the gold that shines, not all that you touch keeps your prints on it.
However, if possible, a comparison shall be made.
Angry people challenge New York City authorities.
Hundreds of protesters camped in front of Zuccotti Square.
Some protesters listened to the court's decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and headed to the park next door.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York City authorities on Tuesday when they tried to re-enter, under court order, Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated at dawn while attempting to capture another Great Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters piled up near Zucotti Square, where they wanted to go thanks to a court order that allowed angry people to break up camp in the square while the other part of the movement responded to the crackdown, capturing a park in the north of the city where further arrests were made
"Our idea is that, since the court won't allow us to break up a camp in the square, we will break up the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zucotti and through peaceful sit-in strikes and demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a member of the "Capture Wall Street" movement.
Bray explained that the response of "enraged people" to the evacuation of the tent town, which had been ordered personally by the Mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg, had entered a court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing demonstrators to stay in the camp.
In addition, the angry people began to seize a new park located at the site of the confluence of the Canal Street and Sixth Avenue Central Streets, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the owned parish of the Trinity Church.
At least an hour they could have occupied the place, but then the police arrived and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not give the exact number, but told Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization assures that several hundred people were standing with tents at the location where the delegation of religious leaders went to show support to the movement in an attempt to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zucotti Square, which is a private possession, remains closed pending the court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, which will address the legality of this morning's dispersal of the protesters.
Some of the protesters on their way there carried and distributed copies of that court order and even gave the copies to the police guarding the square, leading to "some small clashes," said Bray, who stated that some police officers had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Occupy Wall Street movement and forcing them to comply with “laws that were issued after the seizure began, or preventing demonstrators from re-entering the park with shops and other property previously used”.
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of this court order, the city had suspended the opening of public space and demonstrators had been informed, but local laws prevented them from reopening tent stores and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zucotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made, and the decision was made because the protesters "wrong the law".
Bloomberg said he ordered the area cleared because it became "a place where people came not to protest but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others," because "some businesses received threats" and neighbours feared "for a deterioration in the quality of life."
The evacuation carried out this morning was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers, added a spokesman who condemns the mayor for "regarding freedom of speech."
Those responsible for Capture Wall Street also indicated that they intended to organize “grandiastic events” on Thursday, in conjunction with public organizations and trade unions, to recall the last two months of the protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show.
Along with Michael Buble and other distinguished Canadians, she will appear on the television program Russell Peters Christmas on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at Big Repair, a lifeguard at Malibu Saviors, Bunny at Playboy, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will become the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
CTV's private television channel announced today that Anderson, along with the crooner (the performer of the ballad), Michael Buble and other outstanding Canadians, would appear on the December 1st, Russell Peters Christmas television program, as a very special Mary.
CTV today introduced footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for the widely distributed Internet domestic pornographic video where she appears with her then-husband, drummer for Tommy Lee's "Mötley Crue" band, appears dressed as Virgin Mary, holding a doll depicting Jesus in the nursery.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Indian-born Canadian comedian who recently acted as host of Charlie Sheen's "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's special Christmas show features Canadian singer Buble, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March to the Argentine model Luisiana Lopilato and who also knows good about scandals.
Bubble recently called "bitch" American woman Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan Revived After the Earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent thanks to domestic consumption and ended the decline that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that has caused a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe since World War II.
According to the Tokyo government’s first estimate, the material losses amounted to $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the dire world situation, seems to be passing.
After three consecutive loss quarters, gross domestic product data from July to September definitely helped turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent on an annual basis.
Registered in the second quarter, the Japanese fiscal year begins in March 2012 and also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The revival may be partly explained by the revival of the purchase of machine equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the tsunami that followed.
Indeed, companies increased their investment by 1.1%, against a 0.9 per cent decline in capital expenditure from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the true change in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian momentum, which calls for the crisis to be used to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure, using the gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, mainly due to the development of household consumption, which now stands at 60 per cent of Japan ' s GDP.
This rate increased by 1% due to increased expenditure on cars, travel and recreation.
Yen brand
Tokyo provided the domestic market when the yen, the Japanese currency, became one of the “currency shelters” chosen by investors who want to get rid of the euro area debt crisis and negative forecasts of the US, a privilege that squeezes, like stone, into the accounts of exporting companies.
With more currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a major blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sonia, for example, blame the yen for their low performance from July to September.
As markets continue to siege the EU's hinterland countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government does not lessen vigilance.
We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the dramatic rise in yen values, said Economic Policy Minister Motohis Furukawa yesterday.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries showed clear signs of a slowdown in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts the fractures in the world economy, has shown that major forces are slowing down.
It then fell by four tenths to 100.4 points, from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average of 100 points after it hit eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens provides the ground for doubt again
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but the Conservatives would not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk and uncertainty prizes that prevailed in the parks, Greece continues to wander around the maze, which leads to a recovery from the great European debt crisis.
The sense that the “consent” of the new Transitional Government of Ellada is imposed by Brussels rather than by the true belief of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos warned yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon at his appointment might not be sufficient for their application, Conservative Party leader Antonis Samaras assures that he would not support new austerity measures in any way and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled for 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, said Papadimos yesterday, opening a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow in a vote of confidence by the new executive branch.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, reform of the civil service disciplinary code and new measures to combat tax evasion would be the first innovations.
However, Samaras' message does not clarify his position: “We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing”.
The leader of the Conservatives took one step more in his sentiment about the EU and IMF, the organizations that should unfreeze the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needed, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of agreement on the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effect of the Papandreu referendum's assertions of everything or nothing, repeated yesterday that its demands are unequivocal: it will not resume aid unless the new Greek government and major party leaders sign a "written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible."
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafai, said that the Troika inspectors could return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what must be done to pay for the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been set.
There's enough thread in the Greek ball for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized Spain's “core” place in relation to this type of finance.
Spain "has a prominent place in the world in microfinance".
Queen Sophia recalled yesterday that in the past two decades the country had become the second largest donor of cooperation instruments whose “existence” she said was a “tool for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind based on faith in people”.
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “perfectly necessary” to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and “especially with the aim of halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which the “poverty line” is recorded.
Spain “is still working” to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes on the task with full “responsibility”, says Doña Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements of the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for the women “the principal recipients of these loans”.
There are "many achievements" and "many difficulties we face."
The microcredit summit is not only a debate space, but also a platform that promotes “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and a hundred million of those households would emerge from the poverty into which they were immersed.
The impulse to establish a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world “walked along the path begun years ago” by Muhammad Yunus was emphasized by Ms. Sofia as “an act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as "an amazing idealist in the global fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, since the Queen went to Bangladesh to examine his lending policy locally.
One year later, this experience was replicated by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I've seen continuous development everywhere," said Her Majesty, whose connection to the project brought her yesterday's title of “head of the family” collected in Valladolid as a “banker of the poor”.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her statement by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and to find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
“Ethical imperative”
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity was an “ethical imperative” for every democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with times of economic boom, as it was a “permanent commitment”.
Jiménez concluded that microcredit implies “a serious and firm commitment to poverty eradication”, and now “more than ever” the Governments of developed countries should work in solidarity and prevent it from falling into spending cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, praised the “success” in giving “confidence” to people “who have all the doors closed” and Mayor Valladolid Francisco Javier León de la Rivas welcomed all those present in the city, which “opens its doors in the spirit of solidarity”.
HDZ proposes to elect the Chairman of the European Commission by a universal vote
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDD) Congress on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, passed without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned for in the program, but it came up in the fall itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is far from as strict as it should be today with regard to Greece and perhaps tomorrow with regard to Italy....
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, submitted for discussion by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The standing ovations, which lasted several minutes, who earned their performances by Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schoible, the Europhiles and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main message of the chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct answer to the crisis is “not less than Europe, but more than Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the chancellor, "it's time for a breakthrough in Europe."
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty, making it possible for the European Union to strengthen its control over the financial policies of the Eurozone countries, but it may also affect the election of the European Commission President by a general vote “to give Europe a face”.
At any rate, this is one of the proposals for a draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which obviously belongs to Wolfgang Schöyble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly accept this decision; Britain opposes it, and HDZ leaders believe Nicolas Sarkozy is against it, too.
But the soil is prepared.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each European Union member country in the European Central Bank Board according to the size of each economy, which would have greatly increased the weight of the German economy.
Desiring to calm the situation in her party, the chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence the Congress by “small” European countries or countries in a difficult situation that like to criticize “higher” Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devotes an entire paragraph to the importance of “German-French friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Only in passing.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig became a scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What's sick leave fraud?
Following the cash benefits, UMP and the government began an attack on hospital leaves.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefits Fund and make a speech on this issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, on the fight against social benefit fraud.
And in order to help this offensive that arose out of a desire to save in a difficult situation, but also as part of the campaign of right-wing re-election to presidents, most want to concentrate on hospital leaves.
In the first instance, with a view to budget savings, the Government intends to impose on private employees a fourth day of unpaid leave prior to the start of payment of the benefit.
Apparently, without the special consent of the employer, a sick worker would lose a four-day salary equal to at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to breed a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will result in savings of 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, imposing a day on public servants without a sickness benefit (public employees have not yet had to wait for payment of a benefit, as opposed to a three-day waiting period for private sector workers).
Now that these issues are being discussed, most also re-open the topic of fraud, with a view to abuse in the issuance of sick leave.
Control will become tougher and more, if you are caught, you will have to return all the payments you have illegally received," warned Xavier Bertrand on RTL on Saturday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of sick leave.
Indeed, they have been subjected to constant monitoring and political attacks since 2002, which have borne fruit.
People in France are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's look at the country figures first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), over 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, daily compensatory expenditures in 2008 amounting to 11.3 million euros accounted for 5 per cent of total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46 per cent related to maternity leave and accidents at work and 54 per cent to sickness benefits, which amounted to €6.2 million.
Consequently, 2.5% of health-related costs were incurred.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days on hospital in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group study.
Average arithmetic, which conceals some deviations; another study published in 2007 by Monster.com's career management website revealed that 75 percent of the 40,000 French workers interviewed said they had not taken a single day of hospital care.
Another study, this time on health insurance, states that in 2010, 37 per cent of the hospital population lasted less than 8 days, 15 per cent from 15 days to one month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent lasted longer.
By comparing these figures with those of European neighbours, it can be seen that French workers are no more likely to take hospital care than workers in any other country.
A lengthy study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001 the overall unemployment rate in France (for health reasons or not) varied between 10 and 11 per cent, compared with 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of hospital sheet fraud is very low compared to grey employment.
As for the level of fraud, it's very low.
The tightening of the law after 2002 resulted in a systematic check-up of the hospital for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million cases examined, CNAM found that 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term illness reports were “unjustified” or too long, or 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked sick leave of more than 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were “inappropriate or unjustified”, which is 132,000.
Overall, 169,000 cases are found to have been “unjustified” for several million workers who received sick leave.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, for example, grey employment figures.
According to UMP MP Dominic Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, they amount to between €9 million and €15,000 million of lost budget revenue per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore is infinitely higher than the loss from fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
This was announced on Monday 14 November in Parliament by Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition government had not been sufficient to accomplish this task.
"In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening a debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October should be the new Government's “major task” because the country's presence in the Eurozone is “at stake”, he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos projects a reduction in the country's budget deficit to about 9 per cent of GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The Right Rejects the Measures of the New Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said in a meeting with his Party MPs for New Democracy.
He expressed his agreement with the objectives of reducing deficits and debts and combating waste, but also his rejection of any course that impeded economic recovery.
Olly Renu, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the required Euro8,000 million credit without written assurances from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and suicide with outside help must be legalized, a committee of experts says.
Canadians are denied death, as stated in the Royal Society of Canada report
With regard to palliative medicine, the committee argues that the Government, health institutes and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, and this does not include cases of cancer.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from different fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the Criminal Code to allow for suicide with outside assistance and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
For starters, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in 10th place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death."
Due to medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
The country's highest rate is Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide with outside help, the report concludes that it contradicts the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to change anything in the Criminal Code with regard to euthanasia and suicide with outside assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in use, i.e. the exercise of euthanasia or suicide with outside assistance against people who are unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, during a teleconference, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed that most of these cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide with outside help were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is apparently illegal.
Suicide with outside help is practised in Canada, where it is apparently illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for Euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 percent of Canadians advocate euthanasia because, according to an Angus Reid survey in 2010, they believe that this will enable people to alleviate their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are of lesser value.
With regard to persons who assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of those interviewed believed that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care, the situation was less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest, among other recommendations, that the Criminal Code should establish that a legal termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained to respect the abandonment of health care at the end of their lives without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee encourages the Government, health-care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation already widely applied in Canadian health institutions, the committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to dull physical pain like euthanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments by other experts
Some experts in the field of health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Mr. Pierre Deshan, a specialist in health legislation, described as “extreme” the position of experts who had signed the report, for, inter alia, it did not limit the use of euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide, says metre Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metr Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place individual independence above all other values that made up the social fabric of society.
He said, "There are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
Health legislation expert Margaret Somerville also expresses “a categorical disagreement with the findings of the report, which she described as “manifest for euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, inter alia, the report's data concerning abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide with outside help are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls upon President Assad to surrender power
Damascus condemns the “conspiracy”
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar Al-Assad held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure increased on Syria, Bashar Al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists him and condemns the “conspiracy” against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syrian neighbours Turkey and Jordan defended the resignation of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to call upon President Bashar Al-Assad to surrender power in Syria, where some forty more civilians and regime military personnel were killed.
"If Bashar were to have the best interests of his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, said the King of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
In turn, the Foreign Minister of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoğlu, expressed regret that Turkey ' s mediation efforts, which had begun earlier this year, had failed.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “extension of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly tough stance against the repression in Syria, as noted by Mark Toner, a representative of the Department of State.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime ' s armed forces have died in the Dar ' a area in southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents died in an exchange of fire and heavy machine gun fire in Jobar in the besieged town of Homs, according to this ONG.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis."
He also reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, promising that this plot against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires that 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers be treated in the country.
France's Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, also advocated sending United Nations observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime that, he said, fell into a “paranoia”.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the recovery plan adopted on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from fighting cities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision “incorrect”, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to overcome the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monty, asked the markets for a little time to form his team and execute a program that would require "victims" to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's reign.
The former European Commissioner participated in discussions with political parties yesterday prior to today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet made up of technocrats who are not members of Parliament.
Monty spoke about the importance of a programme involving many victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups participating in the discussions after meeting with the candidate for Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said that he would wait to see if Mario Monty would ask Parliament to vote for confidence before Friday to make sure the new government had sufficient support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monty presenting a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of the country, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on the nervousness of stock exchanges and bondholders yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, it takes time to prepare the government and the program, he stressed, adding that he is convinced that markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but concerns arose again, in particular after the sudden fall of industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister was to form a team comprising, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians”.
The new government would have to be in place until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive a vote of confidence from Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that when he took office, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important actor in Europe.
European Commissioner Olly Rehn stressed that “in spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not implement the 2013 budget, despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, had demanded, inter alia, new stringent measures.
The Italian boss boss boss, Emma Marchegaly, who will meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on restarting the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters."
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence as the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented the “era shift” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, “professor”, symbolizing “the challenge of gravity” and “the other Italy”, according to the authors of the editorials.
The great unknown is the durability of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid an early election, as by April 2012 Italy would have to pay 200 million euros in public debt.
A Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Russian scholar Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons confirmed Monday the American Agency specializing in nuclear danger.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran's nuclear programme
According to ISIS, relying largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked 30 years, "starting in the 1960s, at the Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by means of explosives."
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to establish a company producing nanoalms in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then collaborated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, pending his return to Russia
In its report, IAEA refers to “clear indications that Iran's development of the nuclear detonator system” “facilitated the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technique well, but who also informed the agency that he had worked most of his career on this technology as part of his home country's military nuclear programme”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, between 2009 and 2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent, while other forms of racial and religious violence declined slightly or did not change during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4 per cent in attacks on Jews and an overall increase of 14 per cent in religious offences.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
After a decline in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is rising again, and Human Rights First, “an increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant”, adds the organization in an official communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as serious human rights violations," added Paul Lejandra, a leader of the organization.
"American government can and should do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police hate crime reports".
“Hate-related crime” in the federal law is the legacy of a period of struggle for civil rights.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and today's sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook
On Monday, Twitter's microblog site changed the presentation of its platform, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they are watching, which makes this service like Facebook.
The new "activity" and other "name" tab allows you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other Twitters, the Internet users whose messages (tweet) you are tracking, and those who are tracking yours.
This provides an opportunity to learn if they publish messages, if they sign new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "at a low percentage of users in August" before being released on a wide-area basis on Monday, and told AFP to press-secret Twitter Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which for a long time was known as intuitively rather obscure and as using rather vague terms (RT to repost someone else's communication, #fallowfriday to recommend tracking other users), mostly taking pleasure in experienced users, thus discovers itself to a wider audience, presenting users with something closer to popular social media Facebook and Google+.
On the Internet, users discussed this innovation through "tweet" on the Internet.
"It's useless, obsessive, and too much like Facebook".
Functional activity will help me better monitor certain elements of my Twitter stream, writing @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a “gold rule” budget in the Constitution
The leadership of the great coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided to write a budget “gold rule” in the constitution on Tuesday to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid possible downgrading of Austria's state credit rating by rating agencies (troika A).
Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann himself announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers meeting, with Austrian public debt at 74.6%, significantly higher than the upper threshold of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty but lower than the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay fell by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest of €3,000 million more each year, the argument of Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger of Christian Democrats.
Austria thus fulfils the Eurozone summit demand on 26 October in Brussels; the Heads of State and Government demanded a reduction in budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced government accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The Austrian Government's decision resembled the “German model”, since Germany was the first European country to adopt this “rule”.
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and since 2017 the structural deficit of the State budget of the federal State should not exceed 0.35% of GDP in any year, and land, like communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to make the public debt fall below the 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Yoshihiko Noda
threatens a new currency market intervention
Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would take further intervention in the currency market if the value of the yen continued to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the yen to be too volatile, explained Mr. Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen grew almost to a historical point that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has set a new force record since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown constantly, driven by the purchase of investors who perceive it as a haven in these troubled times of global economic collapse and Europe's debt crisis.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the level that caused the last intervention.
On the eve of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar cost about 120 yen and the euro over 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is detrimental to Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the income of Japanese firms from abroad when converted into a national currency.
"Japan fights to rebuild itself" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), stressed Mr. Noda, who feared that the yen's growth would kill the fragile embryo of recovery.
The world ' s third largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to increased exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect Japan's "fundamental economic performance".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Board on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy manager of Hiroheed Yamaguchi warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “relevant steps” to realize that no further mitigation was expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting in late October, the issuing organization increased by 5,000 million yen (€47,000 million) the purchase of treasury bonds, raising to 55,000 million yen (€519 million) the ceiling it allocates to the purchase of various financial instruments to fill the securities market.
Eurozone
Rates are rising, stock exchanges are fluctuating
The risk of debt crisis is undermined by European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in fragile countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges left this Tuesday, November 15, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 percent and finished bidding at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4 per cent and London by 0.1 per cent.
With the new difficulties of lending to eurozone countries in difficult circumstances, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"Concerned investors just worry too much about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker IG Markets, quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo exchange closed with a 0.7 per cent drop in new market doubts about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has set its eyes on Europe, and exchanges will follow each other in a corridor of narrow changes until investors have proof that the situation has stabilized," states Mitsushige Aquino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This return of concern about the future of the eurozone hits a single currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The Euro reached its lowest point in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, falling by 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, she fell after the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel HDZ on Monday, at which a resolution was adopted, providing, inter alia, for a country in difficult circumstances to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are well above 6%
The lending rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
This morning, Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the concerns of participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the exchange for time to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened with paralysis under the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be a "core objective" of his Government.
Spain was under fire from markets before the parliamentary election on Sunday.
The spread between interest rates on 10 years of debt between Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
Waiting for Eurozone growth figures
France recorded economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent, owing to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised downwards for the second quarter, with 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) falling instead of stagnant.
And economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts should prevail over the dogmas
If there is a topic on which a decision cannot be made after a brief discussion or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that election meetings are becoming an occasion to reflect on the share and location of nuclear power.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options have been explored.
France should base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
We are now 7,000 million people on the planet, and population development will entail doubling the need for electricity by 2050, unless a large part of the world's population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue producing electricity continuously, bearing in mind the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalances, a topic that has disappeared from environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident doesn't change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil are just a few of those who are resolutely pursuing their projects.
The United States decided to add one installation to its kit after Fukushima, resuming construction of the station, which was interrupted after the Tri Mile Island accident.
Although the German renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
Berlin's choice will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, an increase in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be visible.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European Turbine Championship, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind, causing carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices respectively to be 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher than Europe's average.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
As in a globalized economy, energy prices are key to competitiveness and to the maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any meaningful reduction in nuclear power will result in a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illusory statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts an array of specialized international trade-oriented small and medium-sized enterprises and generates many jobs that cannot be moved to another industry.
If France decided to give up nuclear power, it would have to donate a large number of these facilities and lose 6,000 million euros a year to French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electric engineer would order an EPR calculated to run for sixty years if the manufacturer was scheduled to close down?
To solve the energy equation, it must be recognized that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy generation.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions by Areva demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of safety is undoubtedly a vital issue for nuclear energy
In France, we have a security body that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres, such as Flemishville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are filled with the same obsession with security.
The nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents over the course of 50 years.
Only one, Tri Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any effect on humans or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the reactor's device and unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented power that caused tens of thousands of deaths.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident, as it has learned from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the collaboration between security agencies, operators, and French and German designers, EPR, presents a project to counter such phenomena.
As it is considered by all energy experts who wish to build the reactor, the stop in Flemishville will be a magnificent gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF, clearing the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best mix of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a benefit to the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized on various sides - the overloading of police, judicial and administrative services subordinated to the policy of numbers and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a “human rights State”.
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which came into the news when the Minister of the Interior (Liberación of 23 May) stated that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waiters".
But it is very rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is much agreement between the right and the left on this issue.
The right-wing tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 stated that “900,000 unemployed will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers” and by Michel Rocar, on the left, who explained in 1990 that France “can't accept the poor from all over the world”.
The only difference is in the level of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of an invasion of the country by a Polish plumber was felt by both the left and right.
Both sides see the burden of immigration on the French economy and on French society.
The only difference is the level of generosity that they would be willing to show to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande limited himself to the banality of saying that “joint work will solve our immigration problem”.
This perception of immigration as a burden and a problem may offer an electoral advantage, but it is economically costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book summarizing recent immigration data (Special People: How Migration Formed Our World and Defined Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among professionals about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that accept immigrants.
Limiting immigration reduces growth and reduces employment.
Fear of the influence of immigrants is based on the notion that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled workers, by triggering wage declines.
But experience has shown that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than replacing local labour with jobs that lack local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job offers.
Positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between local and immigrant workers leads to a positive effect on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows results in an increase of 0.6-0.9% in real long-term wages.
This is without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (among the United States Nobel Prize winners is a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make a net profit in social security systems, accounting for an average of 1 per cent of the total budgets of European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates that, for example, in Germany, an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will generate a net return (income minus expenditure) on average of 150,000 euros in his or her life.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of her mandate, was about to get "tooths" into the missing growth points.
These teeth, which were used to deter immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remains to reflect on European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that, by inventing it in Athens more than 2,000 years ago, in the twentieth century it experienced the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some believed that it was enough to have democracy finally triumph over its enemies to have a vote and make it as direct as possible.
It's been known since Napoleon the Little One that it comes from the superficiality of thinking.
Universal suffrage, although a prerequisite for democracy, is not sufficient and may even become a "tool of suppression", as was once said by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vashro.
No, democracy requires many other things - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of power, education, Education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palinodia of the true-living Greek referendum would have a double exposure effect, demonstrating both the need for serious policy changes and the unpleasant sense of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now moved and, in the view of many, Republican soldiers are now targeting the wrong direction.
We will not win anything by requiring a series of national referendums organized as needed and in a chaotic manner.
Cart Blanche for an absolute European monarch or a jump with bound legs into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of a guillotine blade, but of implementing -- jointly, clearly and continuously -- choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many more will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis: the crisis of Europe.
Europe as a whole is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
All of Europe is completely humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
There is an urgent need to return the governance of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because it is only by working together that Europeans can reduce the burden of everyone's debt, free themselves from markets, and prepare themselves for the future by investing in it.
Recovering from the crisis will require decisions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by Socialists and Jacques Delorre, everything now demands a European economic government.
Let's do it.
But to imagine it without the stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has taken place in our country is yet another madness and a new impasse.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" the Republicans.
A revolution of interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a Europe united on an economic level.
This can be done only through the creation of a more democratic Europe at the political level, a genuine people ' s European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are spreading more widely.
The World Chip Card Exhibition opens Tuesday in Wilpent under Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011 will end with 11% growth in world microprocessor sales (bank cards, SIM phones), exceeding 6,000 million units according to Eurosmart.
Most important is the non-contact technology sector, which allows for the payment of public transportation or purchases by simply mapping the reader.
This year, 460 million uncontacted chip cards will be sold in the world, up from 320 million this year!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) to almost 10 per cent of the world chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, long behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of non-contact payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this function and are hosted by 75,000 terminals.
France starts with a more modest position: 400,000 uncontacted Visa cards are in circulation.
But the big shops are getting faster.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontacted Pass MasterCard.
To move to higher speed, banks need to provide equipment to their clients.
"Two large organizations in France promised in the future to systematically distribute bank cards adapted for non-contact use to their customers," reported Gerard Nebuyi, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments with a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage in the development of a future payment tool, that is, a mobile phone.
So far, few machines are equipped with NFC (Counter Field Communication) technology necessary to perform such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they should really fly next year."
"We count on world sales of between 80 and 120 million units in 2012, explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday Crédit Agricole announced the experiment from December to June of the following year in Qana.
The iPhone apps will be provided with cover for approximately 200 clients and staff members providing non-contact payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also stated yesterday that he was preparing to market a proposal that would allow his clients to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front spreads from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links of the Islamic Maghreb with the Boko Haram sect.
The long-sought links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that the Algerians were now confident.
"The means used by these two organizations and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating," he explained without going into detail.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
An investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in the Niger in January revealed two links.
Abducted at a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocourt and Vincent Delorie were apparently killed the next day, along with several of the kidnappers, during an operation conducted by French special units.
Among the debris left over from the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone sim cards belonging to terrorists.
Axis of terror
An analysis of the calls made indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one indicates a Nigerian who lived long in Maidiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other a man allegedly close to Aqmi and a sect.
"This is a step forward, but surely we have to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for many years that the sect receives financial and imaginative support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian explorer.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in Boko Haram's actions and statements and in its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, is now exerting pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of enlightened people who are not of interest.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri at the mosque, school and Imam Foundationist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is sin" - preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict observance of the sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the wicked central government.
It targets mainly churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuji's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left behind 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect radicalizes and goes beyond its northern loins.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an action that killed 80 people in Jos, and then for another in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram organized the first suicide attack on a strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria in Somalia, is now a concern for all security experts.
Today, with Aqmi strengthened in Mali and Niger, and Somalis from Al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during an interview with Presidents Goodluck, Jonathan Alain Juppe warned of the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his readiness to share all available information.
The world as seen by Republican presidential candidates
With regard to China, Iran, and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can a crisis-impaired America lead a complex world with simple, or more precisely, simplistic ideas?
If you heard Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe it.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry, and others have multiplied loud but lacking details of the foreign policy statement, which is traditionally a strong side of the Republicans.
Lozungs about, China, Iran, and aid to Israel are often mixed with one another.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of being promoted by the Old Good Party, threatened to file a complaint with the WTO against the Chinese and accuse them of "manipulating their currency is a sensitive subject for America, irritated by the migration of entire industries into Asia.
Worse still, if it led to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China, and the only candidate who understands complex foreign policy, failed to resist a position that indulges in emotion.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who's holding at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard.
Reagan-style.
Romney also promised military strikes against Iran if sanctions could not stop his nuclear program.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran, he'll tell me."
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to honour his promises to that partner.
Businessman Herman Kane, second in the candidates' ranking, demonstrated a discouraging ignorance of cases.
He recently called for a response to the Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power – obviously not knowing that China has already had it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes against Iran, says he is ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The torture of terrorist suspects banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Kane, Perry, and candidate Michelle Bachman.
All of this is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, the heavyweight of foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he had won the cold war.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to reduce the tone of the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the premature withdrawal of “kids” from Iraq, and on his ploys in Libya, which have given him a reputation as a weak politician.
But the offensive isn't that easy.
The population believes the national security balance under Obama, which eliminated Ben-Laden, is positive.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that are stuck in the sand.
And, arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
North Stream, new gates for the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The Northern pipeline connecting Western Europe and Russia directly along the Baltic Sea seabed has been launched.
It is designed to provide gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas manufacturer, wanted to celebrate this pompous event.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday on the banks of the Baltics, between the orchestra's performance and exquisite snacks, in the opening of the Northern Flow, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fiona and his Dutch colleague Mart Rütte together turned the symbolic valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new pipeline will receive 27,500 million additional cubic metres of gas each year in Western Europe through the first 1,224 km long pipeline connecting Leningrad Oblast to Meklenburg-Pomerania land.
The second pipeline is due to be ready at the end of 2012, supplying a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to all French consumption.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already under discussion.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Flux will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passing through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power: they will become more difficult to influence Russia by threatening to shut down Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing the North Stoke with the new German-Soviet Pact, hinting at the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That means the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of supply.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between eastern and western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already at an end.
"This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it's a new artery that organically binds us," said François Fiona, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent big gas contracts are both politically and economically important.
This explains the broad smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
Submarine pipeline is made of steel put into concrete to protect it from anchors of ships.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
In order to build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left over from the Second World War.
"A hundred needed to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for the North Stoke Company.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect fauna and flora.
The pipe is a long metal snake with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel towers, without ruptures along its length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the Swedish area, but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not thrilled that a Russian state-owned company would permanently settle off its shores.
"In the event of an accident, we'll cut the gas flow in less than a minute," says Jens Mueller.
So in the event of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But it seems unlikely to designers who designed stitches designed to leak only once every 100,000 years.
The condition of the pipeline will be monitored by an underwater robot that pulls the ship for external observation, as well as by an apparatus that circulates inside the pipeline.
A cigar-shaped apparatus is injected into a pipeline 1 metre in diameter and pushed forward by a flow of gas.
Upon arrival after three full days of travel at a rate of 3 metres per second, he gives accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for any repairs.
The gas shall be Circulated only by its pressure.
It is 200 bars at departure and 100 bars at arrival.
Five companies joined forces to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9 percent each).
The five companies formed a joint venture called the Northern Potok, which was tasked with constructing and operating a pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Tsuga in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for full volume no matter how much gas is actually transported," Jens Müller claims.
The pipeline was financed by 30 per cent by shareholders and 70 per cent by bank loans.
The total cost of the work would be €7.4 million for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investment will be about 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay their costs because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The pipeline exits the Baltic Sea in Lubmin to the sandy shore planted by conifers.
Valves 4.5 metres high form an exit gas terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 it will be 6 million.
Moleskine brand notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company fifteen years ago, will restore the taste of the letter.
He has the scent of adventures, hours spent behind a letter in the candlelight.
Moleskine's notebook is easy to learn on a rectangular black cover, on a rubber, on yellowish-white pages, as if yellowed over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to market designer notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's then consultant, took responsibility for launching a new product.
The notebook is inspired by old manufacturing techniques, Moleskin - lacquer cotton fabric used, for example, to cover benches.
This type of notebook is said to be highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought into line with today's taste an old and forgotten thing that was cultable to avant-garde artists until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the manager of the brand in Modo Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent to 12.7 million.
We've gone a long way from producing the first years when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine crossed Italy's borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Setting the profile of a typical customer is hard because the notebook equally attracts a businessman, a student, and a man of free occupation.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, have broad views and are educated.
A small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in Fnac bookstores, shops in the centers of small cities, and has been able to gain widespread visibility.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter despite the advent of e-mail," explained Maria Sebregondi.
This distinctive cultural feature is a complement to the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized an exhibition called "The Eyeway", where architects and artists showed their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched covers with a leopard drawing for the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of his successes and cultural aura, Moleskine diversified his products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags.
Success, which gave rise to envy: In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the SG Capital Europe Investment Foundation, now Syntegra Capital, which wrote a new page in Moleskine history.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19 per cent of the disabled are looking for work.
The 15th Week of Employment of Disabled Persons begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19 per cent, compared with 9 per cent for the general population.
Disappointing?
"No," stresses Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes a week of employment for the disabled."
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made".
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not 2 but 3 times higher".
"But there's still a lot of work to be done."
It must be said that there are still many obstacles to employment for a disabled person.
Of these, 37 per cent are older than 50 years of age (17 per cent on average).
Rather, they have low qualifications: 80 per cent have no bachelor ' s degree, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very common, at 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to get back to work and which are at the heart of the problem," says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire a disabled worker.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about a mentality that changes, but it's too slow.
A study by IMS-Entreprendre in April commissioned by Cité found that interviewed managers had a low level of knowledge about disability and "presented whole people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally disabled."
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of 6 per cent of disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The latest known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"Today we're about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiff, an organization responsible for collecting tax from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “taxable” organizations, like the amounts paid, declined from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law that raised the tax created strong pressure on the companies, explains Pierre Blanc".
"But this improvement also reflects an increase in consciousness, particularly in large enterprises".
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent with 100 to 199 employees.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before fighting Shini on Tuesday night (20.45 a.m.), Eden Azar and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they had received from this friendly match.
We won't get to the point that there was a conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to the podium of the Stadium de France arena, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months after the act of his attacker in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to go on," says player Lille.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the team, it's one whole, he justifies himself.
"In Lille, I'm year-round, and in Belgium I'm not".
"I have to make points."
Left in reserve, in the run-up to this match with France, in a game against Romania Friday night, Azar came to Saint-Denis to finally "bless".
Without forgetting, however, the notion of pleasure.
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the special nature of this match.
And especially that on the other side is Mathieu (Debushi), Johan (Cabe) and Adil (Rami), he recalls.
"Just our roads crossed".
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens fondly remembered "hoardiness."
"Pride" to play in "a holiday match."
"Pride" is also to claim, as a "cosed", that France "again became a very high-level team" just a year after the injury in Naise.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunder strike, admires him.
Now that Belgium has missed the next Euro, the tech athlete will fly in the same plane with the blues... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We build something, players ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will see that in future matches, including this one against France".
Portugal is very confident.
Portugal Paulo Bentu begins his retaliatory match against Bosnia (22.00 hours) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On his way, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Bentu already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt that the Team, which has been running since September 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal's only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a match to play and Bosnia to win.
With 0-0 on Friday in hell, it's clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the cherished goal that would calm it.
"This is a good result, which, however, entails a certain risk".
But in their own, at their brightly lit stadium de la Lus in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the public, which should be thrilled, although the match will be very stressful," said the optimistic but prudent Bentou.
"We expect a very intense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of going to the Euro 2012, the successor to Carlos Keiroš has said wrong.
A tie on Friday in a match against Bosnia requires the Portuguese to win.
No one could set up a Bosniac.
"It's a good result, which has some risk, however, - regrets Benta.
"We will play against a team with many technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the beginning, "no time to give them time to think."
It's a good idea, just this time it's real.
