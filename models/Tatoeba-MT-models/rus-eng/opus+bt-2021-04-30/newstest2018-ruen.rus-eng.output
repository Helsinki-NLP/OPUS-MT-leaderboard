Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law introducing administrative liability for violating the time and manner of payment for goods (work, services) in procurement for State and municipal needs.
The Act is intended to address the very acute problem of the failure of customers to comply with their obligations in public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, it was common for entrepreneurs to be unable to obtain payment under public and municipal contracts already executed.
At the same time, the President of the Russian Federation instructed the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not deal with the unfair customers who had entered into unfunded contracts, tried to evade their payment obligations and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in general in the country.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office has submitted 9,700 submissions, disciplinary proceedings have been brought against 4,500 officials, administrative proceedings have been instituted against 533 officials, and 75 cases have been submitted to investigative bodies for the purpose of conducting procedural checks, of which 46 have been prosecuted.
As a result, over 66 billion roubles were paid to entrepreneurs.
These huge amounts were not accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion-dollar contracts.
Unsound debts have been caused by numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs by far more modest amounts.
Here's a special case.
The head of a small company won a multi-million ruble social transport service contest.
The man invested all his working capital, fully discharged his obligations, but did not receive the money on time.
The result is an increasing financial pool of debts on wages, taxes and loans that would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought assistance from the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The problem has now been minimized in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt on State and municipal contracts identified by prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation amounted to about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical levels, the Office of the Public Prosecutor operates under a manual crisis management regime.
The Attorney-General conducts face-to-face meetings with local authorities, where all violations discovered by prosecutors are dealt with in a substantive manner and measures are taken to remedy them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already taken place this year in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of Federal Act No. 189-FZ amending the Code of Administrative Offences to establish the administrative liability of the officials of the customer for violating the time and procedure for paying for goods (work, services) in procurement to meet State and municipal needs, signed last week by the President of the Russian Federation, will be a qualitative improvement in the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Development of Russia on the initiative of the Office of the Procurator-General.
The new law would add an article to the Code of Administrative Offences, which provided for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 roubles for the violation by an official of the employer of the time limit and procedure for paying for goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he or she will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure that these legislative innovations are applied in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Unit has issued a travel warning in Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to colored people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The band's statement reads: "A warning for travellers of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on African American travellers, guests and citizens of the state of Missouri to be particularly attentive and to exercise heightened caution when travelling across the state in connection with a number of dubious racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and brought here."
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a recent Missouri law that made it more difficult for people to win claims of discrimination, and that State law enforcement agencies disproportionately target minority groups.
"You have human rights violations.
They are stopped on roads because of their colour, beaten and killed," told the Kansas City Star newspaper Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population of Missouri.
"We hear complaints often more often than ever."
This is the first warning of this kind declared by the organization to the U.S. state.
The group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while on a trip to the state, and Missouri State Police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report from the Missouri State Attorney General's Office, according to which the likelihood of being stopped on a black driver road is 75 percent higher than that of white drivers.
"The purpose of warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be trained in one way or another to take bail money with them or inform relatives that they travel through state territory".
According to the latest FBI hate crime reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes recorded in Missouri in 2015, making the state the sixteenth in the state by the number of such violations.
The travel notice is also a response to a new Missouri law, which will make it more difficult to bring a case against a legal person for housing or labour discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings to travellers in Texas and Arizona after these states passed new immigration control laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which ACLU believed should have increased the number of racial audits.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but in recent times public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Two people were killed in a shooting of a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown gunned down a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reports Reuters, citing the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
During the exchange of fire, two people, including one police officer, were killed and three people were injured.
All wounded have been taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the vehicle, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement.
One of the perpetrators was detained and the other managed to escape.
Rostourism supports the law on the elimination of free baggage for non-return airline tickets
The head of Rosturism, Oleg Safonov, stated in an interview with the RBC television channel that "positive" refers to the adoption of a law abolishing free baggage carriage on non-return airline tickets.
"There is a need to create conditions under which a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has baggage," he stressed (quota from TASS).
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that despite the fears of citizens, there would be no need to pay for the carriage of the upper clothing and the mobile phone in the hand baggage.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to say it, to say it's to the upper clothes, to the umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the iPad, or even to some computer, to have no relationship," said the head of Rosturism.
Russian President Vladimir Putin had previously signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the rule of free baggage carriage on non-refundable airline tickets.
This is because airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of baggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin has commissioned the elimination of pollution from Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting on the protection of Baikal, reported that in recent years large areas of the lake had been severely polluted.
It mandated the identification of funding sources, plans and actors to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin has also commissioned a full-scale remediation of contaminated areas.
"There is also a need to deal with objects that continue to work here, most of them are worn out," quotes the President's RIA News.
He also added that the Office of the Procurator-General of the Russian Federation should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area with the emergence of natural landfills and a number of environmental disturbances by recreational organizers.
"I want to emphasize this: not everything is checked in a row, there is also a measure to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities that need to be dealt with," he stressed.
The Office of the Attorney-General had previously reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of sites subject to environmental supervision.
Let us recall that on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, in a direct line, declared the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special protection regime.
He was informed of problems with his economic activities by the inhabitants of Olhon Island, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donska, immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but in the Buryatiya government it was recalled that such a change was not enough, as the restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Previously, the Ministry of Economic Affairs had proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the Law on Environmental Protection.
There will be a new temple in Yubrah
In the village of Sosiva, members of the community from the small indigenous peoples of the North “Rakhtiña”, together with residents of the Berezovsky district, are involved in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honour of Saint Nikolai Wondermaker.
Its location is a riverbank, the temple will be well visible from afar, so it will serve as a traveling beacon for fishermen.
According to community representatives, construction work will be completed this year, domes are now in place and church bells are available.
The Navy's Game REB provided a transport escort.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas Wondermaker as he is honored by the Orthodox Church as a patron of travellers, including fishermen.
In Sosyva, however, fishing provides the settlers with work, food, and food.
The locals wait for the temple to open its doors and the children even write about it in school essays as a local landmark.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why does Singapore respect the law?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an outdoor diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while the cigarette is carefully stored in an iron box seized from the office.
After the conversation is over, the businessman heads to the nearest urn - 100 meters before it - and throws the bulls in there.
A fine for garbage in a public place of $500 is reported by Chang.
You know, I've just had a reflex since I was a kid: you can't throw a candy fan on a bridge, they'll fine you instantly.
And now there's cameras all over the place.
Indeed, Singapore's sidewalks in the middle of the city are pure as if in a museum.
Chang tells us that three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?!
Imagine.
He was hit by a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
It's not uncommon for us to have corporal punishment.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and extremely harsh laws, the AiF columnist was on the spot.
No one here thinks of abolishing the death penalty, lawyer Victor Lee Hong explains.
And the government hasn't given a damn about the opinion of both the EU and the U.S. on this for a long time.
If a person transports or sells large quantities of drugs, he or she is hanged.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport, carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian Premier, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
But the guy ended up hanging anyway.
After that, our drug couriers travel the country with great care.
The point is that Singapore requires laws to be followed by everyone in a row, not just modest and poor people.
It doesn't matter who you are, a millionaire, a vice prime minister, a well-known artist or a member of the European Union.
There's only one option here: if you get a pound of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and you meet signs with a bunch of warnings, you're like, "How many bans in this city-state?"
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies and can be purchased strictly by prescription (!) of the doctor.
The tourist won't be taken away from the gum on arrival, but if you stick it in the subway, a fine of 1,000 local dollars will be paid.
In four days, I met two people with white signs around their neck, "I was trashing."
In addition to being fined, a cigarette is often sentenced to "link to the wipers" for a week to clean parks and beaches.
6,000 rubles are paid by the "criminal" who forgot to flush the water out of the public toilet, and when he tries to repair a small need in the elevator of a residential house, a special detector works - doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the very exotic laws are bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs, and even excessive watering of a room plant (!): It is believed that abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
To avoid fires, smokers can't carry lighters on the subway, otherwise they'll fine you 5,000 Singapore dollars.
So the idea is, whatever you try, you're gonna break something.
That's not true, he's trying to cross me with Mohammed Kabir-Kajariyah, the owner of the local travel agency.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I haven't seen anyone get involved for violating them.
Why do they stay?
So the citizens don't relax.
The basic rules are strictly enforced.
Let's say if a minor is sold cigarettes in the kiosk, everything will be punished along the chain: the shopkeeper will pay a huge sum, the intruder himself will get hit with sticks on the back part, and the seller will also be flogged and jailed.
It is because of such harsh laws that offences are very rare in Singapore.
Is that justified?
As early as the 1970s, we had road chaos, with motorists ignoring traffic lights, driving as they wished, driving drunks.
After the fines were imposed in a year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having a drink of whiskey, knows: if they stop, the police officer won't let go of the bribe, they'll pay a fine in the amount of the price of the apartment, and they'll send him to jail for years.
For many foreigners, the city-state in South-East Asia seems to be a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a guest from the United States horrified the common wealth of residents, "a frighteningly clean airport" and "cultural nature."
To say such things are unnatural, they look artificial, and that shouldn't be the case in principle.
First days in Singapore, and you're totally afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, and you're covered if you're in the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the Little India neighborhood, and then suddenly, "break the pattern," and there's plastic cups at the bus stop.
"What do you mean?" you wonder.
That's it, the Singaporeans laugh.
Things happen.
Not every crime like that will be caught on the spot, but you must know that if you're caught, you won't get away, because you broke the law.
More often than not, it's enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh City, I moved very carefully, with motorcyclists often taking smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
In the middle of Paris, there's a lot of dirty hobos and beggars.
Not everyone on our streets is trying to throw trash in the bins, either.
Singapore, on the other hand, has become the calmest, cleanest and safest city on earth, thanks to a set of dragon fines and ruthless laws (up to the death penalty).
You'll think about it.
That's human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one was wearing a seat belt until they were fined.
Although it was not fines that mattered in Singapore, it was voluntary law enforcement.
And I have to think that people in Russia would also like clean streets, no garbage in the subway, and they would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
That's corporal punishment, thank you, don't.
Otherwise, Singapore laws are worth looking at at at least.
Nothing sacred?
Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting statues.
Americans understand this as well as everyone else - hence the deliberate theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump government, knew no doubt what he was doing when he laid a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the President's proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't attempt the statue itself.
A bunch of pleasure ship owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried it.
But he attempted her meaning, and especially the meaning she was credited with in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when Emma Lazarus' poems were added to the pedestal.
How Miller grumbled at Akosta: "I don't want to go into this deep in history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines the world.
The poem you're talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was right about the facts, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
It's about the current sound of the striking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming of breathing freely, / The unhappy scum of your abundant shores."
Never before have "involved scum" been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature, he made it clear that Trump wasn't expecting these people in America.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to place her words on the castle of the statue after her death - knew very well that they were committing a completely political act.
The design sculpture was to mark the link between the French and American republics through a banal classical figure, the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The connection of the poem and image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right, though, changed it back.
The loud Rush Limbo, a kind of John the Baptizer who heralded Trump's arrival, in 2010 reasoned that Freedom did not invite anyone, rather she was an early neo-conservator carrying America's flame to the darkness of the world: "Freedom goes forward.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the United States."
Against Limbo's custom, it's really a point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would be seen exhausted, unhappy, but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
It means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a better life.
Its statue answers them with the words of hope and hospitality they desire to hear.
And, of course, this is not the prospect Miller and Trump will ever want to recognize.
Their torch is not needed to illuminate the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their power.
2017 World Championships: Neil Blake highly appreciates Scottish members of the UK team.
Eileed Doyle recalls the time when there were only two Scots in the UK
Neil Blake, director of the UK Athletics Federation's game, stated that a 16-member Scottish team at the World Cup would make a "significant contribution to the team's game".
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected for Friday's 2017 London Championships.
Blake believes that "something special is emerging" in Scotland, and the Athletics Federation of Great Britain should take that into account.
"We know that and we try to understand it and we will support it as long as they have potential," Blake said.
"I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's related to what they did.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that with what they've done, we have to work.
British Athletics Federation: With what they've done, we have to work.
And people on the street think the same thing.
I don't know why the circumstances are like this, but it's absolutely brilliant."
Some of the Scottish trackers claim medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 m; and Eileed Doyle chose the team as her captain.
"Aylid is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake says.
"Many trackers, whether Scottish or not, and where they live or train, came out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eileed put into her were wonderful."
The winner of the Commonwealth Championship silver medal, which will run 400 m with obstacles at its fifth World Championship, says 16 Scotsmen in the British team are "unbelievable."
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir, specializing in middle-distance racing and who broke five British and two European records last year, is on the way.
She'll run 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will be taking part in the 1500 m race, is another Scotsman to whom attention should be paid: behind his back, a successful season in which there were wins in the British qualifying competitions and the Annual Competitions.
Doyle recalls his first World Cup when, apart from her, Lee McConnell was the only Scotsman on the team.
The team captain says she is "unbelievably proud" that so many of her compatriots have not only joined the team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight to get out of the finals.
"Captain team picks other team members, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen is a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who joined the team.
This shows how much we've achieved.
And they're all trackers who'll try to get on the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Championships at home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from fans and take advantage of the fact that we're going to be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his arena and compete, and the atmosphere there will be just great."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't go to public office unless you're prepared to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Of course, his criticism was annoying.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "It's possible to take away the freedom of speech and lead us deaf and dumb to slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subordinates called the lawsuit null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "what and what."
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people will say.
But it's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He's an amazingly popular Republican governor in a state-dominated democracy.
He is second in the approval ranking among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan's not a stubborn reactionary.
He demonstrated a strong hand in state management and commitment to his principles.
He also cleverly uses Facebook as the primary way to communicate with his constituents and with jokes shows his bald head on his page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's page – which is claimed to be an official public forum and run by administration officials with taxpayer money – is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, spokesperson Amelia Ches defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments was just an upgrade.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spamers, and haters on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And these are the real people, not the trolls, the teacher, the businessman, the pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful, and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible as saying that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer Sarma Raman of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by his lack of reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comment section on the article in Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same subject, some people immediately say it's a so-called hookup instead of admitting they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens."
What governors subordinates call a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call an "active life stance."
In the Facebook era, it is easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than before when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical fronts, or arresting and silenced protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening now, only in the figure.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users, who were slammed on his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this subject was taken this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge from Alexandria James C. Kasheris, the Chairman of the Laudon County Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment by Banning the voter in her Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin has sued the American Civil Liberties Union for his behaviour on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
During the time of Washington, D.C., the era of affordable postal spending was about the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers increased fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters severely destroyed his authority.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the alias Juricola, Valerius, Belizarius, and Portius wrote letters to newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by George Washington's online paper project, his cabinet was overwhelmed by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech is at the very heart of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for household amenities at Renaissance
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for household amenities for the next three days, when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who led next door at Archerfield Links, and moved towards the final round last year until he lost to Paul Ils, attached to a new location and acts as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and director, Jerry Sarwady.
"I've seen the Renaissance club build, and we're watching it come to success with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this field at its best moment, it's in a magnificent state.
Jerry did a great job putting this place together.
He is a strong supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field."
Englishman Iles looks forward to the opportunity to defend the championship for the first time, despite having won both the European Challenge Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's really a special feeling," said a player from Southport.
"I failed to try again to win Extremadura Open, because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
It's magical to go back to this corner of the world.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
Memories of last year are coming back, and Sharon and I had a very special impression of winning last year.
It was a really special time, and we'll always remember it."
Returns to battle on Gary Orr's native land, joining the European Senior Sports Tournament after he was 50.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important," said Helensboro Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you feel this extra burden".
I was very happy to play again, and I did a good golf.
I'm happy with the way things are so far."
On the field, this trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnem and senior sports champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James, and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance – two of the six Scots on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldkorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuire, and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs £5 an hour if there's one person in the car, and £10 if there's two or more people.
All revenues go to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Types of tunnels above highways capable of absorbing carbon monoxide emitted by cars are already being tested on UK roads.
According to Autocar, the country's transport agency reported positive results from testing a 100-metre tunnel installed on a highway in the north of the country.
The 6-metre-high tunnel is built from some of the latest polymer materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the establishment of an entire network of such tunnels is only part of the massive measures that the British authorities are about to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the English are planning to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of road traffic reduction activities, expand the use of commercial electric propulsion and upgrade the heavy truck fleet.
According to official statistics, one quarter of all air pollution is caused by transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Moshorsud changed the punishment of the disabled Mamayev to a fine
Moshorsud changed the penalty for disabled Anton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years in the colony, to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
That's what TASS reports.
Previously, the Public Prosecutor's Office had asked the court to change its sentence to a conditional one, explaining that Mamayev's disease “prevents his finding in prison”.
Anton Mamaev, 28, was sentenced to four and a half years' imprisonment with a sentence in a general-security colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former SWAT fighter.
On 19 July, a court at a retreat in the SIZO released a man from detention.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Golden Land
When preparing lunch, Bardin Deguei doesn't use the stove.
She doesn't even use the pot much.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places sweet potatoes, which is called "nota", here, directly into the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is pulled out and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Deguei sits on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and it is here that she does her housework, such as washing clothes with cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof serves as a latrine.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, and that's why she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk around the village after five p.m.," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at the daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony that was joined to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote in public raising their hands in front of the occupying forces.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which retains strong control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarothali is as remote as an abandoned city; the road here includes an hour and a half flight from Jayapura, the capital of the province, to Nabira, and then a five-hour shake on a hired car.
There's no public transport here.
The town with a population of about 19,000 consists of wooden houses lined with bamboo fences; roofs of corrugated steel are painted with rust into a variety of reddish shades.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners, arrived here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, my pago was worshiped by a god named Uga Tamei.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't like to wear these clothes," Degei says, pointing at his bright, hand-clopped turban, dark skirt, and bright shirt.
"Formerly we wore only leaves on the body".
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 per cent of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a highland province about the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced around $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua can boast of forest reserves valued at $78 billion.
These wealths, however, entail one misfortune for the Pahuas, guaranteeing that Indonesia's powerful armed forces retain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation by The New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy by the Pahuas threaten the existence of this golden vein and are mercilessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, massacres in the high-lying indigenous peoples of Papua in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything”, a report published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane contains evidence of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture – particularly frequent, as stated in another report, rape and electrocution – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, researching in Indonesia for "Human Rights Watch".
The nuts have been prolonged as Papua's resources have attracted the influx of displaced persons from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5-millione population is 83 percent Christian, but the demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands – Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Javan shops, "varungi", sell fried chicken and a mixture of "gado-gado" vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to withstand competition.
"Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market at a cheaper price than Papua Natives," explains Abet Yo, a twenty-four-year-old Paniai native who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, due to work.
"Because of this, the indigenous Papuan mother (woman) Papuan people lost their market".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known in the people as Jokovi, vowed to address inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter secured support from 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But there has been little change in Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, expecting him to fulfil our hopes for justice," says Yo.
In fact, just two months after the inauguration of Jokovi Paniai in October, the tragedy survived.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas hymns at the bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle burst out of the dark.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one soldier resented their tone and returned with four soldiers some time later.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk chased the children and hit them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Yemo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A couple hours later, someone set fire to a nearby government election building, and the next day the situation worsened.
About a thousand Pahuasian men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed the White, a dance of the Papuas tribe of me pago: running in circles and depicting bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation escalated, soldiers were ordered by internal radio to "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," as it was said in an official document seen by the correspondents of TIME magazine but which was not published in the local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremias Kayamé, head of Kego Koto district in Enarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, asking the crowd to disperse.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, a bullet suddenly hit my left wrist," he told the magazine "TIME", standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayama still doesn't know who shot, but says the bullet came from the sherry of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were many shots," he adds.
A local resident of Alfius Yowa was hit three times, as his cousin told him, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," he grimly told the magazine "TIME" Johanes, who, like many Indonesians, only uses one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him".
General Yotje Mende, Papua Police Chief Inspector, told reporters that his officers were only "protecting" their base because she was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Papua Commissioner Pujo Sulistiyo, a police spokesman in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death".
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more injured.
The murder news didn't get to Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuse of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Viranto said he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately, the excuses came out.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the nineties or in the early zeros.
The point is, we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be done," he said.
Viranto then retracted his words, speaking with the magazine "TIME" on June 5, in Jakarta, and said he did not plan to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be decided through a court of law.”
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the bloody East Timor independence vote in 1999, said that 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims from Paniai met with such statements with a dark mistrust.
"I have been questioned four times over the last three years, but there has been no change at all," Johanes says.
"I'm tired".
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid I'll be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the view that Paniai residents were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came after me," he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the vicinity of Paniai District of Deiyai.
In a clash between villagers and the construction manager, who refused to help take the unconscious man to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dove, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the building site office belonging to the company.
According to the police, villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) started shooting at the crowd and killed one man.
"We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation," reported TIME magazine to twenty-nine-year-old Domingu Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being rushed.
"I've been hiding at my house for two days".
The Deiyai Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account and that the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is caused by discontent among the Mei, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the greened central highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Papua Free Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuas by launching sporadic attacks and raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the OPM's top leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kohiya.
As a response, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained by the military under the pretext of “protection of national independence”.
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua Paniai, it is considered "a sad, forgotten place".
Poverty exacerbates discontent.
A small amount of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is similarly unaffordable.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly a note, as well as some fruits and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten tubers worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic disparity between indigenous Papuas and new migrants who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabira airport has increased.
Few existing vacancies are usually obtained by better educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuas rarely have the money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village...because there's no job or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Esquiudi and Basil Longshan were deported from Papua for "inconsistency with relevant organizations" despite being given rare permissions to film.
According to Felim Keene, Deputy Director for Asia of Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Jockovi election campaign to lift media restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of media attention means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands – requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including shooting in Paniai.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arramanata Nasir, recaptured the group's statement, informing journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations."
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights Kiys Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the locals broke the silence, saying, "We want freedom," as claimed by the source, who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but the papais say they will not vote for Jokovi again.
"Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are mired in poverty, and their education and health care are in poor condition.
Gobai says that the Paniai residents, like the other Pahuas, consider their vote for Jokovi to be the duty he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the latest symbolic act of disobedience: burying the body of one of the victims on a plot of land just opposite a police and military station.
Knowing that justice is likely never to be realized, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Jacobus says, without raising his head.
"What else were we supposed to do?"
The fire covers the second time the Dubai skyscraper "Fakel"
The fire engulfed one of the world's highest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to rush out of the seventy-nine-story structure 337 metres tall.
This is the second fire to hit a high-rise building – a coincidence called "Fakel" – in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news of the cause of the fire.
"We slept and woke up from fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor," told Reuters a skyscraper called George.
According to the Dubai City Civil Defence Authority, fire brigades extinguished the fire at around 4 a.m. local time (00 a.m. Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide shelter to victims.
The incident may bring back the safety of materials used in exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world to the agenda.
In an investigation by the Fakel administration after the fire there in 2015, it was revealed that the most affected was the postering, the external panels used to shape and isolate.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the Grenfell Tower Building's isolation system and posters panels in London could have accelerated the spread of the June fire there, killing about 80 people.
The increase in tourist flows to Ida Viruma in June was minimal
According to data received by the correspondent of the rus.err.ee portal at the Department of Statistics, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists benefited from Northeast hotel facilities in June 2017, an increase of 125 or 0.6 per cent over the same period the year before.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has declined and the number of foreign tourists has increased.
Thus, foreign tourism increased by 7.3 per cent (544) in June to 7,994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent, from 12,944 to 12,525.
The largest increase in Russian tourists in the region was 8.9 per cent or 318 compared with June 2016.
In June 2017, a total of 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed at the Ida-Viruma hotels.
Andrei Malakhov gave his fans an understanding of who was responsible for his departure.
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans at Instagram who was responsible for his departure from Channel One.
So far, he hasn't commented on the rumours, but today he posted a piece of an August 1 newspaper article.
Malakhov's photo signed the boss milksucker tag.
An article on how to prevent the “burning” of an employee and to pay attention to his condition.
If you recall the numerous reports that the presenter was unable to find common ground with the newly arrived producer, who had decided to reformat "Let 'em speak," it is clear what he hinted so transparently, he writes "KP".
TV presenter Andrei Malakhov is reportedly on leave and has not signed the First Channel resignation application.
The situation of dismissal could be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five military personnel were killed in a car explosion
At least five soldiers died in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, transmitting RIA News.
According to police reports, a booby-trapped car exploded the night before the military roadblock in Girishk County.
We know about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new emergency occurred in Girika.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange counter.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver made a video of a shark biting his camera.
Diver and explorer Greg Skomal captured a shark who bit his GoPro action camera on video.
The video posted on Facebook a unit of the American Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, of which Scomal is a staff member.
The incident occurred on 2 August off the coast of Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeast of the United States, clarifying the Necn portal.
The man tried to film the shark on a special stick during the underwater voyage.
After observing the man, an animal more than three metres in length swam to him.
The shark began to bite the camera without attempting to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the predator did so to determine if the gadget was eaten.
The explorer added that the shark could easily destroy the instrument.
He also observed that such behavior by a marine animal was new to scientists.
The cause of the mass fight in the Ural military centre became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military Region had arrived at the Jelan Training Centre, where there had been a massive fight, to investigate the incident.
Some details of this beating have already come to light.
According to the Mash public appearing on the Vkontakte page, the Ural military unit's contract number 31612 had a violent fight over an untied bed.
It all started with a private man named Saiyan blatantly ignoring an officer's order to fill up a stuck sheet.
Members of the sixth company sided with the officer.
Saiyana supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young guys were vandalized in the barracks by beds and sinks, broken out windows.
More than ten people were injured in a mass fight.
The CVC denied the stabbing information.
The study revealed that at least one fifth of passengers in the United States carry prohibited items into the plane.
The study revealed that more than 20 per cent of air passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items, including at least 6 per cent boarded the aircraft with prohibited knives or other sharp objects, on board the aircraft at the United States Transportation Security Administration inspection points.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters charter company, Inc. and reaching over 1,000 people also showed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with something banned by the ATB, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent of the members of Generation X.
Intensely past ATB staff, food and water are most often carried.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had specially carried sharp objects through the search, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs on the plane.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had been accidentally smuggled through airport searches and how many had done so knowingly.
It is quite expected that most often, consciously or unconsciously, smuggling is carried through search by those who fly the most.
According to the company, the ATB rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often don't know exactly what kind of fluids they can carry and in what amount.
It is therefore not surprising that most of what the ATB takes are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that the ATB might be considered banned from carrying a book.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Chapter EPA Pruitt abandons his intention to postpone Obama regulations on emission reduction
The day after the 15 state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled his decision to postpone Obama regulations to reduce emissions of air pollutants and smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by saying that his agency now listens more to the needs of state environmental regulators than in previous administrations.
He did not mention a lawsuit against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute revolved around the deadline of 1 October, by which the states must meet the 2015 ozone standards at the land level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would defer compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid “inconsistency with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, who prior to being appointed by President Trump to his current position, was the Attorney General of Oklahoma State, was long known as a consistent opponent of the tightening of environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the imposition of regulations that were opposed by the chemical or gas oil industry.
The sudden change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of Pewitt's return to previous standards.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, by drastically changing the course of the ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the EPA's obligation to work with the states in an integrated process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"Under previous EPA administrations, it was often impossible to meet the target dates, then waited for claims from groups of activists and others and discussed the time frames during the settlement of the case," Pruitt said, who filed more than a dozen claims against EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our statutes and the authority that he confers upon us."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may, at some point, use his "authority to delay and other statutory powers" again to ensure that the "jcyjdfys" rules are clear-cut and on all available information.
Republicans in Congress insist on a broader revision of the ozone rules.
The bill, which was approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay compliance with the 2015 regulations for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
"Altering the course of the EPA - after our lawsuits - is an important victory in the fight for health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who have been directly affected by the power that surrounds their cities," Schneiderman said.
The New York lawsuit was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaver, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, D.C.
Ozone at the ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The result could cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people, causing thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health advocates and environmentalists welcomed Pruitt's unexpected change of course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the man who's supposed to protect the air we breathe," said Laurie Ann Bird of the Biodiversity Center.
"We must continue to resist the Trump administration's ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
The IAAF Congress extended the removal of the All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (WFLA).
In this way, Congress supported the IAAF's WFLA Reconstruction Board, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension be upheld.
166 people voted in favour of the extension, 21 against, and transfers the TASS.
The IAAF board report stated that the WFLA had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the re-establishment board, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the WFLA's disqualification at the London World Cup, Russian trackers were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the first IAAF.
WFLA was permanently disqualified by IAAF in 2015.
At that time, the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was published, highlighting numerous WADA violations committed by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the IAAF Board's latest report, read IAAF's "IAAF extended the WFLA sanctions".
A Disadvantaged Loss
In the framework of the 3rd round of the Fonbet First of Russia, the newo-Skova "Himik" teams played a retreat against FC Kaluga.
Just over 10 days ago, rivals played among themselves in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was quite different.
The Chemist did not give up anything to the opponent, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to a hurtful goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the caludans with a score of 0–3 many have pre-empted an easy victory of the masters.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the Novices had forced themselves to be considered and acted against defence, but from a position of force.
In the 1st half, the kalugans were more built and had an advantage in owning the ball.
Another very good match was played by Alexey Sirotin, who reflected the dangerous blows several times and gave confidence to the partners through his actions.
Unfortunately, the Chemical attack lacked the effort and the luck to put the Kaluga's defenses at an impasse and to score the first goal on the way out.
After the break, the game began to run in the oncoming courses.
The Newcomers were more active in the attack.
An alarming call for our team was a defence error that allowed the kalugans to create a number of hot spots.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemical intercepted the territorial advantage and conducted several dangerous attacks.
But the Kalujan experience played its part - they spent the ending more intelligently and in cold blood, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the Chemist moved the ball to the corner, which the field owners were forced to send without resistance to the gate.
The goal was authored by Yuri Dubrovin.
In the report meeting, the Chemist demonstrated a good game, but suffered a hurtful defeat.
Our team is waiting for another exit on August 11, at 7 p.m. in Moscow, at the Torpedo Stadium of Eduard Arrowsov, the Newcomers will fight the favorite of the Centre FC Ararat group, which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izamylov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support the Chemist!
The place and time of the meeting of the Novices - 6.30 p.m. near the store Magnolia (East, D.2, Corp. v.

According to published phone transcripts, Trump was pressing Mexico about paying for the wall at the border.
The Washington Post published transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nyeta Trump insisted that he stop publicly claiming that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The President of the United States has berated him for publicly speaking against the wall, and according to leaked information, told him, "You cannot say this to the press."
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
In a published transcript of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a heated altercation was also revealed.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US should receive refugees going to Australia was "funny", "disgusting" and "stupid", and insisted that due to the agreement concluded by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot as he intended to stop the resettlement of refugees to the US.
Trump concluded the conversation by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation of the entire day."
The bodies of the dead in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to Petersburg
The aircraft belonging to Russia, which carries the bodies of Russian women killed in Abkhazia, left Moscow time at 8:15 p.m. from Sochi to St. Petersburg, transfers TASS.
At the site of the final point of passage, members of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city's mayor's office, will meet with journalists from the Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia, Astamyr Ahba.
Representatives of the MES of the Republic had previously stated that all costs associated with bringing the bodies back to Russia had been borne by the Abkhaz Government.
In addition, the official Sukhumi intends to compensate the families of the deceased in the amount of 500,000 roubles.
According to Akhba, the Abkhaz leadership expressed its willingness to pay the relatives of the tourist victims to fly and reside in the Republic, but the relatives sent only power of attorney to the Republic to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On 2 August, at about 16:20 Moscow time, two explosions broke out in the village of Primorsk, Gudautsk district, at the missile and artillery depot of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic, followed by the detonation of the large-calibre shells and other ammunition stored there.
As a result, a storage facility was set on fire, causing uncontrolled blasts of shells of various modifications.
Two Russian citizens, Elena Polakov, were born in 1970, and Elena Timothy, born in 1962, were on vacation near a hydrogen sulfur source.
Sixty-four people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying degrees of gravity were taken to the Republic ' s medical facilities.
There are currently seven persons in the hospital and the rest are discharged.
The Russian influence on the American election will be studied by a grand jury.
The Russian Special Prosecutor, Robert Muller, has convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., who will study Russia's influence on the 2016 US presidential election, reports The Wall Street Journal and the Reuters agency.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to interview witnesses under oath.
The collected material will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether it is sufficient to bring charges.
The grand jury's call gives Müller additional powers to gather evidence.
One of the topics of the jury's investigation, which began a few weeks ago, will be the details of the son's meeting then-Presidential candidate Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnica.
Müller himself had previously promised to check the details of that meeting, held in June 2016.
They've already been investigated by the FBI.
In late July, Donald Trump Jr. was reported to have expanded his legal staff.
Trump Jr. had previously said that he had been waiting for compromise on the headquarters of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but no exposed documents had been submitted, and it was eventually about adoption.
In early August, information appeared in a number of media outlets that Trump Jr.'s announcement of meeting with Vesselnica was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House explained that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority as any father would have done.
Vice Mayor Penza was detained at work.
The deputy chief of administration of Penza Irina Shirshin is detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigation Committee at his workplace, reports RIA Newstoy.
No official reports have yet been received from the law enforcement authorities on this matter, but the UK SC's Press Service has assured them that they will follow soon.
There's no comment at the Penza City Hall yet.
Irina Shirshin is one of the five vice-presidents of the Penza administration.
She has been in charge of urban issues and land relations, assuming this position since April 2015.
Prior to that, she had worked for a long time as head of the State Department of the Penzen Region Inspectorate.
Irina Shirshina raises three minor children, it is remarkable that once again as a mother a year ago, she gave up maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no launch vehicle or launch vehicle in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bust is a tribute to the first person who's ever been in space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period that are demolished in some countries, the Gagarin monuments, on the contrary, are "walking the planet".
In 2012, a monument was erected in American Houston near former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument at the Royal Observatory was erected to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in Erfoot, where our astronaut visited in 1963.
The memorial in Karlov Wars, Czech Republic, avoided demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from downtown to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin, a monument to Yurius Gagarinsu appeared in Riga.
That's the name of the first astronaut in Latin, and he looks like he's 70 years old.
Morse Ford murder: activists will lose Lynch courts on stage to call for justice
The 1948 Ford Mercury drove past spectators in Monroe village in Georgia and rushed with a roar to the small Morse Ford Bridge.
When the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, came to the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The main one, a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip, pulled a cigar and looked through the windshield.
Sitting inside shivered for fear.
"We need that nigga, Roger!" a man squirted.
"Get him out of the car!"
The piercing cries broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that took place on July 22 is just a mocking.
But when Roger's neck was slammed with a loop, almost all the viewers really held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night that the Cooksklanians lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that no man has been arrested in all these years - although we see them beside us; although we know who they are," Tyrone Brooks says, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our story and it's a stone on our souls."
The 71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Congress of Georgia who has spent his entire life fighting for human rights.
To him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to Monroe residents that injustice has never been corrected.
"We want investigation, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
The Coroner covers the sheet body of one of the victims of the lynching at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI material received by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of involvement in the lynching.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well aware of two related motives of vigilantes: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens for the first time to vote on the primary, which was to take place that summer.
Around the same election, the FBI reports that black exploiter Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, with a woman in a fight.
Brooks says that according to rumours around town, Hester was sleeping with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was supposed to have was not from her husband.
According to FBI reports, on July 25, 1946, Loi Harrison, a major white landowner, paid $600 in bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of prison and drove up to the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded Harrison's murders," that's the conclusion in an FBI report.
"It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between state and city law enforcement agencies that not only took part in the murders, but also destroyed evidence and concealed witnesses' identities."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt on voting rights," he says.
"They were all killed to send a signal to blacks in town: if you register and vote, you'll be the same."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has been running an annual play reproducing that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visible, he captures the audience and tells of the deep racism that many would like to think is no longer in America.
It's hard to look at and even harder to turn around, but Green thinks that's what matters.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals of this year began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - gathered in the room and listened to a slit-down view of the play over the years.
Wade Marbo was the director with Green.
He has played the role of chief member of the clan for several years, but says the role has never been made easier.
"I think I'm dirty because it's not the man I am," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at the time."
In the room, actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
Spectal begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Screams Rascon back.
There's a blow.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all the black actors) is hoisted.
Green laughs loudest.
"What's up," asks Ascon.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I overplaying?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think the whites used to say 'nigg'."
"Yes, yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You have to pronounce solid 'r'".
And there's also a change in the energy in the room: the discomfort is replaced by a sense of partnership.
Everything must be done right, not only for the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the word "n", it's clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The show ends cruelly and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of actors and performs Billy Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
A hundred yards away, half the audience wipes out tears and sweat.
There are almost equal numbers of black and white viewers.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York to watch the performance; many live close by.
They all endured Georgia's heavy perfume for almost eight hours while Brooks took them on a pilgrimage to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until then, the murders remained only a story, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynched, it seems that their ghosts are floating in the air.
When the last note of the song closes, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend to their heads, touch blood paint, and still bodies, and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy mumbles like he's reminding himself of that.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it's over.
Actors drop ropes off their necks and wipe out tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, a man in a suit who played the main puppet.
Nick Rascona hugs the other two actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional burden of the play finally hit him.
"It's all right," one of the women whispers.
"We know your heart is good.
You had a reason for that."
Later, the audience sits down for dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta livelyly discuss the performance with the black couple they just met.
Denisa Daplinski has difficulty finding words to describe how she feels after the play.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, horrible words, and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think lynchings are still happening," she adds, "only now it's called the police shooting."
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, gained general attention.
He says he's already started planning next year's performance.
"The production inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it could happen again.
Those who do not study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
The court fined Navalny for violations on the "agitation Saturday night"
The Simonov Court of Moscow fined Alexey Navalny 300,000 roubles for disrupting the organization of the rally.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence under article 20.2, paragraph 8, of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, “Re-introduction of the organization of the meeting”.
Formerly, Judge Khyzyr Moussakayev of the Simonov Court of Moscow ended the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the Chief of Staff of Opposition, Alexey Navalny, who was prosecuted under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Moussakaev assessed the distribution of leaflets on the “agitational Saturday night”, which Navalny's supporters held in Moscow on 8 and 9 July.
After seeing the campaign materials, the police considered that the organizers of the event had deliberately concealed its true nature, a public action (for which permission had to be sought in advance from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuyev requested the administrative proceedings to be discontinued due to the absence of the offence and pointed out that the police had made some mistakes in drafting the protocol.
Volkov was not detained at the "agitive Saturday night" itself, but he received a summons to appear at the police station to report on an event he had actively participated in.
Navalny himself and another opponent, Nikolai Lyaskin, received the same summons.
Mordova's got his fiancée shot and three wedding guests arrested.
A court in Mordova arrested a local resident who shot four people, including the bride, at the wedding.
This was reported to the Republican Office of the Investigation Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of 29 July.
During the fight, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot several times at the guests of the event, coming to the village pond to bathe.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted under article 213, paragraph 1 (a), of the Criminal Code, article 30, paragraph 3, and article 105, paragraph 2 (a), of the Criminal Code, paragraph 2 (An attempt to kill two or more persons in a generally dangerous manner, with hooliganist motives).
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because the wedding guests, having decided to bathe, walked through the area of his site to the watershed.
Minergo will tighten requirements for power plant turbine suppliers
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the regulations for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, hydroelectric turbines, oil-spilling facilities and oil production are launched, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share access data with Minenergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft government decree is ready and submitted to the public for discussion.
The new requirements will apply only to “critical energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
The document identified potential threats such as obtaining information and access to the management of the facility by foreign intelligence agencies, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
The European Union has expanded anti-Russian sanctions due to Siemens
The EU Press Service announced on August 4 that anti-Russian sanctions had been expanded due to the scandal surrounding the Siemens turbines in Crimea.
This has previously been reported by the Arguments of the Week.
The EU Council Press Service stated that sanctions against the Russian Federation had been expanded due to the Siemens turbine scandal, which had allegedly been taken to Crimea in circumvention of the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
It had previously been reported that the final decision would be taken before the end of the day, and it had been decided that the sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the British educational group of Pearson companies announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of the provisional dividends by 72 per cent in conjunction with the start of another restructuring programme aimed at addressing the problems their business faces.
These job cuts, which, according to John Fallon's head of company, will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, occur in addition to the 4,000 jobs reduced under the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it planned to cut spending by another £300 million ($394 million) in May during the third cost reduction program to try to bring back a business that was hit by a rapid transition to digital learning methods.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share of Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1% increase in sales of the main commodity in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, as stated in a NATO report.
According to unverified local sources, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the Karabakh city area.
This explosion, the last one that struck Afghanistan this month, killed more than 30 people in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
NATO reports that an explosion that occurred on Thursday evening occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a "human-borne improvised explosive device".
All wounded are reported to be in stable condition and receiving treatment at the American military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Respondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is the main source of concern for NATO forces stationed nearby in Bagram.
According to UN reports, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, and about 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bombing in a car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban stated that they had launched the attack.
On 31 May, a powerful explosion killed more than 150 people in the centre of the city – the country's most serious human casualties since the Taliban was removed from power in 2001 under the leadership of the United States.
Violence highlights the insecure environment in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses whether there is a need to increase the number of U.S. military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency, after legal action, reverses the decision to postpone the adoption of the air pollution law
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama-era law, which required states to limit air pollution emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency because of this move.
On the evening of Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone measurements 2015", emphasizing that this step demonstrated the agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with and responsiveness to our state partners," said the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to defer ozone measurements, where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where to reduce it to meet stricter air purity standards by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, joined the Federal District of Columbia in a lawsuit alleging that this intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader programme aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has provoked resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large-scale emissions on public health.
The website of the Environmental Protection Agency states that the use of air for breathing with ozone "may worsen lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
The European Business Association opposed new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with the US economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new course of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
The deputies are asking the police to restrict traffic on the waterfront in Pskov.
Pskov People's Electors sent an appeal to the Chief of the UMD for the city of Sergei Surin on the problem of movement along the Great Water River.
The deputies of the proud Constantine Bolotin, Grigory of the Venetian and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, the control of drivers would help to make the area safer and safer.
The problem is that violators ignore the signs of the Walkway and ride freely along the waterfront.
Thus, major repairs and improvements have been wasted.
Sports and children's playgrounds are getting uncomfortable because of cars.
As noted by the Pskov Information Agency, the central waterfront is patrolled in the evenings by PPP Motopatro and friends.
As a result, the number of vehicles travelling is reduced, but the traffic is not stopped completely.
Putin asked the investigating authorities not to seize hard drives.
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to ban investigative bodies from removing servers and hard drives from work computers in enterprises.
This was stated by the Head of State at a meeting on investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, “the use of measures leading to the suspension of business activities, including the removal of hard drives from work computers and servers, should be excluded for the purposes of investigation”.
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is sufficient to make copies, assure them, and use them in the course of the investigation."
The Head of State added that “it is not possible to create conditions that prevent the enterprise from continuing to operate until taxes cannot be paid”.
Olga Busova told me how much she wanted to call her ex-husband.
TV host Olga Busova admitted that she was very anxious to call former footballer Dmitri Tarasov.
At present, the celebrity is in the United States, where he deals with working matters.
Just the day before Olga visited Las Vegas, after which she decided to publish a post on Instagram's social network.
She reported that she had not married, had not made new tattoos, and had not called her ex-wife saying that he had ruined her life, although she had much to do so.
Buzova said she'd remember this trip forever, because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Minister of Magic Cornelius Fajj in screening a series of novels about Harry Potter, died in the 92nd year of his life.
This was reported by the Independent on Thursday.
His family told him about the actor's death.
According to them, he lived "a great life, having succeeded in film, theatre and television in 70 years of his career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort city of Cheltnam.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played alongside Lawrence Olivier in the Tragedy about Coriolan.
Hardy was also remembered for his repeated role as Prime Minister of Winston Churchill, including in one of the screenings of Agatha Christie's works on Miss Marple.
For his role as Churchill in the BBC television drama "Winston Churchhill: The Wilderness Years" (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award.
Robert Hardy has also served as United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on several occasions.
Something rotted in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean Andre, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried with his venture wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the four have a golden wedding, but on the couple's agenda, it's not preparations for the celebrations, it's a seditious argument.
His Highness gave up the title of Prince Consort, with him saying to the Queen that she had never been granted the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains the Queen's official spouse.
Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on Washington to stop shaming Moscow.
In the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they responded to Mike Pence's remarks accusing Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was issued by the foreign policy department some time ago.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented that the United States was increasingly using cold war stamps, inadequate modern realities.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the American authorities to stop shaming the Russian Federation.
As The Arguments of the Week wrote the previous day, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize a failed coup d'état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive fight.
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be moving steadily towards the most exciting boxing match in the weight of up to £147 in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, an undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the champion of the World Boxing Organization in the second halfweight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-weight world champion Erian Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are part of the top five boxers regardless of weight categories.
Garcia extended his right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7:00 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Climas remarked that a potential decisive fight between them would be perfect.
"I used to be halfweight," recalled Garcia.
"I went up in the category for Broner [up to £140], but I'm not that big.
I'm not enough for 140.
I want to go down to half-light.
And he needs to get up to half a pound [to £135], and then we'll have a fight.
That's what fans want.
Let's do it for them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Box needs this fight".
Climas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of the strategy he adheres to for Lomachenko to conduct his 135-weight debut fight later this year to schedule a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, which is also interested in fighting the winner of the fight between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the World Lightweight Championship on the Forum stage on 23 September.
"The fight can be on the PPV because all fans asked for it," said Garcia, later expressing his willingness to fight on the channel that would offer better financial conditions.
"We are the main names.
No other names would be of such interest.
As soon as they're ready..."
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko is "a terrific boxer" and may be visiting his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko did not immediately shower Garcia with praises and said that he believed the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry, Mikey... you were asking for a knockout."
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the force of the punch, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension was increasing before their own fight.
"This fight must take place.
No other fight is about so much interest and talk.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
In several central streets of Moscow, traffic will be cut off for the weekend.
This weekend, August 5 and 6, the movement will be restricted in the capital on Tver Street from the Nastasian alley to the Triumphal Square, as well as on 1st Tver-Yam Street.

The streets will close from midnight on 5 August until 5 a.m. on 7 August due to their improvement.
Also on the weekend, traffic will be closed on the section of the Moscow Waterfront.
There's still the construction of the charge park.
Putin's got the Attorney General's Office checking out Baikal.
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Procurator-General ' s Office of the Russian Federation to verify the territory of Baikal for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the Office of the Attorney-General to verify the Baikal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities," said Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested that action be taken if violations were identified.
New results of tests to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden were published
Recent results of tests of asylum-seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medical age assessment show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all trust in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make an age estimate in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, Migriationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensics agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of the testees were rated as 18 years or older, and in another 25 cases the forensics agency estimated that the test was "probably 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "probably under 18".
Tests are conducted only when the age of the person is in doubt.
According to Johan Gouranceon of the forensics agency, the results match those of the past months.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics over the past months, numbers are quite relevant," he said to the portal "The Local".
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published 581 test results and reported that in 442 cases "most likely, the age of the test is 18 years or more."
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a person had openly stated that 18 was being fulfilled this year.
The method of conducting a medical assessment of age, which is to X-ray the teeth of wisdom and to scan the knee joints and give them to dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Claude Marcus Institute of Carolina, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of humans to determine whether they went through puberty before or after normal.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think I should use the measurement techniques that are being used now.
The biological age is thus very inaccurate.
If we can't define him with confidence, we shouldn't pretend we can," he said to Metro.
However, Göranssen of the forensics agency spoke in favour of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of mistaking a child as an adult is small.
We face the greatest risk when a man is about 18, in which case he is about 10 per cent."
I'll see if I can run for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was willing to consider running for Russian President in the 2018 election, transmitting the Interfax.
This statement was a response to a request from the villagers of Cheremushka province of Buryat.
During a video conference devoted to the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, Putin was approached by an interlocutor, saying, "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request for you: when the next presidential election comes, we are all asking you to run again for this post."
"Well, I'll think about it, thank you," the president replied.
On 28 July, Russian President Dmitry Peskov's spokesman commented on the comments of some media outlets that Vladimir Putin's campaign staff would be headed by Anton Weino, chief of the RF's administration.
Peskov referred to these assumptions as "nothing based on, hypothetical reasoning."
"As long as there's no headquarters, until headquarters are set up, it's a long way to campaign," Peskov said.
"Until it's on the agenda," said Peskov.
Governor of West Virginia stated that he was moving to another party.
Governor of West Virginia, Democratic Party spokesman Jim Justice announced on Thursday, during a rally with President Trump, that he was moving to another party.
"You like it or not, but the Democrats have distanced themselves from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I tell you with many prayers and many reflections... Today I tell you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of use to you by remaining a Democratic governor."
The match exploded with applause.
"So tomorrow I will change my registration to Republican," added Justice.
"As a coach, I would tell you that time to play differently".
Trump previously promised that an important statement would be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by a 42 percent margin, and Justice did not support Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement on Thursday evening that "Governor Justice's transition to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party that is more obstructing than working to make our country great again."
"Considering only 15 governors and control of the lowest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's statement is just another rejection of a party that has no top-down leaders and is unable to find positive, unifying messages," said CBS News spokesman Ronna McDaniel of the Republican Party National Committee.
Cat heavyweights by name Mr. Handsome found the house thanks to social media.
Pittsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A.,'s pet eater has a cat named Mr. Handsome weighing more than 14 kilograms after it became famous thanks to the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was published on Facebook on the nursery account, asking him to find its host because "it was clearly fed by someone before."
Users commented that the expression of an animal's face could be a new meme.
The publication generated over 3.2 thousand likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to shelter Mr. Handsome.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take over his weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, an American woman said that she had already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
The animal photo post collected over 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she might well have made a career in the modeling business.
Coe praised Russia's "true" apology for the doping scandal.
International athletics specialist Sebastian Coe praised on Thursday what he described as sincere apologies from Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that this is not a good time to allow the country to participate again in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of the Athletics Federation, Dmitry Schlachtin, reported at the Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics, that his country's exclusion from sports competition was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized "to all athletes who had gold and silver medals stolen at the competition".
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the evidence of the use of government-funded doping.
"I thought today's response, today's report was very sincere," the president of the International Association of Athletic Federations Coe told reporters.
"The whole council and the entire Congress enjoyed...that the Russian Federation itself admits that it was going through extremely hot times and now does everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation."
Coe said that he also "liked" that Russia accepted the criteria for its recovery.
"I believe it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of a special commission that now is not the time to restore Russia to rights," Koh said.
"In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to deal with this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate pure athletes from the stained system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletic Federations will participate under a neutral flag in the World Championship in Athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, stated on Monday that a number of requirements had yet to be met in order to rebuild Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a report made at the board of the International Association of Athletic Federations, drug testing is still not done in sufficient volume, and suspended coaches are still doing their job calmly.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of being a State official.
Arrested by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), journalist Vasily Muravitsky was arrested for two months and handed over to the SBU.
A staff member of the Internet publication Journal Zhitomir is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and violating Ukraine's territorial integrity.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against a journalist, considering it a “varvarian policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to undertake a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The commandant Borsini patrol ship entered Libya's territorial waters to stop the influx of illegal migrants, together with the Libyan Navy.
The decision to launch the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed to it with the internationally recognized Libyan Government, which does not control much of the country's territory.
The opposition cabinet and the Tobruk-based Libyan parliament accused Italy of violating Libyan sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they stated that they did not believe those threats and intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in talks by Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni and Head of the Europe-recognized Libyan Cabinet Faiz Saraj.
Italian authorities have embarked on the establishment of a maritime mission to combat illegal migration since statistics were released in July on the number of illegal arrivals from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government has stated that resources to receive migrants have been exhausted.

Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
Two Ukrainian athletics team leaders suspended from participation in the FM
Olga Landak and Olesa Povh, who specialize in short-distance running, are excluded from Ukraine's team for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Athletics of the Country (FLAU).
Such a decision was taken by the executive board of the organization in connection with the launching of disciplinary proceedings against athletics by the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF).
Trainer Grauk Sergei Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects female athletes to use doping.
Powh is a bronze medalist for the 2012 Olympics and 2011 World Championships, a European champion in the 4 to 100 metres relay, and a Earther is the winner of the 2012 European Championship in the 4 to 400 metres relay.
The World Athletics Championships in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How Soccer's Financial Rules Will Affect Neimar's Moving to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not interfere with the world record-setting transfer of Neumar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint-Germain.
Any consequences may follow the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain by UEFA, the governing body in charge of European football, in whose power teams are prohibited from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the rules of the financial "fireplay" introduced by UEFA in 2011, it appears that the "SPG" will eventually have to show that the Neumar transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid €222 million ($262 million) for only releasing the Brazilian from the contract, and Neumar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neimar's move to France.
The SGW can definitely pay to hire Neumar and add it to the galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling Qatar family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on buying players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
A former French footballer believed that clubs that took on huge debt in their quest for success were in fact cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP ceased to focus on club debt and instead shifted to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential and then seriously spend to improve the team and create a world brand – became a difficult plan.
During this three-year evaluation period, which is exciting in 2018, clubs may suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini's disgraceful withdrawal from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
"Of course, the FFP is alive, and we will move forward to tighten the rules," stated Associated Press Agency Andrea Traverso last week, controlling the FFP in UEFA.
Even though the SGC would pay for the purchase of Neimar's contract at one time, it could, for the sake of accountability, distribute that amount over the entire term of his contract.
Neumar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in annual accounts as a cost of €44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were imposed on SGW, as well as on Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
The SGC was fined 60 million euros (at that rate of $82 million), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit its team at the Champions League during the 2014–1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA tracks clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspectorates by blowing up its income from companies associated with club owners.
Although the Qatari company could sponsor the SGW, if the amount of funding were considered to be above standard market costs, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the funding of the CSW from the Qatar Tourism Authority had been inflated.
It was reported that part of Neimar's earnings to the SGC could come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But the SGW and Qatar-2022 deny that Neumar would become World Cup ambassador, and similar maneuvers could easily be discovered by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on the CSW mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in tracking any attempt to circumvent the rules.
According to persons familiar with the situation, UEFA did not have preliminary discussions with the SGC on the Neumar transfer on Thursday.
They spoke to Associated Press on an anonymous basis, as they were not authorized to discuss the provision of the "SGW".
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, SGC earned more than 10 million euros in profits with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The report for the last financial year has not yet been published.
The SGW expects the arrival of Neumar to be a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, the sale of attribute and T-shirts with the team logo.
At the club, turnover is expected to grow by at least 30 per cent due to the hiring of a new player.
Unbelievably angry that one of the best football players was leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent the Neumar transfer, claiming that the SGC would violate the financial "fair play".
"This is an obvious case of "financial doping", with the club and the state," stated Spanish newspaper AS, President Javier Tebas of La League, meaning that Qatar is the ultimate owner of the SGC.
Arsenal coach Arsen Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La League's doubts about the club's funding by the state.
"It's all the consequences of equity participation, and it completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years," stated Wenger on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to keep up with the financial Fairplay, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The President will determine the manner and location of the oath.
Where and how new Russian citizens will pledge allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the President - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have been drawn up by the State Committee on Legislation and State Building.
As early as a week ago, MPs planned to directly define the oath of office in the law.
Children under the age of 18 and those incompetent will be exempted from taking a solemn oath, as follows from the revised text of the amendments to the draft law on citizenship of the Russian Federation (as it is in the possession of the News), which the committee will consider on 11 July before its second reading at its meeting.
On 6 June, President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of swearing in on the Russian citizenship instead of formally signing documents during a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The members of the Parliament have adopted this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the revocation of the decision to grant citizenship to those who have subsequently been convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist offences: for example, public calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (article 205.2, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code), as well as for the hijacking of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is linked to terrorism (article 211, paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code).
According to the bill, his logic was this: in issuing citizenship documents, a person subscribes to a promise to abide by Russian law - by embarking on the path of extremism, he violates that promise.
In April, the bill was introduced in the State Duma by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasiliev (Uniform Russia), Gennady Züganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (Justly Russia) and the Speaker of DG Viacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the deputies accepted it on first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Building and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but it has now been reworked.
It now states that the President of the Russian Federation will establish the order of the oath.
Previously, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the Citizenship Act of the Russian Federation, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the State coat of arms and the Russian flag in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place, a list of places where the coat of arms of the Russian Federation could be placed, is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include the courts, the offices of the heads of State of the constituent entities, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, the heads of the federal executive, etc.
Most likely, it could also be a registry.
A solemn oath will be issued to those who wish to acquire Russian citizenship after officials have checked their documents.
But the Russian passport will be obtained only after the person has sworn in, and follows from the finalized text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text stated that Russia would be sworn in from the age of 18 rather than the age of 14.
The rule that would exempt persons with disabilities or limited legal capacity, as well as those who could not pronounce, read or sign the oath themselves, had been retained.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt “other persons” from this procedure.
The updated bill also lays down a special procedure for the admission to Russian citizens of Ukraine who are considered Russian speakers.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting a declaration to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application would need to be handed over to Russian officials.
A waiver of “foreign” nationality will not be required, as it is now, if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons beyond the individual's control”.
A corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among whom the first vice-speaker, DG Ivan Melnikov (PRPF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all “Uniform Russia”).
I think a lot of you know it's unrealistic to get a certificate from Ukraine, but it's just impossible.
Consequently, there are a lot of people waiting to decide their fate about Russian citizenship, as explained the previous day by the head of the Duma's Committee on State Building and Legislation, Pavel Krascheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on the holding of certain positions for foreigners would not apply to those who had renounced “other” citizenship in writing and had submitted a previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but “for reasons beyond its control” he had not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from holding positions in the municipal service and from being recruited to work in facilities and organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Nor may a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country become a member of the State Duma or a member of the Council of the Federation.
It is planned that the law will enter into force on 1 September 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws will be ready.
Nostalgia becomes niche in The Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective.
The present iteration of history is nostalgically reminiscent simultaneously of the glorious days of the characters in the 1980s; of the age of grange in the 1990s (about at a time when distinguished masters David Wayne and Michael Schovalter made a comedy of sketches "State" for MTV); and of themselves—that is, of 2001—before her stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poler and Paul Rudd moved to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the rise and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, she seems anachronistic.
"The first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of absurdist humor (including the original story of the talking can of vegetables voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually interested children who only have reached adulthood; thus the inability to return to the joke becomes part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have played already adults, has less profound emotional roots, and its parody is more erratic and includes riffs from 1990s stalker films like "Rooks swinging the cradle".
In one episode, the character draws Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991".
Many of the story moves are the same.
Good-hearted Coop (Showalter), now a writer, still has not gained reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't broken up with his virginity.
And there's also a crazy and mean conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Shawalter), now instigated by George Bush Sr. (tested parody performed by Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is retreating from it.
It's particularly fun to see a young Rudd singing Matt Dillon's song from Single, whose character, former big man Andy, looks like an old man now.
To bring success to this franchise could be accidental madness in the spirit of the recursive series Seven Up until it reached what I think would be its logical conclusion: "A hot American summer: twenty years later", where in the last scene, the entire company would go to the film for the premiere of the film Hot American Summer.
Comrade Detective in the Amazon turns to another type of nostalgia: the memories of the Cold War from the American, the Explosion Blonde, or even the Flash with its images of the East and West struggle.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Reese Thomas, portrays a television film: the 1980s Romanian police drama about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism, and the Marxist-Lenin route.
The main roles - that saw Gregor's life and the idealist Josef - are played by Florin Pierrecic Jr. and Cornelius Street, and their dialogues in English Channing Tatum (also executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
That's a brilliant idea.
But just an idea.
There are several visual jokes (police spends time watching a chess match as Americans could watch football).
A team of famous voices behind the frame - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali, and Chloe Sevinya - makes it interesting to play guess the voice.
But Comrade Detective holds on to the truth of a clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - that often looks like her.
Six long episodes are long, and it's funny not very often.
If it were short, Comrade Detective could better handle his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Josef come to the American embassy, there are two fat people sitting in the lobby eating a bunch of hamburgers.
Imaginable Communist viewer this image says that Western culture is capable of making obese out of anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them, too.
The prize fund for the Russian Super Bowl football match between Spartacus and Locomotive would be about 30 million rubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergei Pratkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that, to date, there were almost no tickets left for the match.
The Spartacus-Locomotive match will be held on Friday, 14 July, at 9:30.
According to TASS, Spartacus is an active Russian champion, and Locomotive is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young Uphimns cleaned the furniture shop for 200,000 rubles.
The other day, a 37-year-old Ufiman with a furniture firm contacted the police.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the shop, causing serious damage to its production.
The thieves' preyed on instruments worth nearly 200,000 rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulician, a winch.
The security guards began to search for the criminals and soon came out to residents of the Bashkortostan Blaviden District, 23 and 24-year-old friends.
According to the press services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, the accomplices entered the premises of the enterprise, broke into the front door and carried out the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold stolen equipment to the first car service they got.
They had already been prosecuted for theft, and law enforcement officers had been able to recover only some of the stolen instruments.
State Department commented on Medvedev's words about Russian-US relations
The US and Russia must be able to work with each other.
Such a statement was made by the official spokesman of the State Department, Heather Nowert, in response to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of the Russian Federation, on the relations between the two States.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government stated that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US ended the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nowert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were "lower", but noted that there was a need to look for "areas for interaction."
"Look at the truce in southwest Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the US and Russia," says the diplomat RIA News.
At the same time, the foreign policy spokesman refused to comment on the Russian Premier's statement that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and the DPRK was signed by US President Donald Trump on the previous Wednesday.
In doing so, he acknowledged that the document had failed and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior raised roses from amethysts and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - complemented the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
They had five new rings and three necklaces on velvet ribbons.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line produced two new rings and a pendant of amethysts, pink quartz, and diamonds made in gliptic technique (hand carving on stone) and pawage and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoire de Castellan was inspired by roses that grew at their estate in Granville by modeler Christian Dior, and the Paris Gardens of Bagatelle and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found the perpetrators of the deterioration of relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump strongly criticized members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia is at an unprecedentedly low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president tweeted.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and the DPRK.
They will affect Russian banks and energy companies in particular.
The White House subsequently circulated a statement by the President, in which he indicated that the law would not allow the US to make profitable deals and would bring the Russians, China, and North Korea even closer.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy Ukrainian daughter Sberbank
An entrepreneur from Belarus, Victor Procopenja, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to BBC with the intention "to focus on our other planned investments and projects that we're working on."
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a move would be "the best investment of time", despite the investment attractiveness of buying Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenja became the main claimant for the purchase of a unit of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the NorvikBank consortium bid by Gregory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guceriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Peter Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
In addition to the WTB and the Wneshaconombank, Sberbank was one such financial organization.
Novak gave me the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation has named the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
Aleksandr Novak, head of the department, explained the incident.
He said that the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident in Krasnodar Krai.
A truck hit the transmission lines and resulted in the shutdown of Cuban and associated Crimean networks.
Power failures in major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The experts resolved the malfunction within a few hours.
Originally, it was reported that the blackout could have been caused by an abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and declining inflation have caused rumours of a possible rise to fade.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain slow, leaving interest rates unchanged among the growing pressure on family income.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 in favour of maintaining rates at 0.25 per cent, with a smaller number of committee members this month in favour of increasing the rate because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its projections to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, and warned that pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to around 3 per cent in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes over the next few years would be necessary to control brexit-induced inflation, and stated that borrowing costs would likely have to be raised more than expected in financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to abandon part of the huge economic development package launched a year ago because of the brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan, under which it provides banks with cheap loans, although he has reported that he now has to provide another 15 billion pounds – up to 115 billion pounds – under the plan.
In the rate decision protocol, the bank said, "In line with the major MPC projections, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) remains slow in the near future, while pressure on real household income continues to affect consumption."
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that a “some tightening of financial policies” would be required in order to halt inflation, at a “some greater” level than the markets expected.
Markets are currently predicting their first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all promotions would be "progressive" and "limited".
The bank's projections for growth in this and next year are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The bank left its forecast unchanged at 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After this news, Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 per cent to US$1.31 and 0.4 per cent to Euro1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent disappointing growth rates weakened the expectation of an increase; GDP then increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared with 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to a bank representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice at households hit by high inflation and very small wage increases: according to the bank, pressure would increase before falling.
The Bank added that financial policies "can't prevent" the Udao's earnings in the next few years, but expects salaries "significantly" to recover by the end of his three-year forecast.
The economy is also committed to growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods due to the low pound rate, which offsets some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision was made one year after the rates were reduced to 0.25 per cent last August following the shocking results of the exit referendum that caused the pound to fall.
According to bank estimates, it is likely that it will take four years to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last rate decision, there was increasing noise around the anticipated rate rise, as inflation was increasingly pressuring already pressured households: the three committee experts requested that the rates be raised to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although according to the bank the fall was expected and again compensated in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher proportion than the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the low pound rate.
Andrew Montlake, director of Korea's Mortgage Brokers, said, "With the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again, as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good conclusion of the year.
The market seems particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing treaties, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no commission as well as a low rate, becomes more popular than ever."
The public health service will prescribe a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” HIV-prevention drug after the battle in the High Court of Justice on funding the drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposition HIV prevention (PRE), a pre-sex pill that has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in persons at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service during an initial three-year probation period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the test after the Court of Appeal upheld last year the High Court ruling claiming that the National Health Service had an opportunity to pay for the EEOC despite her statements that it should be funded by local authorities.
This move, announced on Thursday, was described as "the most important innovation" by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it "a turning point".
Prior to the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, the Venerologic dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be among the first to begin registering people, and more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Pre-exposition prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV drugs that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Research has shown that EPP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When admitted to PEP before sex, there are enough certain drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or not later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender persons and people whose partners are HIV positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensers will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender persons and persons whose partners are unknown whether their HIV status is being contained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in a nearby Venereal Dispensary participating in the program.
The program will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England has signed a drug supply contract this week after an international procurement bid.
The study is designed to assess all the capabilities of the PEC by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its absorption and use on a large scale.
“This essential innovation should complement and strengthen the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in combating one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National AIDS Control Authority), stated, "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PEC, if properly targeted at people in need and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Beginning in September, people at risk for HIV, through this study conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new opening tool that a person can control himself without discussing it with his partner, which will lead to improvements in many and many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Jan Greene, the president of Terrence Higgins Foundation, said, "Now is the first thing that needs to be done to ensure that the test is quickly deployed across the country, and that none of the HIV risk groups are forgotten.
Now that we have been provided with an experimental drug, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV."
Shadow Minister of People's Health Sharon Hodgson said, "We very much welcome the start of the PEE test, it's very late due to months of delays and delays on the part of the government."
The data show how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of the EESP.
It is now important that the test be deployed throughout the country as soon as possible to protect those at risk of HIV and move us one step further towards halting the spread of HIV in society.
The Tatar World Congress adopted a resolution on support for the Tatarstan and Russia Treaty
The Sixth Congress of the World Tatar Congress (WTC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the post of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a positive form of organization of the highest State authority in the Republic and expresses the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, it “played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
Let us recall that the agreement between Moscow and Kazanyu, in force since 24 July 2007, was concluded for 10 years.
On 11 July, members of the State Council of Tatarstan asked the Russian President to extend the agreement and retain the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only entity in the Federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one called the president.
In Russia, difficulties have arisen in obtaining international driving permits
There is a shortage of international driving permits (IDPs) for HBHD units.
In order to obtain such rights, it takes several weeks to wait for queues, which has become a real problem for vacationers who wish to go abroad to rest in their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with regard to international driving permits remains controversial.
The IDP was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, as the information is explained in five languages.
Requirements for international rights are contained in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are recognized in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
In fact, however, it depends on a particular police or rental office: some demand IDPs, and some have sufficient national rights.
In order to be protected, drivers do receive international rights, but it should be borne in mind that in countries that have not ratified the convention (e.g. the United States, Mexico, Spain, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or IDPs.
There is now a problem with the forms in almost all parts of the HBDD, as reported by Commersant, having conducted a study in several regions.
In Moscow, for example, the UGIDD units simply do not issue stamps, and the forms have been missing for four months.
You can make an appointment on the public service website, but it's already a long line up until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, IDPs cannot be obtained "for technical reasons" without going into detail, it is honestly said in the Samara region that there are no forms, a similar situation occurs in other cities.
Many Moscowmen have already faced the problem, and social media reports are becoming more frequent:
Irina Burmistrov: "Well, guess why you can't get international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, 'cause all the HBHD wards ran out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A Question to Knowledgeable People!"
We need to get international rights on an urgent basis.
Moscow is always far ahead, and there are no tickets at all on the spot (the button has but cannot give a ticket).
It's like the public service portal shows that Spb's time is full of shit.
Did anyone try to get in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for the forms of international driving permits have changed, so new forms are being supplied to the State Auto Inspection units.
This may be linked to the deficit, but it is not clear what changes are being made, this has not been previously reported.
Blanci procures the Special Purpose Centre for Road Safety (SDSC) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivers them to the units of the HYBD.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with the Gosnak OO: almost 200,000 IDP forms were produced in 2014 - 2015, 15,000 forms were purchased in 2016, 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was awarded on 18 July to the First Printing Court LLC for 70,000 forms.
There is a theory that the CSN simply failed to hold the tender in time, causing a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: due to the crisis, many people did not travel on their own to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries, such as China, Thailand, and so on.
What rights are accepted there is not entirely clear, so people are re-insured, so there is an intense demand for international root.
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to take an examination to prove their qualifications.
The proposal was made by Mintrans.
The new international driving permit (IDP) has been in effect since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko stated that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
That's what he said in an interview with the Observer portal on Friday, August 4.
No self-respected international company will even put a baton or nut in there because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan – in countries that have joined sanctions against Russia against Crimea.
"I mean, in my deep belief, there is virtually no prospect for this project," Petrenko said.
He added that he found Russia unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot properly build smaller-scale objects.
I know that after the Sochi Olympics, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse.
"So I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have proved to be so shortsighted as to join this project," said the official.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the car arch of the Crimean Bridge.
A large-scale assembly of the Crimean Bridge road arch has been completed on the Kerchen bank: its vault is closed at 45 metres from the base of the structure.
"One-time bridgebuilders have prepared a rail arch for installation on fairway supports," reported at the project information centre.
In April, the head of the Mintrans, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was ahead of schedule.
Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and Krasnodar Krai.
In Spain, an official who hasn't been to work in 10 years was fired.
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to the public service) should the Spanish official chief, Carles Recio, have?
The permanent hiatus lasted 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was dismissed.
But not his immediate superior.
There's a lot of things that happen in the bureaucrat world.
The visitors seem to have been used to all the "people's services" stuff for a long time.
And yet officials are always able to surprise those whose taxes they live well on.
This time, the "sense" came from Spain.
There, a member of Valencia's archives, Carlos Recio, managed to stay out of work for ten years.
In doing so, he received regular salary.
And all the solid is 50,000 euros a year.
And now Mr. Recio's "great times" are over.
He was dismissed by the Valencia Legislature.
The investigation revealed that a vicious hijacker came to the office every working morning at 0700 hours to check in on the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again, he appeared at the workplace at 4 p.m. to report back to the system that he had left.
It's been ten years.
It was also revealed that all the free time the walker devoted to drawing comic books at home.
The members of the Valencian Legislative Assembly now wonder how to punish Mr. Recio's immediate superior, who could not but know how to “actively work” in his workplace.
Judges are offered protection from presidents
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (CHR), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes that the powers of the presidents of the courts be limited and that their election be introduced.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HRC wishes to introduce special districts which will not be tied to the administrative division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals under the Presidential Instruction.
HRC has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the HRC on behalf of Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with the council.
At a meeting with the council on 8 December 2016, some cases of judicial arbitrariness were discussed, as well as problems of public scrutiny in places of detention (see IO of 9 December).
The work of the HRC resulted in 25 proposals that deal both with the independence of the judiciary and the detection of judicial errors and with the financing of the courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlev human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the post of judge has successfully passed the competition and has received the support of the judiciary, the HRC is of the view that the president of the court should submit him for appointment without the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to allocate cases to judges.
It's open to experts, it can be a specially written computer program.
The HRC also considers that the President is not entitled to “predicate the results of the judge's qualification, initiate disciplinary proceedings against him or her, and decide on additional material payments”.
In doing so, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move towards “the election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves” and to “invigorate their powers for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation”.
All the presidents of the courts (from the Republic to the District) are now appointed for six years by the President on the proposal of the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HRC proposes to re-organize appeals and cassation in the ordinary courts.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC states that “the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation should be ensured, not at the level of the regional judicial authorities in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts”.
The experts are based on the practice of arbitral tribunals.
They have “judicial districts” which do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but which thus guarantee greater independence from regional officials who are hampered by the use of “telephone law”.
HRC Justices of the Peace propose that the people's assessors strengthen their involvement in certain “classes of civil and administrative cases”.
For example, deprivation of parental rights, reinstatement at work, protection of honour and dignity, deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"It's just our proposals," explained "I'm a member of the HRC, a retired Constitutional Court judge, Tamara Morchkov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate related not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time before the armed forces (among the co-authors, the Office of the Attorney-General and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation) can carry out their mission.
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in the Russian Federation, the president of the armed forces, Vyacheslav Lebedev, is due before 1 September.
Living a high life: semi-story and crafty designer techniques turned this small apartment into an Earls Court apartment into a spacious dwelling
Joan Lee, a former real-estate banker, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a pretty model Queen Anne-style house, and in favor of a new design says Joan didn't pack her things and move again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger square," Joan says.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were just as high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered the price the same day."
Since the first look, a 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Originally, it was an apartment with one bedroom complex layout – to get into the bedroom, it had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and semi-storey to squeeze the maximum benefit out of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural and design studio, Duck & Shed, to use ceilings of 12.5 feet high and create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project, but would be Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-storey where you could stand at full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the brift.
"Work with steel structures is very complex," he explains.
"We had to place the premises so that they were one above the other, and we didn't have to bend.
It was not just necessary to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they would be at the right height and allow the rooms to be used from above and below."
This decision allowed Erfan to set up two full-size rooms one over the other in space – and many more interesting.
From the semi-story through the vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" opens a view of the gorgeous living room below.
Mirror furniture with gold finish, silver accents, and vintage lighting devices from Serge Muy set the design style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, width, and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror shield appears to be a window in the other room.
At the entrance, mirror cupboards are used to store Joan's entire dish.
To create a sense of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block itself in the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new about the kitchens that are coming up.
The unique thing about this kitchen is that it's a moving door up like a garage.
"This was where engineering art was involved," Erfan tells of the reinforced steel-based fibreboard door.
"It has a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily".
Due to the prudent use of space and storage facilities, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom, and improved layout.
"In the end, floor space is exactly what you're going to sell, that is, what your real estate is valued by," Erfan says.
"Deadly speaking, a real estate agent will enter and calculate based on floor space".
Here, they were able to increase the area of the sexes by using quality materials that provide a shade of luxury.
"Motherals are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the house," Erfan says.
"Nobody falls in love with the wiring in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't hurt the strings of our hearts."
This is evidence that through good design and increased meterage, an apartment can turn from something conventional to something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a cultural policy commission
The Russian Government has approved the establishment of a commission on State cultural policy.
The relevant regulation has been published on the Government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policies.
The Commission will also draft a cultural policy strategy, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The head of the commission has been appointed Vice-President of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, approved in 2016 a plan for the implementation of the State cultural policy strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and includes measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve a unified cultural space and cultural heritage, and contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries decreased to a minimum of eight years
Consumer price increases in G20 countries have declined to the minimum in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimates inflation in June 2016 at 2 per cent, with lower values in October 2009, when the price rise index reached 1.7 per cent.
Rosstat had previously reported a 0.1 per cent decline in the consumer price index in Russia.
The agency thus recorded the first week-long deflation in 2017.
The inflation rate in Russia is estimated by the Ministry of Finance to be 4.1 per cent.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs, however, believes that the target has already been achieved - the figure is 4 per cent according to this agency.
Putin warned against illegal cutting out of the Baykal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned at a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Bayal Territory against illegal forest destruction.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donska, noted that a bill had been drafted earlier.
It allows logging during fire-fighting, and the government plans to receive it in the fall.
In turn, the President stated that the project should be kept under review to ensure that, in the process of cutting out, "it's not out of order."
Donska noted that the bill involved monitoring by the MES and oversight agencies.
Media: U.S.A. fighters negotiate with Donbass militia in secret from the command
Regular telephone calls have been established on the armed confrontation line in Donbass.
Fighters on opposing sides communicate with each other on mobile phones all the time, and they don't know about it at headquarters.
WSU fighters and Donbass militia have established cellular phone communication in secret from their high command.
This is reported by Country.ua on 4 August, citing members of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication, unit commanders are well aware of the names of their counterparts on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on telephones daily.
Communication is not at all domestic: commanders are trying to reach some kind of "tactical arrangement."
Such talks often result in a truce on a certain section of the front.
Journalists have learned of cases where an officer received birthday congratulations from outside the front line, from his formal enemy.
WSU fighters and DNR and LNR militia have been sitting in trenches on the line of separation since spring 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbass.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was outraged by the blocking of the UN Security Council ' s allegations of attacks on the Russian Embassy.
In the Russian foreign policy department, we are outraged by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives, which block the press statements by Sovbeza of the United Nations condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The agency was reminded that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on 2 August was the third time in a month that the terrorist groups Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in the Russian Federation) and Fylac Al-Rahman had fired mortar shells.
Given that the international community is unanimous in the characterization of “Nusra” as a terrorist organization, and the resolutions of the UN Security Council call for a response to this structure, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation noted that “it would seem, of course, that the Nusra terrorist attacks should be universally condemned unconditionally and decisively, and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions”.
However, as stressed in the Department, “for the third time in a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of the objections, under cover of the alleged lack of information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft statement of the Security Council to the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital”.
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of those delegations.
“The most outrageous thing is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to commit further provocations and acts of terrorism, gives them a sense of impunity,” said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and added that “it would not be desirable for these barbarians to have the conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them”.
Vladimir Putin advocated limiting the number of unscheduled business audits
Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East, stated that the number of unscheduled checks on entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned number, as well as the need to limit the duration of inspections to ten days.
“Unscheduled inspections are generally carried out without appropriate agreement with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2 to 3 per cent are coordinated with the Public Prosecutor's Office, and everything else goes on its own”, quotes the President of TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from seizing servers and hard drives from businesses.
In addition, the President believed that business associations should be empowered to defend the interests of their members in court.
“This, hopefully, will make a certain positive difference in dealing with business-related cases or business-related breaches of the law”, said the Head of State.
As IA reported, other types of business inspections are increasing due to the moratorium on routine inspections.
In May, at the request of the Business Ombudsman under President Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, which revealed that there had actually been a substitution of scheduled checks by non-scheduled (the proportion of those facing them increased from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), by prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), by raiders (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), and by civil complaints (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and by administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More about the business checks in "I" for small business came from the other side.
Brothers fight for a real estate empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest empires in the real estate trade, worth over $500 million, forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin de Lutis lives in Turak Palace three doors from his younger brother Paul, who sued him in the Supreme Court for the division of ownership and assets.
Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014, but in the Supreme Court there is still a fierce dispute over the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna's brothers own 87 properties worth over half a billion dollars bought since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's property list today includes office buildings, development plots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Bank and Mount Buller, and shopping centers in suburbs.
By agreement with Colin's late father, who Paul describes as the "major driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, he owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul has about one third.
According to the court, this means Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's property is 176 million.
The division of property and money became Paul's stumbling block.
"The section offered by Colin gives him, in my view, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first Supreme Court hearings were held.
The brothers are now debating who will control the existing business, from which Paul believes Colin has excluded him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but blames Paul for the incompetent management of some objects.
In the testimony Colin gave at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority," he wrote.
Court costs are rising as a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are included in the case; both sides have engaged the most prominent lawyers, including King Allan Myers, and the best cooks.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s they have run dairy bars and gastronoms, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood that opened Colin's first family jeans store.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last grade of school, and Paul was then a boy (about 10 years)".
Anna De Lutis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their property to their sons without conflict.
"Louigi often told me he didn't want the brothers to know in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, no longer belong to the De Lutis group; Colina says Mark received $10 million when he left the business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their office."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGir, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied with a text message saying that since the case had not yet been tried, "I really have nothing to say."
"I'm very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and talk in court the name of our family," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a statement that he was trying to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want to see Paul and I arguing in court," he said, adding, "still hoping to resolve the conflict."
On Friday, that hope seemed to have dissipated.
"A judgment on our case will soon be handed down by the court," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
In that case, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, in the hope of keeping the Chief calm.
That's what reporter Josh Dosey says.
"At a meeting held by the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly with staff management on his first working day, he identified the main problem at the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: poor channels of information to the president".
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through it - in paper form or through briefings - because the president would be better at making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is perfectly correct, but others have already failed in trying to control Trump by tracking the information to him.
President Trump's relationship with television began decades ago - and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching television is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by unfair campaign coverage, it was useful to demonstrate to him that he had received fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded," said "Politico" Sam Nanberg, a former electoral staff adviser in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in Politico that "according to six former members of the election staff, to keep Trump's Twitter habit under control, you had to make sure that there was a constant stream of praise in the personal information he received."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the election staff know something we don't know, for example, that if it weren't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets Trump hasn't published.
If his staff saved him at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always been able to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people constantly try to advance their summons by providing Trump with material - reliable or not - that confirms their views.
"Politico" - just to this story - wrote in May about the tendency of councillors to constantly give the president questionable information.
Consider one example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Trump's current and former employees say Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
This was the case in late February, when someone slipped to the president a printout of an article from GotNews.com, an Internet provocator website of Charles C. Johnson, in which Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Welsh was accused of being "standing behind a number of leaks" in the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson's been tweeted forever for aggressive behavior, that he didn't present specific facts, or that in the past he'd run false charges and then drop them.
Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Welsh."
Goldmacher adds that then head of staff Raines Pribus and staff secretary Rob Porter "tryed to build a system to control and document the flow of paper that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same thing.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has impulsive nature, and his aides continue to fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The Tumen Public Prosecutor's Office is fighting against an HIV-dissociated woman
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the ruling of the Kalininsky Rayud of Tumeni, who had dropped the criminal case against a local resident whose HIV-related death had been caused by a young daughter.
The child is said to have died because the mother is HIV-dissociated and refused treatment.
However, the court relieved her of responsibility in connection with her reconciliation with the father.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be allowed to go unpunished without setting a precedent for other HIV-dissidents.
The case against a woman resident of Tumeni was instituted under article 109, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (a cause of death by negligence) in April, after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
"Woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection did not exist," explained the Prosecutor's Office of Tumen Oblast.
The criminal case went to the Kalininsky Rayud of Tumeni, who decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The request was made by the deceased girl's father, explaining that he had "simplified his wife, had no claim against her, she made amends and apologized."
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office did not accept the court ' s decision and filed an appeal, demanding that the decision to dismiss the case be quashed and referred to a new hearing.
The girl died, and it's impossible to make up for the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-positive mother refused to examine the baby and treat her with a dangerous infection, despite the doctors' advice," reported to the prosecution's press service.
In the view of the supervisory authority, it should be punished, otherwise other HIV-dissidents would follow suit.
As reported at the Tumen AIDS Centre, some 12 children living with HIV in the Tyumensk region now receive no medical care because of parents' refusal.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of the special group's work, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV changed their mind - they allowed them to diagnose, they started taking medication," said Elena Losev, a spokesman for the AIDS Centre.
She said that parents could not be legally affected and that not all HIV-infected children could be found - mothers were prevented from examining them, hiding themselves and running away from hospitals.
The risk of HIV-dissidence
At the end of last year, Peterburg sociologists presented the results of the first study of the so-called HIV-dissident movement in Russia.
HIV-dissidents refer to people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Medics and AIDS service activists in the NDA call such views anti-medical and view their distribution as a serious threat.
The horrible photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Greeka railway station in Khmelnicki.
A fun company of drunk young people walked the bridge over the railway tracks, where a freight train was standing.
One friend had the idea of making a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, and told FACTAM in the police communications sector in Khmelnitsky Oblast.
The guy started coming down from a bridge onto a train, but due to his negligence, he got caught up in the power line and was electrocuted instantly.
Fortunately, this incident came to the attention of the station manager, who immediately called in an emergency.
Prior to the arrival of the doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place and then hospitalized to the burn ward of Khmelnitsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
Males were diagnosed with 1 to 2 degrees of body burns.
His condition is now assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement recalls that extreme selfies on the roofs of multi-storeys, bridges, moving transport have become increasingly popular in recent times.
The police are encouraging people to be vigilant and to prevent such photo shoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists allowed the oceans to exist in ancient Venus
There could be oceans on ancient Venus.
French scholars have made this suggestion.
Experts created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on planet surfaces, writing Science News.
It was revealed that at the beginning of her history, the oceans formed in Venus, with 10 percent more water than they are now on Earth.
Previously, the Arguments of the Week wrote that according to the scientists' hypothesis, the ocean could have existed on Mars four billion years ago.
Foreign experts in their research concluded that the water facility was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured in a San Francisco park shooting
In San Francisco, three people were injured in the shooting, transmitting the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where there were a significant number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them grabbed a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the intruders could not be seen, as they had all but their eyes closed.
Another was treated and released.
The third injured is a minor, no details of his condition.
Located on the Hill of Dolores Park is a popular place among local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured during a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured in an attempt to leave the premises.
rock band Luna will present a new album in Barnaul
The Louna rock band concert will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album, "Dive New World", which has become one of the year's most anticipated releases.
The collective prepares a concept show that will be the brightest in the band's live history.
"Dive New World" is the fourth album by Russian rock band Luna.
Its name is related to the famous O.Haxley anti-topia novel "Oh a wonderful new world".
The new songs do not retell the book, but tell of a society that lives by the law of anti-Utopia, "blindly believing propaganda and imposed values."
The band was helped to raise money for the album's recording: more than 1,200 people supported the project on Planeta.ru.
She released her first album, "Make Thunder!" in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the record "Time X", and in 2013 recorded the album "We are Luna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, Luna's band performed a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the World Songs program.
In the group Lusine Gevorkian (vocal), Vitaly Demidenco (bas-guitar), Ruben Kazarian (guitar), Sergei Ponkratiev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will be held at the Barnaul club Faraon on 17 October at 7 p.m.
Ticket price: 1,200 to 2,600 rubles.
Luna is one of the popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The collective was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The group has won several times in various Hell's Dozen hits nominations.
The Gypsies crossed the moat and returned to the "millionaire street"
Some of West Midland's wealthiest homeowners are once again clashing with strong Gypsies who have overcome a moat dug by municipal authorities to retake the field near their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordered by the wealthy Solihalla Street, which was joked to be called the "millionaire street".
After bringing horses, infants and many homes on wheels, they returned after being expelled no further than in May, and were not prevented from a moat dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactful company found a rupture in the defensive structures and squeezed its vehicles through a section that was left uninsured to leave room for the trail.
Enraged residents attacked the municipality of Solihalla, saying that he was "incapable of solving this problem".
An anonymous local resident reported, "They came here on Monday night, after being driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by."
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act because they are totally incapable of solving the problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were driven away, and now they're back again.
More gypsies arrived last night, and perhaps more today.
"Burmingham's municipality knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I keep paying municipal tax, and the municipality can't even stop it."
A local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, "It's funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the previous time, and here, please, this attack continues."
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse pasture in the meadow."
A spokesman for Solihalla municipality stated, "We know about an illegal camp on land near Streetsbrook Road and cooperate with the Solihalla Police; we are taking the necessary legal action to get them out as soon as possible."
To help us gather evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by telephone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea is operated by the Champagne wine factory of the New Light.
The "New Light Champagne Wine Plant" of the Republic of Crimea has decided to act by transforming the "New Light Champagne Wine Plant" into the OAO, following an order from the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anuhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in the state ownership of Crimea.
The statutory capital of the stock company will be 595.5 million roubles and will consist of 5.955 million common shares with a nominal value of 100 roubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if funds were not available for the next three years to modernize the plant, the plant would be at risk of being stopped.
The wear and tear of fixed assets in the enterprise is between 60 and 70 per cent.
In order to modernize the enterprise, 1.2 billion rubles are needed. Due to the characteristics of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to pay 50 per cent of the income to the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"Getting money from the owner is problematic, talking about attracting loans from large credit organizations is difficult," said the headlines of Crimea Mincelhoza Sergei Petelin in April of this year.
The Crimean Parliament included the enterprise in the privatization forecast for 2017.
It was suggested that it be campaigned and tendered.
The Interfax source in Crimea authorities estimated the possible sale value of $40 million, the investor's investment in modernization - another $30 million.
The New Light in 2016 increased the production of playful wines by 2.8 per cent from the 2015 level to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New Light intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by Prince Lion Golitsyn as a production plant for playful wine in his acquired New World estate.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Suburban third graders defeated over 40 headstones
The officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Department for Nizhgorod oblast identified the citizens who had destroyed 46 headstones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The perpetrators were third-class students.
The first allegation that graves had been damaged by unknown persons came to the Russian Department of Internal Affairs for the Lyskov district as early as 27 June.
A total of 24 people contacted the police about this.
As a result, criminal proceedings were instituted under article 244 of the Criminal Code, “Destructing, damaging or defiling burial sites”.
The investigation resulted in the identification of suspects by police officers, who were two schoolchildren at the age of 8 and 9.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing the monuments fall, which prompted them to commit hooliganism.
Preventive measures have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone for ships of NGOs rescuing migrants.
Italy warned NGOs that owned rescue vessels in the Mediterranean Sea that they would not be able to continue their work unless they complied with the new regulations governing their activities.
"If NGOs fail to comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," said Interior Minister Mario Minnity in an interview with the Turin daily Stampa.
Minnity's warning came the day after Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew actually cooperated with traffickers and facilitated illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had been working for only one year, refused to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartosio.
"For us, the salvation of human life is and will remain a top priority, so we very much regret that we cannot now continue to operate in the search and rescue zone," states the organization's statement on social media.
"We can assess all the charges now made only after we gather all the information and assess the situation."
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa vessel belonging to the Jugend Rettet since October.
His crew is suspected of receiving migrants on board by entire lifeboats, who were sent directly to them by traffickers, and allowing smugglers to leave with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as stated in the charges, the contents of which were published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, which control rescue operations in this zone, rather from humanitarian zeal than from any other motive.
The Code of Conduct assumes mainly that the Yuvent vessels will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the Code: Save the Children, Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Open embraces from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new regulations unnecessary but acceptable, provided that they did not involve any “significant change or interference” in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minnity said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicates that efforts to support the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In the last few days we started to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any party to the conflict"
The Russian Federation authorities have recently increased their policy markedly on the Libyan track, and visits to Moscow have involved delegations of the opposing Libyan parties.
The head of the Russian Contact Group on Intra-Livian Settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, the Assistant Head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Deng, told "I" what Moscow's goals are in this region and on whom he is betting.
The contact group on Libya, which you are chairing, is hardly known.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine knows about it.
And here is the veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established at the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Her activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimanov (Deputy of the Duma from Chechnya.
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The beginning of the group was the arrest in Libya of a Russian tanker, the Mechanic Cebotarev (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board.
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, was established, and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How come you're the one who led it?
As I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the work of the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from the Chebotarev Mechanic.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all the major factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict, and with Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government is based, led by Faiz Saraj. - IA) and Tobruk (a parliament that opposes the Government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls eastern Libya. - IA).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice Prime Minister of Libya, IA), we were able to quickly negotiate the release of Russian sailors.
It was then agreed to establish a contact group to make better use of those contacts.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, and engage in dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I wish to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to associate ourselves with any of the parties to the conflict; we are engaged in dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group, and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
The contact group is now composed of five persons.
They include people with experience in the security forces, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to include in the team of regional specialists, representatives of the RA Institute of the Middle East.
No one of our staff is permanently in Libya, and that is not necessary.
Are there Russian military advisers, trainers in Libya now?
And if so, which side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group is a former military member...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
Like when we visit hot spots.
Or such closed cities for us as Misurata (where militia groups are based, who played a role in overthrowing Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and have increased markedly in the following years.
We arrived in Misurata in January of this year.
We were scared, they said it was all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess for ourselves the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who was responsible for what, why rumours such as what the real role of Islamists was.
In Misurat, we met with all the representatives of the units that were engaged in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was repulsed from militants of the banned Islamic State in Russia, IU).
We wanted to look at them, to meet these people, to check out the information that they were the ones who were the key to the destruction of the IH in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these services to himself.
And what conclusion did you come to?
The "Islamic State" in Libya didn't defeat Haftar?
He didn't do it.
Haftar performed operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And the IG in Sirte was fought by structures subordinate to the Government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we've invited to Russia the people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation.
And they came -- the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was received by the Federation Council, the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Rosg Guard.
You, as we understand it, are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the sentiments of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections that were reached in Paris at the end of July by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or, again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, agreements will be thwarted, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to take power alone?
For us, the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting was a good signal, not so long ago, that was impossible.
In the recent past, the two leaders were very negative about each other.
As for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on board the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov on that very day.
It was a coincidence.
But they didn't believe in coincidence in Misurat.
We were told, "You must be a very brave man to come to us today."
But our task is precisely to show: we do not support only Haftar, we are engaged in dialogue with all key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar have been in touch.
Does the fact that he studied twice in the USSR make it easier to understand with Russian partners on a human, emotional level?
And by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
If he knows Russian, he's very relative.
But the fact that he studied with us makes it easier to have a dialogue with him, of course.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misurat, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they are speaking Russian very well.
And stretching towards Russia, feeling a little nostalgia about it.
Do you consider it likely that the arms embargo imposed on Libya would be lifted as soon as possible?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in supplying Russian weapons?
Of course they are, but, as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict, nor do we want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like to see all of them in about equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, Libyans have constantly called for Russia to help lift it.
The constitution-making process in Libya is now well under way.
We hope that the parties will come to compromise solutions and achieve internal consensus.
Then there must be an election, which was also mentioned at the meeting between Saraj and Haftar.
If elections are held and legitimate power is finally elected (and none of the parties now has such status), the question of lifting the arms embargo can be raised in the United Nations.
It is pointless and dangerous to raise this issue now; it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
There was news in the media the other day that Italy, faced with African refugees sailing from Libya, felt abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is it that Haftar troops will control the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers transporting immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
Italians need Russia's support because Moscow has a dialogue with both Haftar and Saraj and Misurata and the south of the country.
Tribes in southern Libya play a major role in this matter, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Are we talking about the southerners stopping the flow of migrants on long-distance approaches?
So, by implication, you were turning back the buses that Nigerian migrants ride?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help unite southerners in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and tribes in the south.
But first, we would like to see a consensus on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The Head of Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered to be an Islamist who is a supporter of the establishment of sharia law in the country.
How radical is he?
Would that not be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll give him my personal opinion.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya must be an entirely normal country, a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he is also active in the fight against terrorists.
How could he have such a reputation?
It has been created by countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where the legislature, the executive and the judiciary are located.
There's a national oil corporation, a national bank, and other government entities.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of it.
And we mixed all the cards with them, and we started to communicate actively with both Tripoli and Tobruck.
We are already reaping the benefits of this work: Rosneft has concluded a cooperation agreement with the Libyan State oil company, the NOC.
The NOC director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosnefti Igor Sechin made a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with her?
I suppose I'll resell it.
What other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
Plans to re-sign contracts under Muammar Gaddafi.
These include, inter alia, previous transport arrangements (rail construction), energy (electricity) and a number of others.
Do Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, as in the case of Iran, is the oil-for-service scheme?
I don't know what the plan is, I don't deal directly with these issues.
In fact, Russia’s economy is not the main one in Libya.
We're actually doing peacekeeping work there.
For us, the most important thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya is no longer a propitious environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, that is the main task — to help the Libyan people and to push terrorists out of there.
Do you have any evidence of the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that, to date, none of the Russians and other countries of the former USSR were there.
He said he had about 50,000 phone records of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya, IA) and no Russian speech.
Which state are these fighters from?
I wouldn't want to go into those details.
Then we'll put it another way.
How many of the Islamic militants in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans, not more than 5% of them.
The others are from here.
Could Moscow hold intra-Livian talks like Paris?
There are plans.
We have been actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have indicated their willingness to come back to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say right now.
Several visits are yet to take place, and I hope that the timing and venue of the talks will be clarified.
In the Czech Museum, the philanthropists raised money for an expensive gift to a sick boy.
In the Moscow reserve museum, Melihovo, a nine-year-old boy, Sasha Mazola, who has a CDC, brain hydrocephalus and complete blindness, will receive a special treadmill on August 5 as a gift.
A useful presentation is given to Sasha by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region, Oksana Kosareva, and the Director of the Constantine Bobkov Museum.
The money for the simulator was collected during the Charitable Marathon "Don't Care to Do Good" which took place in Melikhov on July 15th of Chekhov Memorial Day.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, living in the village of Manushkino, Czech District, saying, "I have no eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I would very much like to get a treadmill as a gift to make my legs strong, and I would learn to walk a little."
And now Sasha's dream has come true!
After the performance at the memorial museum, there will be "Concert Postscriptum", a well-known pianist and well-deserved artist of Russia, Alexander Gindin, will perform popurri from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov, the choir of the Ascension Davyd Desert, the callers of the Ilya Drozdihin workshop, students of the P.I. Chaikovsky Moscow Conservatory and Russian Gnesinsky Academy, and artists of the Melichov Theatre of Chekhov Studio were featured.
There were auctions, book fairs and charitable sale of souvenirs with a marathon logo for visitors.
The Melikhovo protected museum took the initiative to make Czechov's Memorial Day 15 July a single charity day in all the Modskowya Museums.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk of Zhitomir Oblast near the local football stadium shot several times towards the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angry with the noise, reported to FACTAM in the communications department of the Zhitomir region police.
The man then went to a cafe nearby.
In the building, he had a conflict in which a man used rubber bullets to injure a visitor.
A 34-year-old victim has been provided with the necessary medical care and his life is not at risk.
Police and ambulances arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by that time.
The law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a device taken off rubber bullets that's been sent to forensics.
Criminal proceedings under article 296 of the Criminal Code have been initiated in this regard.
A detainee is liable to 3 to 7 years ' imprisonment.
Let us recall that there was a shooting attack in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the vicinity of Tatarskaya Street on the night of 28 July.
Michelle Carter's sentence for reports that prompted Conrad Roy's suicide
A resident of Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for having used text messages and telephone calls to induce her boyfriend Conrad Roy's suicide.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months of her sentence in prison and another five years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the Thursday hearing, "My family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She was at risk of a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers stated that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the verdict standing by, squeezing her hands and putting her eyes down.
"By her actions, she killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her.
She didn't admit responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "tragic case she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that in his view her "age, maturity or even mental illness did not have a noticeable impact on her actions".
The Prosecutor read out statements from Roy Lynn Roy's mother saying, "Not a day has passed when I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I handle it - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Roy's sister Kamdin Roy said that she was relentlessly haunted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
"The man who's always been with me since I was born is the pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case is likely to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would make it a crime to advise a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The incident caught the attention of the entire country when it was revealed that he had been prompted to commit suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know how many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death while he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before she killed herself, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and, "You just need to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said Carter wanted attention through Roy's death, and prohibited her from talking to the press to prevent her getting what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers on this matter were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of killing her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Knox published her dissenting opinion in the Los Angeles Times, which stated, "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Eugeny Bogchev: "I let Langford go like a high-flying bird"
One of WTB's top single league basketball players, 33-year-old Keith Langford, left the UNICS.
The departure of the U.S. defender of News was commented by the president of UNICS Evgeny Bogachev.
Keith made this decision on family matters, told Yevgeny Bogachev.
He's got a little kid, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I've decided to meet him.
Of course, I could say no and renew his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played three seasons in the UNICS and showed a high level in each match, with 100 per cent being spent.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in family life and playing.
Keith Langford played in the Kazakh club for three years, winning the Silver of the United League 2015/16.
In the 2016–17 season, he received the Euroleague season's most successful player award.
He averaged 21.75 points per match.
This result is the second since 2004 when the award was established.
Langford, who won the award also in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to win the award more than once.
Langford will shortly sign a contract with Chinese Shenzhen, inform Eurohoops.
The American is expected to enter into a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroleague star in July to move to the Chinese championship.
Previously, the Chinese CBA had moved to the ex-central Panatinaikos by Jannis Burusis.
A sunburned tourist from Moscow was evacuated by helicopter to Adigei
Adygean rescuers today helicoptered an undersea tourist from the Republic's mountainous region, who received the strongest sunburns.
The man was resting at the Fisht shelter, 1,600 metres high.
A 27-year-old tourist had high blood pressure as well as difficulty breathing.
Pre-diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were approached by the tour leader, who said that the man had received burns on a camping trip.
Audi to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW announced that they would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman stated that the company believed that "there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions," with European cities in mind – including Munich, where the BMW is located – that were considering the possibility of banning or limiting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler stated on Thursday that it was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a review.
European automakers have been actively promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with carbon dioxide emission regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to auto manufacturers of diesel exhaust neutralization equipment is also increasing and it is becoming difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German automakers are under close scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of persuading influential car manufacturers and ignoring signs of a problem.
Companies try not to repeat Volkswagen's mistakes, which concealed the use of the so-called "damage device", which during testing could correct the amount of harmful gases emitted so that it conformed to the rules, but in normal driving conditions were shut down.
In the United States, several Volkswagen leaders were convicted, the rest being under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development team was arrested in Germany.
Former manager, Zakkeo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, is therefore not protected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was caught in a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded the investigation previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is the source of a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's income.
In Astrahani, a visitor to the cafe paid false money
The police received a report from a bank employee that a suspicious bill of 5,000 rubles had been discovered on the basis of a recalculation of money received from a public utility point.
A study conducted at the Forensics Center found it to be false.
According to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs for the Astrahan region, one of the visitors to the cafe who bought the Shaurma paid the bill.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device to determine the authenticity of the bills.
Police officers are currently identifying persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a knowingly false Russian CB ticket.
Such offences are punishable by up to 8 years ' imprisonment with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs encourages the inhabitants of the Astrahan region to be attentive to financial transactions; it is recommended that trade workers install devices to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers found a hell of a planet where even iron can melt.
Having first studied the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, the astrophysics were greatly surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that water molecules are so warmed up by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
Hubble's telescope captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature makes the water in the planet's atmosphere glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to so-called "hot Jupiter" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but located dozens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "terrestrial" days, and its gas casing is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens the lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but it is now feared that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda has grown worse due to arid weather and disease-borne insects; this has caused the constant headache of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the Provence-based Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM, says, "Lavanda in Provence is indeed at risk because in recent years this plant has experienced the effects of climate change: in the spring, and especially in the autumn, the rains have become much smaller.
This affects the life span of the lavender.
There are also small cicades jumping on the leaves by insects carrying microbacteria; into very dry weather they become very many."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very popular in perfumery and cosmetics.
Eric Shes says, "Instead of very long ears with many large colors, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened, or absent altogether.
So we have fewer parts containing ether oil."
The solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more drought-resistant varieties.
The Ambassador of Winter University 2019 met with the Red Sea students
Two-time World Hockey Champion, Ambassador of Winter University 2019 Alexander Semin met with beginners and gave autographs to fans the day before.
The meeting was held in the tent of Winter University 2019 as part of the theme week for puck hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could ride on a skating site with artificial ice.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games were organized with the performance of student game souvenirs, and a warm-up from the Federation of Aerobics.
Fifty schoolchildren attended the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much as possible at sports venues and stressed that the most important part of the initial stage of education was hard work and a huge desire to engage in hockey.
"It's great that there's a place in Krasnoyarsk like the tent of Winter University 2019 where beginners can directly ask questions to team coaches," said the champion.
Note that the ambassadors of Winter University 2019 help to promote student sports and healthy lifestyles among the Reds.
The campus tent will work throughout the summer season until September 25, reports the Press Service of the Winter University's 2019 directorship.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's remarks
U.S. Department of State spokesman Heather Nowert, commenting at the briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, stated the need to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
Such areas, she said, should be found to “enhance bilateral interaction”.
Nowert cited the Syria Armistice Agreement as an example of such successful cooperation.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
At the same time, Nowert refused to comment on Medvedev's claim of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said that, she certainly has the right to speak, but there's nothing more I can say on this subject," said the spokesman for the State Department.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of government of the Russian Federation Medvedev stated that Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that US sanctions would be in effect for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister, the American establishment, considers Trump's "purely beat".
The bodybuilder who disappeared in the undersea was found in someone else's house lost their memory.
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on 25 July under very piqued circumstances: he left the car's salon to go to the bathroom.
For seven days, he was searched for unsuccessfully by acquaintances and locals.
And there was Shamil at a stranger's house in Ramen.
He was found naked in his toilet by the owner.
The Dagestan athlete failed to explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was gone.
I.D. was helped by his missing persons.
Medical personnel arriving at the call recorded a partial memory loss and brain injury in Hanmetov, reports the Mash public.
There's probably other surprises waiting for the athlete.
The perpetrators of the kidnapping of Shamil were probably already in his apartment, the keys of which were also stolen from him.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion roubles
In fact, oil and gas revenues from July 2017 exceeded the estimate of 7.4 billion roubles, reports the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as explained by the agency, was due mainly to the higher exchange rate of the United States dollar to the ruble compared to the June average used for the valuation, as well as to the excess of actual gas production and oil exports projected levels.
"Deviation of federal oil and gas revenues from a monthly estimate consistent with the Federal Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is projected at +40.2 billion roubles in August 2017," says the Ministry of Finance report.
Thus, the total amount spent on the purchase of foreign exchange in the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign exchange will be equivalent to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign exchange purchases by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Each working day during the said period, the CB will enter into foreign exchange purchases on organized tenders by the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The foreign currency purchased will be credited to the Federal Treasury at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing danger in Mexico.
The weekly newspaper Riodose usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover recent violent crimes in Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug traffickers.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what appeared to be safer: taking children with them to an office where a grenade had already been thrown in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists for names for each column - evidence is not needed, suspicions and internal sensations will suffice.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being in the custody of the government or cartels, a whole list of scoundrels that make the work of covering the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not give any respite, and among the corpses that are multiplying in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 have been killed since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 have been under federal protection following attacks and threats; and this year, at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiration, co-founder of Riodes, Javier Valdes Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdes wrote in one of his many books on violent drug crimes.
His absence is felt very acutely, although his presence everywhere is a large photograph of Valdes showing his middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the front of the Riodes building; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smile, his face in glasses or his signature panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor ' s office had been set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases had been investigated, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with the majority of the thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organized crime committed each year, journalists ' killers are rarely brought to justice.
Riodose journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, though they are killed by grief, although it is now much more dangerous around them.
Without information about the killers, without justice from the safety talks at the meetings, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the Riodes office in Culiacane State Capital.
He was only able to drive a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolle was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot at him 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name - which means "The Twelfth River".
The shooter drove his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdes was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually split quickly on Kuliacan.
But most people don't talk about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions struggle to fill the resulting vacuum.
Let's not talk about one or more people being killed every day in the streets of Sinaloa, or about the cemetery being filled with decorated two-story mausoleums of drug kingships that are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that the state of calm is just when one of the cartels takes control of a seaside state with important ports and drug trafficking routes in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodose, was crushed by a sense of guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso López, the leader of one of the rival cartel factions that is fighting Guzman's sons.
The publication may have angered the sons; people believed to have been members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story was captured.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He was out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroest and in 2003 he founded Riodes with five colleagues, selling his $50 stock.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without touching on the subject of drugs," Bohorkes said.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publication, sales, and advertising revenues grew.
The journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted that they could read about what no one else dared write about in this publication.
Eight years after its founding, Riodes won the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Award for reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Award for courage in investigating Mexico's drug trade, wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to move on," he said at the CPJ award.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is a way of life, he said last October in an interview with Rompiento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist, either that or you're just fooling around."
I don't want to be asked, "What were you doing when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodose's staff miss Valdes, a joker who argued like a cargo man in a port, a friend, a generous hug and advice, a teacher who knew how to stay alive.
They relied on the order he had set up.
He always had to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask, "Is his love of a once-in-a-lifetime order ruining him?"
His death also led them to question their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like you to know about their wives, children, their legal business, and illegal airports for drug trafficking.
"These things were beyond the line," Bohorkes said.
The result, even in better times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says Riodose editor Andres Villareal, is that "sniffing can be fooled... and then what happened to Javier happens."
Old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling routes, weak government institutions, and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where the Riodes staff gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to bring cell phones: days before, it had become known that spyware, which was sold exclusively to Governments, was used in Mexico to track journalists and community activists.
Outside, two police officers hide in the shades of a tree from 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were commissioned by the state government to guard the Riodes office, which is located in a four-story building in the Kuliacan bourgeois district.
Some journalists asked for half a joke whether these policemen were part of the 50 per cent of the members of the order whom the Governor himself said could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to the mountainous area, which is de facto under the control of drug gangs.
The next issue of Riodos was about three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio César Chávez.
They also had to expose government spending concentrated in the Governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of Kuliacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the D.A.'s office.
Officially, it was not announced who had been abducted or how it happened, so caution had to be exercised when it came time to write about everyone in the city knowing that it was a favorite restaurant for drug dealers and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from public databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had dominated all levels of government for almost the entire past century.
Recently, a number of PRI governors were strongly accused of corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents at this restaurant, including when El Chapo's son Guzman escaped the military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for a column of Valdes with the most reliable information on the kidnapping.
"Before we knew what happened," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his skinny build called El Flaco.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken".
Valdes' cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the murders of journalists because staff have become what they never thought they would be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went the following morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office about another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacán State in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
Found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak out louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., seeking international support for the demand of justice in the Valdes case.
In a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez, she accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then requested that she no longer be assigned to cover the activities of the Government, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdés has said many times that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime, its accomplices in government and indifferent society.
In his last book, Drug Journalist, he wrote that reporters are not simply killed by drug gangs; they do so on the orders of politicians and security agencies in collusion with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 Press Protection Committee believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were ordered by police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez says.
Of course, killing scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Her body found a note supposedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel, "I'm here for my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her severed head.
Some publications chose to close as El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after killing her correspondent Miroslava Brich in March.
Others continue to hold on like El Manyana of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed drug cartels through an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or the country.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work and they still see danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work strike a daily balance between risky decisions.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits he's afraid to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, Riodos publishers sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left 19 confirmed dead bodies behind.
The war continued to ignite, as promised in a series of messages from cartels discovered in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted news on the Riodes website via their mobile phone.
The next day, we had to redo the first page.
The sirens weren't far off - another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes saw if the police guarding them were ready for defense.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was placed on display throughout Sinaloa, the Riodes staff continued his case.
"How can you think of closing," said Bohorkes, "if on the very day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her outside to do a story?"
Dinosaurus used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, though horrifying.
Researchers said that the first found remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhinoceros discovered by a Canadian miner survived so well that experts called it "Mona Lisa among dinosaurs".
It survived so well that they were even able to determine that the color of his scales skin was reddish brown – and to say that he had some sort of "dark past."
In a report published in Modern Biology magazine, it was described as "the best preserved of Tireophor in the history of finding and one of the best copies of dinosaur in the world."
It is a fossil – a recently found copy of a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the mercy period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good state stunned researchers, who call him "very remarkable."
This herbivorous thireophor is the best preserved fossil of this species in the history of the findings, according to articles in National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fanck when he was working at the Millenium mine of Sancore Company near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, in Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tirrella Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, an animal was found inside a 2,500-foot (1,100 kilograms) earth-grave.
Now that all this hard work has been done, the final result can be demonstrated.
"It's only worth a little squint, and you can almost believe he's sleeping," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tirrella Paleontology Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved copies of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa among dinosaurs".
In examining his skin, researchers found that it was herbivorous, even though it was covered with shell and resembled a walking tank, it appeared to have been exposed to considerable danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful shell-covered dinosaur used a red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as a protective colour, which many animals of our day also use.
This would allow him to blend faster into the environment and avoid encountering enemies, experts say, suggesting that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This creature, aged 110 million, belonging to the Nodosaurus family, was widely covered in the press in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tirrella Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and gave it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum labist Mark Mitchell, one of the band's members who spent over 7,000 hours behind his painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of scales and shell plates on his body.
They discovered a protective colour, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although protective colouring is common, the discovery became a surprise because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is much larger than the size of the now-lived animal with protective colour.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution chose to mask confrontation as a way of survival.
But most of today’s protected animals – such as deer, zebra, or armadillo – are much smaller and more accessible prey, indicating that the nodosaurus had to struggle seriously for survival.
"A serious threat from predators to a massive, massive dinosaur shell shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Mel Age were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur scales also indicates that its skin should have been reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, seeking information about his life, including the preserved contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he sank and his back down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to spread far deeper into the land than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scales skin, while at the same time remaining completely in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it looked then, in the Early Minor Period.
You don't need to use your imagination to recreate it, you just have to squint a little, and you can almost believe he's sleeping."
The mediocre period is an era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tyrannosaurus res, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, Tyreophor could have been hunted by one of his formidable ancestors.
These include acrocantosaurus, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 metres) long, weighing six tons.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after his death and mumified in the ile.
The creature was found by Sean Fanck when he was working at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, in Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to museum staff, this is the best preserved thieophore in the world, along with skin and shell, and it is intact, from the face to the femurs.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five metres) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes coming out of their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous thireophor was hard to walk on what is now Canada until the spilled river took it to the high seas.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its shell to the smallest detail.
The fossils of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover the bourgly shell plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the degree of security "is rare as winning the lottery".
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
Stoned skin remains still cover buffalo shell plates that sow the animal's skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, with five fingers turned up on it.
I can count scales on his sole."
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to enter Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who had previously led Georgia and then Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did so without proof of his identity and nationality.
Saakashvili's arrival is reported by the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his performance on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Warsaw Rebellion against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician did not know Polish, although he had tried to start a speech in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician referred to the topic of Georgia's cooperation with Poland, as well as to Ukraine.
That Ukraine's immigration service had stripped him of his citizenship, the opposable politician found out while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to fly the transatlantic flight without documents is not yet known.
Former governor of the Odessa region, Mikhail Saakashvili, had previously stated that his signature on the form for obtaining Ukrainian citizenship had been forged.
The politician stressed that he had not filled out any forms.
Investigating Weinziher and Olhovik extended until January
The pre-trial investigation in the case of Renova's co-owner Eugenia Olhovik and Energy Holding Head "T Plus" Boris Weinziher extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court is considering the extension of house arrest by the accused.
The representative of the UK at the meeting reported on the decision to extend the preliminary investigation for the last time.
“The special complexity and duration of the investigation are due to the need to seize and examine a large number of documents, as well as to carry out investigative activities in the territory of several constituent entities of the Russian Federation”, the investigator said.
He added that suspects regularly bribed Komi's leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziher, Olhovik, as well as former head of the “Integrated Energy Systems” ZUO, Mikhail Sloboddin, who until 5 September had been in charge of Wympelk, had been given bribes to senior officials of the Republic of Komi for imposing the most advantageous tariffs on thermal and electrical power, as well as for creating favourable business conditions.
Weinziher and Olhowick were detained, staged in Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Sloboddin escaped the investigation and was announced as a federal wanted man.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shocked to the bottom of her soul.
Only a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, a native of St. Louis sat on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, looking at a Facebook tape on the phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
It said, "Police just killed an 18-year-old child, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
Noticed that no one else on her tape posted this information, puzzled, she closed the Facebook and opened a tweet.
Her tape had many user interchanges with @TheePharoh.
Raper of Greater St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's lifeless body, spread across the street, where it would be located for four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrel thought.
But death wasn't something new to her and her circle.
She postponed her phone and later that night returned to tweets that people were gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of a signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a poster saying, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, pulled the trigger of the rifle and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals!"
"This is a non-standard situation," Ferrel said in her own memories.
"It's not a murder like the ones we're used to and can call typical.
I felt a chill at the time.
I was angry and crying."
She took a flight back and flew home the next day.
Upon landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson in the next almost three years was the subject of a new documentary film, Whose Streets?, which will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, strength and resilience from the perspective of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was on her way to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and wreath according to color, they recalled a conversation that had been held countless times before this morning, "the experience of blacks and their position".
She recalls saying, "Do you remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now because a policeman killed an 18-year-old boy, and it was wrong."
"I couldn't help but take her," Ferrel said later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what has happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be raised on it.
It must not only have a good understanding of activism and organization, it must also understand the different levels of black experience and their positions and what we must do to become free to be free.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd do her a bad favor if I could keep her out of it."
When they arrived at Ferguson, they made the first stop on South Florida Road, on a site across the street from a police station that became some sort of tent camp while activists waited for reports of the resulting innocence of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrel and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was making lunch packs.
They collected bags and helped to distribute them to protesters.
Little in Ferrel's mind, he found a form of a new type of activism.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis, she was president of the Association of Hygienic Students, members of national minorities, and was involved in food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
"I had no organizer experience.
It came on its own."
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrel met Sabaa Folayan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said she and her chief operator Lucas Alvarado-Farraer "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrel came up with the question, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?"
This skepticism was inspired by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and endurance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson are not in the spotlight, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already teamed up with her co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for her activism on death row issues.
His involvement aroused sympathy for the project at Ferrel and six other local residents with whom the team of the Project Whose Streets? kept in touch for years after Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was the most important thing to me, as these people will be represented, because it is the way I will be represented myself."
And although the project's goal was not to focus on Ferrel's experience at all – in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the lifeguard leader, but about how the community unites," as Folayan said – it turned out to be the most open of the film's participants.
As a result, whose streets? shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrel's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrel, laughing about the first time I saw a finished product.
"But I realized that when you do such work and humanize blacks, there must be some level of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrel's history again discusses and highlights the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Life movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after killing a black teenager, Trevon Martin, in 2012 – identify themselves as homosexuals.
"Black homosexual women in leadership positions support all this movement," Ferrel says. "But all because we're constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden."
Folayan accepted this claim, noting that "movement is in fact supported by black women and many homosexual black women."
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination", and that Ferrel was not selected as the film's central character due to its distinctive features.
"She was the man who awakened this energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that she's in the first place because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, there have been no cameras in Ferguson for a long time, but there remain complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be on probation for closing the highway during the demonstration for another two and a half years.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of a place called home, just: "Bardak".
She's still holding on to the talk she learned when she went to Ferguson Street full three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
Two Salvadoran football players disqualified for biting U.S. players
El Salvador footballers Henry Romero and Darwin Serena received long-term disqualifications for unsporting behaviour.
During the quarter-final match of the Golden Cup of the Confederations of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), Salvadorans bit American players.
Henry Romero's defender was the first to excel.
The Salvadorian bit Josie Altidore, the attacker, then pinched him by the chest.
Serena's midfielder then bit U.S. defender Omar Gonzalez when pitching the corner in his penalty square.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Serena for six.
The meeting itself ended with a 2–0 American victory, transmitting Goal.com.
A similarity emerges: the artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the hall at the Friedman Gallery in New York City, faces of people, white, black and brown, all of which are elusively similar to each other, hang from the ceiling on the wire.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent clippings from Fort Levenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year term for the famous broadcast of confidential diplomatic telegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called "The Origin of Similarity".
This is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey Harbor, whose art unites technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a female transsexual and famous dissident, to whom Barack Obama reduced his sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analysing through the computer program the DNA obtained from Manning and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of persons who could have had such a genome, Dewey Harborg created a profound, though not easy to perceive, manifesto not only about the plasticity of DNA data - different ways of interpreting them and the ingenious determinism of these interpretations - but also about identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but from an adolescent age openly said that she considered herself a woman, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 episodes, including six violations of the espionage act, computer fraud, and theft.
Her photographs in prison were unavailable, so only one photo of her was known: a grainy black and white selfie, on which Manning in platinum shade wig, clearly feeling awkward, sits at the wheel of the car; with this photograph, she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg successfully completed his 2012 "Vision of Strangers".
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence such as butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a preliminary screening of a new press exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait created from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prison muse became correspondence friends and exchanged several letters over two years.
They even wrote a comic book of "Depressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who depicted how in the future the president would ease Chelsea's punishment and she would be able to visit the exhibition in person.
That Obama really decided to free Manning just a few days after the book was released was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong about the exhibition opening right now, when Donald Trump declares war on people who reveal secret information in the government, and invents new ways to incite on Twitter animosity that he is meant to soften.
When Dewey Harbor was asked about the coincidence of all of this over time, she said, "There's no such thing as an accident."
In an artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's huge signature below (with a heart instead of a point over "i" in her name) calls for an end to "automated separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of penciled C, G, and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist is scientifically elegantly expressed), Dewey Harborg hoped to show how remarkably similar we are, at least in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how much genetic data are open for interpretation and how subjective it is," Dewey Harbor said; her 2007 video work, False Memories, is also displayed here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of an exhibition that fits in one room is the above-mentioned novel in comic books.
It features King Kong-style Manning over the U.S. Correctional Casar building with a loudspeaker in hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it says.
"So don't ever shut up."
"It's a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me," says the artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person - as it was visionaryally depicted in comic books - but when she comes, she will be greeted by masks in the middle of the room, her own genomic simulacs gathered like crowds of protesters.
It's also done intentionally, like everyone at the exhibition up to height (5"2, Manning's height), where the pencil painted genetic haplogroups.
"I'd hang them on walls earlier, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," Dewey Harbor says about portraits.
"I wanted them to look like a mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like a movement that stood behind her release."
Professors at Northwestern University and Oxford University staff member are wanted by the police on murder charges
According to police reports, there is a nationwide raid on a professor at Northwestern University and a staff member at Oxford University who are wanted as suspects because a man was found stabbed to death in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the Cook County Court's records, warrants were issued on Monday for premeditated murder without the right to be released on bail of forty-four-year-old Wyndam Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranlo, twenty-six, died after being stabbed multiple times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead at the crime scene, and now detectives are investigating the death from the stab wounds, considered her murder, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Latham has served as Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan C. Kabbage, vice president of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail application that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was not allowed to enter Northwestern University campuses.
"Now this is a criminal case being investigated by authorized persons, and Northwestern University cooperates with the investigation," said Kabbaj.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
University spokesman and Somerville College stated in an e-mail statement: "We have been in contact with the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to US investigative agencies."
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
Chicago Police Chief of Communications Anthony Gulelmi said he strongly advises suspects to surrender to their organs.
"Police have suggestions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensifying," Gulelmi reported.
According to Gulelmi, local, regional and federal authorities assist in the search for suspects.
According to Gulelmi, the police were called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene a terrible crime scene.
Gulelmi reported that it was unclear whether the incident itself occurred on 27 July.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirmed that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim were connected," Gulelmi said.
The Grand Plaza manuals issued a call to visitors, which reported: "Police are currently working on the timeline of the incident, gathering information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Russian Vice Prime Minister Mutko: "We will fulfil the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future"
Russian vice-premier Vitaly Mutko said that the terms of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) set for the resumption of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be fulfilled shortly.
"A certain stage in compliance has been passed, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct tests with UKAD (British Anti-Doping Agency).
WADA's road map was updated accordingly," said Mutko on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map to restore compliance with the Code, which listed the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA's work and had recently been published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could represent difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the requirements on the list implies that Russian andidoping structures should publicly recognize the results of an inquiry commissioned by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, alleging that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
On this point, Mutko said, "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has malfunctioned.
All measures have been taken.
But there was no government program, and we won't admit what didn't happen."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
The same morning, in an interview with the Russian newspaper Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged earlier problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added, "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept the report without reservation," added Smirnov.
WADA suspended RUSADA from conducting doping controls in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June this year, it was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the organization's Moscow office in July, the CEO of WADA, Olivier Niggli, stated that RUSADA was "walking in the right direction" to restore its work.
There's a fire in the 79-story tower in Dubai.
The major fire that occurred in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, extinguished, transmits Reuters.
It is noted that the firefighters managed all fire fires by 4 a.m. local time (3.00 msc).
Local authorities reported that no one had been injured in the incident.
At the time of the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed.
The reasons for what happened are not yet known.
The 79-story residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, was previously reported to be on fire in Dubai.
All the tenants were evacuated in time.
Buzova's unimaginable outfit shocked fans: pants that don't cover underpants
The Scandal reality show host "Doom 2" Olga Busov struck the spectators of the Europa Plus Live Festival with dancing in their underwear.
In front of thousands of fans, the newest duo singer with Nastia Kudri performed the song "We'll Be Hot".
Both girls went to the stage in provocative "brutes" sewn in such a way that the singers' underwear was in plain sight.
Buzova and Kudry inscriptions were made on the trousers.
Earlier, it was reported that a specialist from a Moscow plastic surgery clinic commented on the changes in the appearance of Busova.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
This was reported by Radio 4 on Friday, August 4, citing foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Generalsack also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and "destabilization in eastern Ukraine".
Stoltenberg assured, however, that dialogue with Russia was still possible and that a further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump stated that US-Russia relations were dangerously low, and accused the American Congress of doing so.
Ekaterinburg Metro is learning a new way of paying
In October, it will be possible to pay for a trip to the Ekaterinburg Metro with a bank card, as stated by Paul Vedernnikov, CEO of the I-Net OAO in an interview with the Ostrobothnia Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce the same metro fare system for the 2018 World Cup as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, Mundial guests, to take advantage of the metro with their bank cards without acquiring badges or standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not to become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among his startup staff in electronic commerce, but the polls did not work.
Answers were often vague, useless, or worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees didn't trust the process.
"He was never consistent and objective," Herrett told the manager of a 75-man company in San Francisco, Madison Reed, engaged in e-commerce in hair care.
She therefore sought the assistance of third parties.
A new type of staff startup is now emerging, which helps companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software whose purpose is to measure staff involvement, they allow companies to make rapid inquiries, to contact certain teams and demographic groups, to offer staff anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases to allow informants to pass the top management and to contact the office directly.
"Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, and where is Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the Glint startup from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
Herrett told me that she had reached a better understanding of what her staff thought and felt in three years of use of "Glint".
In addition to express interviews and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers the company's thermal map and shows in visual form which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, allowing it to understand why.
Companies are slightly aware that they need to control the workplace, otherwise they will become another Uber involved in a scandal when a former employee published a blog post describing an aggressive environment in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for a profitable business.
The Internet portal Let's Talk About Pay, dedicated to financial technology, estimates that the global governance, regulation, and conformity industry may cost over $118.7 billion by 2020.
The Convercent startup from Denver, Colorado, helping companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year against the backdrop of a fall in Uber's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently emerged among clients.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send individually commissioned staff opinions, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go straight to the board.
"Court of public opinion intercepted power from inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If a company is found to be ill-treated by employees or to behave unethically, even if inspectors do not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by customers, staff outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan reported.
"Ruby Tuesday", a chain of restaurants with over 25,000 employees working in 500 establishments, used Convercent for over a year to make sure that employees were aware of the rules and procedures, and to offer a simple way to contact the company's head office.
Previously, if a staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for a telephone number or a head office email, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
Often it was a frightening and awkward experience, reported James Vitrano, the chief of law at Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company uses the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment, and unfair pay – can be quickly discovered and dealt with.
"I can approach a holistic, comprehensive understanding of staff situation," Vitrano said, who runs the "Ruby Tuesday" network risk management team.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with staff".
According to Queensland, companies began to take staff ethics, values and involvement more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed due to ethical irregularities as a result of Del Enron.
But it was only when the social media became widespread that the companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from viral distribution on the network.
"Before beginning to use technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies regularly for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that has been endorsed by venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received funding of $10 million from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from the Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The increasing volume of research shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In hard-to-competition markets such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, that is just the minimum.
Staff members want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to companies with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work with the company, they feel they are heard, and that the work they do results, they try more to make such a company a success," says Nina McQueen, vice president for global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors earn income when companies' portfolio business goes well; companies' business goes well when employees are loyal and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase staff loyalty and involvement, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to workplace cultural experts, it is important to have data on staff involvement.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks staff for feedback, it may give the impression that change is coming.
And if change does not take place quickly enough, or at all, disappointment may develop, and staff will lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 offers, you have to be ready to have 4,000 interviews," says Russell Rat, president of the management consulting firm Kotter International, who had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't go to the end, the staff will wonder, "Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Herrett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly staff interviews, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem with "Glint".
And, after collecting feedback from staff dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday acquires new knowledge of its employees and hopes that in the long run this knowledge will help it to better retain staff in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose company.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt is opened on the prospectus of Krasnoarmey.
In Barnaul, crucial measures were taken to address the cause of the asphalt failures on the prospectus of Krasnoarmei.
The place where holes appeared twice on the newly paved carriageway (the intersection with Youth Street) is decided to be "opened".
Let us recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tramways was due to the loss of land in the area of the homeless unexploited network.
According to Ivan Garmat, Vice-Chairman of the City Committee on Road, Upgrading, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be carried out for detailed survey and elimination of the fall conditions.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is anticipated that the re-establishment and concreteization of the no-host communications section will be required.
This is reported on the official website of the provincial capital.
Bruins team has to work longer because the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day.
Time is approaching 11:00 p.m.; a crowd of football players from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to chat on one side of the team's new training fields located on campus.
Some of them pulled their T-shirts, exposed their backs, shiny from sweat after a tense first day of sports camp.
For many players in the team, these minutes of idleness constitute a break in the middle of the day.
Players recorded for summer classes, after a three-hour training, will go back to dormitories to prepare for final exams, and the next morning will return to Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6:30 p.m.
Shortly before Monday turned on Tuesday, Bruins team coach Jim Maura said, "The next three days these guys are waiting for a meatcut."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the burden on players, actually extended their working hours – at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training sessions of the California University team in Los Angeles was scheduled at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate them in an already tight player schedule.
The side effect of the absence of two trainings a day was more days with one training, and Bruins moves the start of the camp by almost a week compared to last year and conducts training during summer school for the first time in six seasons in Maura in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they are expected to conduct 18 training sessions through August 20, before starting official preparations for the first game in the season against the Texas University A&M team in September.
Maura said he supported the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite it having resulted in another item on the player's tight schedule.
"For three or four days we give them this enormous burden, this is a serious test," Maura said.
"And they've just overcome it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think that when we live until Saturday and we have more time, it'll be really great."
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make training closed; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view with an adjacent parking lot and from a nearby Laskin Centre, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded by football balls that have crossed the safety net behind the gates.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Maura admits that when rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
"We'll have security," Maura said.
"It's a serious problem, and I don't exaggerate the danger by suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and tape the training on video.
If you have a video recording of your training, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security in parking lot number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan."
All victims of the terrorist attack in Petersburg are discharged from hospitals
All casualties during the St. Petersburg Metro attack in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported to the press service of Lieutenant Governor Anna Mitianina.
According to the end of July, there were three people left in the hospital, transmitting the TV Center.
Let us recall that the explosion on the St. Petersburg Metro took place on 3 April this year.
The bomb was detonated by a suicide bomber, Akbarjon Jalilov.
The attack killed 15 people, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer, Abor Azimov, were arrested.
As will be recalled, on the previous day Rospornadzor recommended that the Metro of Petersburg review the transport security plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook reinforces fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of mystifications to independent experts and show their opinions under original posts, announced on Thursday the world's largest social network that tries to fight so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystifications, send them to check them out and possibly show the results of fact-checking under the entry post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue is also under active debate in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports prior to the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before the September elections, support was expressed for a plan to fine social media if they did not quickly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported testing a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which messages are contested by independent verifiers, people want to have a broader context to make reasonable judgements about what they read and what they share," wrote Sarah Sue, a Facebook news tape manager in her cell block.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "linked articles" and work on other changes in the news feed to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a comic book novel: One castle in English History
In the recent past, Scottney's tiny castle was shot in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s served as a shelter for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the Buhl River Valley in Kent County, he watched a turbulent story around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a smoked hair and a propensity for historical documents, for a comic book novel.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says with enthusiasm.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers a period from the Middle Ages to the Ewardian era and tells of families who lived in Scotland; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists, Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote Dead Man's Teeth and Other Stories, a compilation of British Library documents; this project suddenly touched him to the bottom of his soul.
"I could just be touched by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for Jacobites," he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell like smoke, because at those times the lights were on.
And in 300 years, in the future, you think you're there, too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a man caught in this passion for old papers, getting support from the National Foundation and the English Art Council and living in the castle for four months ("I'm a little bit stuck there") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the "new" Victorian castle all day, walked through the archives, and considered numerous treasures of the estate and old things - such as the heads of hyenas on walls or bottles that had been in the ditch for centuries.
He was walking around the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to rangers, gardeners, and sometimes with artists working on illustrations of his book.
Then at night, he "drinked whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scotland Castle is not very well studied, because the National Foundation did not gain full access to it until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hassie, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the employees were just beginning to deal with the archive, which he describes as "that the aristocrats have gone to the attic for centuries."
Diary, British Empire letters, maps showing who owned what, "You think land disputes are boring," Rhodes says, "but this bereza was fought by two families.
It happens like this, guys!"
In some of the compilation's stories, the castle becomes the starting point for broader explorations in English history: e.g. at the Worker, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
"There is evidence of a riot that occurred at the castle in 1380, in a book called the Knights Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes says.
"The Bristian uprising started in these places, and I thought the riot was a good start.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other stories are strongly linked to the history of the castle, such as the Priest, which tells of the Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family has been hiding for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Contrabandist", about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by stoned the coffin (it was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of all who inhabited Scottie: "Gentlemen seem to have been a perfect con artist, always getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women - I imagine them as a company of handsome men who can care for the heirs of great fortunes."
After completing his job at Castle, Rhodes is looking for other possibilities to get a unique writing experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elamyanmäki, a place where in the early 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it grew back into forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: damn it, I have to go back to real life again."
The top 15 banks pick Rossia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, WTB, WTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FC Open, seven other credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, organizations graduating from the ARB will account for at least 80 per cent of the market.
But this is not just a solution - all banks that have declared a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that brings together credit institutions, the Association of Regional Banks “Russia”, led by a well-known politician, Anatoly Aksakow, chairman of the Committee of the State Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by the way, by the last session and the most effective head of the Duma Committee and deputy in terms of the number of bills drafted.
The outbreak of the conflict within the ARB was initiated during the discussion in the Federation Council, when new bills were considered by the Interregional Banking Council, in particular involving a new classification of banks according to the size of the statutory capital.
Garegin Tosunian, the president of the ARB, then stated that the association believed that the bill was being passed for the benefit of the largest banks, which thus attempt to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other claims included criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunian, does not always justify withdrawing licences from some banks, which was, however, objected to by a representative of the CD: many of the directors of the fined banks, in particular Vneshprombank, were on the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a highly sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment has become a visible reason for fifteen major banks to start preparing themselves for membership of the Association Russia, stating that “the effectiveness of the ARB will be low and constructive dialogue within the banking community is virtually non-existent”.
The contributors will be better off.
How's this gonna end?
Answer immediately the main question that arises in the slightest banking breakdown or conflict or near it: investors are not in any danger, rather, the credibility of the banking system will be enhanced.
He leads Rossia Anatoly Aksakow, known for his sensitivity in all the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: virtually all the CB leadership is present at the association's annual events, and all significant regulatory legislative initiatives go through expert assessments of the “regions”.
At the human resources and organizational level, there is obviously no particular shock.
There is no doubt that the ARB finds itself in a difficult financial and management situation after losing such powerful and influential actors with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, in this oldest, established in 1991, there is considerable potential for the banking community to continue to improve banking legislation and monetary management in general.
Nor can it be said that Russia's open-ended association is prepared to accept new members on any terms, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoli Aksakova ("may wish too much"), who, as early as 21 July at a briefing at the parliamentary newspaper press centre, stated that "literally the following day, representatives of the ARB banks asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our association Roscia."
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Council of the Association, as well as to give more attention to new banking technologies.
A negotiation process is under way, proposals from both sides are being examined, and the agenda for an extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, to be held in Sochi in mid-September in the framework of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll figure it out.
Anatoly Aksakow, stressing that "the chair is not holding", also called the possible new leader of Russia's renewed association, Georgi Luntovsky, who leaves the office of Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, giving a high profile of his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently resting in Crimea, plans to suspend his leave for one day and to arrive in Moscow, at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association of Russia, which is scheduled to consider the agenda of the extraordinary convention of Russia.
There will be no restrictions on the entry of petrol-powered cars into major cities in Russia
Deputy head of the Ministry, Nikolai Asaul, stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of petrol-powered cars into major cities in Russia would not be restricted for the time being.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is to gradually raise the ecological class.
And that's where the concept goes straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, since what year?
That's a catchphrase, let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Shall we close the whole city?
"In 20 years -- I don't know, maybe that's what's going to happen," says the minister's Prime.
The Newspaper had previously reported that by 17 August, Vice-Premier Arkady Dvorkovich had been assigned to examine proposals on possible options for powering electric transport submitted to the Government by PAO CEO KamAZ Sergei Koggin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, are the use of vehicles with DWS in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump has stated that a new U.S. immigration plan will be adopted, which will change the rules for getting a Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so by changing how the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law would reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide advantages to candidates who own English, have the money that allows them to support themselves, and possess the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said, according to the American media.
The appearance of sex robots is real, and that should bother us.
Before we could think that 2017 could no longer get worse, a new report on technological advances in sex robot production came out.
Yeah.
Sex robots are in the spotlight right now.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5 to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FR, we must take their emergence seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of robot eyes, the shape of nipples, and the type of nails.
"People giggle about it, but firms already send them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we'll see a lot more of them," said Sharkey at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls evolved from their inflatable fellow robots into robots with silicone skin warm to touch, and with almost human lines that artificial intelligence controls.
Users can also customize their robots in their own way, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "face" in comparison to which Stepford's wife would seem very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to customize in robots the qualities they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxy Gold sex robots developed by the True Company, which are supplied with an already programmed individuality - e.g. Cold Farrah makes the impression of being shy, and Dekai Wendy has a "bold" character.
"Roxxy Gold has a character that fits perfectly with yours," the True Companion website enthusiastically reports.
So she loves what you love, doesn't like what you don't like, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day, like a real man!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may be in the mood!"
In the emergence of sex robots, much is disturbing - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most concerned is the subordinate image of a woman, an association with rape, which causes Cold (read: resisting) Farah to possess.
On True Companion, Roxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex with subordination as an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture for the time being.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are neither bad nor aggressive until the free market gives them an opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence that these complicated sex robots came about precisely when women's rights around the world were threatened when the White House had a president who boasts of being hard on women.
The worst part of the television series "Speaks of the Handmaid" is not graphic images, twisted bodies, and out-of-eyes, namely, how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem that big now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical semblance of real women (only with proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to look like people to feel, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's their "characters" that don't look like real women.
They cannot break up with or leave their partners.
They don't have a life or a biography-- nothing that could point to independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
Los Angeles native Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has played for Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on 31 August.
This was reported in an interview to BeBasket portal by the general manager of the "blue-yellow" Andrei Lebedev.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately, he's not coming in for family reasons.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide an opportunity for our young players to develop," he said.
I recall that with Jeter's direct involvement, the Ukrainian team peaked at number six on Eurobasket 2013 and first entered the World Basketball Championship, where the yellow-blue could not overcome the group stage, and the U.S. native averaged 15.4 points per game, 3 rebounds and 5 assists.
Jeter has ceased to compete for Ukraine since he retired as head coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left the position in 2015.
The men's Eurobasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Finland, Turkey, Romania and Israel.
The Ukrainian team will hold their group tournament matches on Earth promised.
Eugenia Murzin's wards in Group B will have five fights: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two test fights, in which the Dutch and Belarusians gave way.
Trump's great feat?
Playing Mita Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Trump era, a common place was the fact that political disputes polarizing the American electorate at the micro level shattered some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the American newspapers spun columns about how to deal with terrible relatives voting for Trump.
I think we're all so tense that we're about to burst.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left-wing poet from Chicago, who had been on knives with Republicans in her family for a long time, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
At Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including a Republican brother with whom she has argued politics for decades, suddenly and strangely ended up on the same side.
At dinner, that is certainly good; but I cannot help but think that in a broader context it may be quite dangerous.
Trump inhaled power into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his reign could move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we'll be stopped from being struck by his actions.
However, there is an even more questionable scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans who, against his standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself missing Mitt Romney's old-fashioned craziness today - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax returns looked like) - compared to Trump and both seem like a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will have enough to be in his mind to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department's household and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and enormous, the pictures of glass fiber on the central drum are grim clowns and animals, which, when curved in horror, look at their backs, are extremely sinister, and the sounding music, oddly enough, is exhilarating.
So many well-known things in this city are disappointing: skyscraper views become obsolete, buildings' silhouettes have too come too much to stir awe, and the reality of the city fails to keep pace with the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still worried about the day I found out that the Suisse cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (the theme pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" isn't counting) but a big circular intersection in Northern London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, an 11-year-old child and two women in 40 can have a great time.
If I could score the carousels, I'd score an A, but luckily, no one asked me to.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to run a terminal card, evaluate my "experience" purchases on a scale of one to five stars.
In a coffee shop on the corner of my street, the same plus the option of a 15% tea score is for an order at the counter.
As a result, not only does neutral interaction slow down, but it also has to be personalized in a situation that does not imply it.
The poor shop girl at the department store smiled confusedly while I was tired of assessing my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pains
Pistorius leaves prison for a second visit to a doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to hospital for the treatment of wrist cuts, which the prison administration claims he suffered as a result of a fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal from the Public Prosecutor's Office against an initial conviction for manslaughter.
He killed Stenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the door of the toilet room in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius stated that he took his friend for a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The Public Prosecutor's Office announced its intention to lodge another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretoria, which she said was too soft.
The Attorney General ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be heard this year.
Pretorius' term may be increased by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspected of beating up a NTV journalist elected a non-exit subscription
Metropolitan law enforcement officers chose a restraining measure in the form of a non-exit subscription for a man who had attacked a NTV journalist, Nikita Razozev, during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on 2 August.
This is reported by the TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Irina Wolf.
“In the context of the investigation of a criminal case brought under article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (Battery) against a 32-year-old man who struck the face of a correspondent of a television channel in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation of Gorky, the suspect has been selected as a preventive measure in the form of a non-exit and proper conduct”, the Wolf clarified.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that the suspect had been the subject of an administrative report for police disobedience.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast, a drunk man approached the correspondent on WV Day and hit him in the face.
As it turned out later, the bully had nothing to do with the VDP.
According to Duzzhev himself, the paratroopers, on the other hand, tried to apprehend the Moscowman.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal parking.
According to BBC, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people were detained in Sitonia, supplying tents in an undeployed location, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed BBC that Bulgarian citizens were then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and already impose severe fines on anyone caught while parking in an untargeted location.
The checks will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court could impose a fine.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused the U.S. Vice President of the cold war rhetoric.
Statements made during the U.S. Vice President Michael Pence's European tour have been criticized by the Russian MID.
"It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly falling into primitive, ideologically motivated cold war strains, which are completely detached from reality," says the Russian foreign policy statement.
Thus, in MIDE, they responded to Pens' words about the “Russian threat” and attempts to forcibly redraw the borders he had said in Podgorica.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed to the destructiveness of the choice of “or with the West, or with Russia” and the unobvious theory of the alleged non-alternative entry of all South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to exclude Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“Call upon American colleagues to stop the trampling of Russia and its foreign policy, which is always based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests”, says the statement of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The paramedic was injured in an ambulance accident in Podskovje
The accident occurred in the Moscow Stupino, and a paramedic was injured in a collision between a foreign cart and an ambulance.
Today around 08:10 msk there was a collision of Mitsubishi's car with an ambulance in Stupino, Moscow.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance turned upside down," said TASS at the Ministry of Internal Affairs Press Service for the Moscow Region.
Law enforcement officers were working on the scene, and the circumstances of the incident were being clarified.
In Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son into a cellofan bag at the construction site.
On the evening of 3 August, the Divisional Police Department received a report from a local resident that he had found a bag of a baby in an unbuilt private house.
“Law enforcement and doctors have gone to the scene and brought the child promptly to a medical institution”, reported in the Odessa chapter of the National Police.
The medical team determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of a cord.
In the course of priority operational and investigative activities, the identity of a woman born in childbirth was established: a 36-year-old local woman.
It is also established that a woman has three other young children.
As noted in the chapter, the law enforcement family had not previously been identified or specifically registered.
The police force was currently identifying the circumstances and reasons that had compelled the woman to do so, and a procedural decision would then be taken.
The baby is now under medical supervision.
As previously reported, in Nikolayev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into a garbage can.
Gregory Leps: "I'm going to fight, though 55 isn't 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian entertainer Gregory Leps is celebrating his 55th birthday the next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer spoke with News columnist.
I remember when you celebrated your "half."
Special tent at the Luzhniks, Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
I bet you'd like to spend your next five-year-old.
Did the designs come true?
Speaking of profession, it was a good time.
I've been working hard, touring the country three times, giving 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not what I was, say, 20 years ago.
Biological clocks can't be fooled.
Singing as I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
Still, I'm going to fight, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
You're recording a new album with them, the first in three years.
Yeah, we're working on it right now.
In fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio, and now we're sending him to a meeting in Los Angeles.
It's called "Why are you so serious?" by a song of the same name written with Timati.
She's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we put a video on her.
And we'll introduce the album in November to a series of my jubilee concerts at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow.
Your new record was handed by a great American drummer, Chris Coleman.
Do you think you wanted to get him into your touring squad?
I think Coleman is one of the world's most outstanding drummers today.
He came to my studio to record his parties.
I asked him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a known drummer involved in various projects. - News) offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to say the least, excessive conditions.
It was about fees ranging from 35,000 to 45,000 per month.
Then I thought I'd find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space as well.
And I found a great drummer, Max Baby.
It's better to feed your own (smiles) at all.
Sometimes I want to pick on one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
He is written about by Western music magazines and invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wei, after hearing his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists, with another performing technique, has come."
Your album is down in Los Angeles, American musicians cooperate with you, but you still can't come to the United States?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
Now, to be honest, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who are dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry I can't get into America.
I've said that I study there many times.
The more you talk to real professionals, the more useful it is.
We're no dumber than them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
For 70 years, our artists of popular music have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always done.
They sought the best possible sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has refused me entry for ten years.
But I'm still gonna apply for a visa every year to the British embassy to be allowed to go there again, and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe is kind to me.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a custom one, but a poster, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo, and I've been there once before.
Now we've been invited again, and as far as I'm concerned, all the tickets to the concert have been sold out.
Do you want to go to Lima Wykul's Runway, which will start on July 20 in Jurmal?
She invited me, and I certainly responded.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a gorgeous woman who can present herself with beautiful vocals and even whispers.
After touring and jubilee concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to Vladimir Vysocki's art once.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When's the third?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be totally different.
I want to record about 80-90 of Vysocki's songs in about the same pitch as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
I'll have our famous musician Timur Vedernnikov accompanies me.
I'll try to get Alexander Jakovlevich Rosenbaum to participate in the album.
I've been talking to him about this, and we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it works.
You and Boris Grebenchikov's songs have gradually been introduced into your repertoire.
Why don't you write an album of his stuff later?
Boris Borisovich is a great man and a great musician.
I've crossed paths with him several times and asked him, "Can I sing one of his songs?"
He said, "Grigory, I write songs to be performed."
Please try, sing.
I think it's interesting to have an album like this.
I don't have a similar task yet, but in the future, a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't object, I might make a project like this.
If you don't focus entirely on your production center.
I suppose until you realized his potential, you didn't sign any of the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of artists I'd dream of having under my wing, but they're independent, built-in people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Serezha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And now there's Alexander Panayotov in my center, who I've been driving in Voice.
We made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be a shame if he didn't reach the heights he deserved.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, make videos.
I hope it's a good result.
I also try to promote other artists in my center: buy them songs, pay the poets, sometimes their tracks get caught in the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they don't reach a great height, I'm still going to bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On their way out, they'll get a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want to, they can go their own way, and I won't insist that they return their money.
Although it would be a pleasure if one of them made a commercial success and paid me the percentages we agreed to in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not gonna shut down anyone's oxygen.
Let everyone work, break through, prove what I once proved.
If you're offered a tour of Ukraine tomorrow and guaranteed entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited.
These are mainly private activities.
And as for the big tour...
I was a man of my country, a Russian, of my own conviction, flying to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If they say tomorrow we have to go somewhere else in the interests of the state, I'll go.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that we have had this situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we're one people and we have to be together.
I'm sorry it's not likely to happen, at least for a while.
I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We've met like nowhere else.
A very grateful audience.
And with several Ukrainian artists, Ani Lorak, Light Loboda, Artem Loic...
In Ukraine, there are a lot of gifted people, and it is truly regrettable that they cannot now fully vent their talent into a wide Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as Slava Vakarchuk, and make a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at the moment...
Andrei Ochatkov was thrown from the cosmodrome.
As IA has become known, the technical director of the East Andrei Oslamkov Cosmodrome has begun to work at the Khrunishev State Space Production Centre (HCNC).
He had previously been de facto involved in the construction of the East Cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Land and Space Infrastructure Operations Centre (CENCI), he had been transferred to a plant in the Moscow Philosophies, where he would coordinate production.
Mr. Ochatkov will not have a replacement: the position of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the function is dispersed to the units of the CENCI.
That the technical director of the Eastern and Deputy Director-General for Technological Development of the CENCI, Andrei Oslamkov, had moved to work at the Hrunishev GCN, IA told top managers of several space industries, as well as a government official.
"He's been working in a new post for weeks," said the "I" interlocutors in the industry.
It was not possible to get the CENTI's operational comment on Thursday, and Mr. Oslamkov himself was not available for comment.
However, I've officially confirmed the information to HKNPC.
He decided to move to the position of Director of Production Coordination, stated at the plant. - Andrei Oslamkov has fully fulfilled his mission to provide a launch minimum for the first launch at the East Cosmodrome.
Mr. Ochatkov went to work at the CENCI in 2013, having served behind his back in space forces, particularly in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk, he served as the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel at the “north” cosmodrome.
In 2009, Andrei Oslamkov became a criminal subject.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly from his application, regional traders were paid for the backs of State orders, but failed to comply with the obligations undertaken to clean separated parts of the carrier rockets in the Arangela region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
Its technological development responsibilities in the CENCI have been extended to various projects, but the construction of the Far East Cosmodrome has been the main one.
The head of the then Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostupenko, in an interview with IA, explicitly said that the state of affairs in East "was critical as early as October 2013".
The fact is that the planning was a strategic error: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were planned for the same time, at the end of 2015.
In order to launch before the end of the year, the construction was decided six months earlier and the dates were changed from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, it had to be a trick: CENCI specialists had begun to install technology equipment in unbuilt facilities in parallel.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrei Oslamkov.
Despite the risks that existed and the transfer did occur (instead of December 2015 the Soyuz did not leave until April 28, 2016), this idea was justified, says the source "I" on the cosmodrome: "We would not have made a single launch with the East until now, but we would have been building."
Vice Premier Dmitri Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Oslamkov his "space Susanin", but he was the one who almost always requested information about the construction's progress.
Mr. Ochatkov remembered and was straightforward: for example, in an interview with IA, he suggested that the Federal Special Construction Agency (Spexstra) should be stripped of its status as the only performer in East and work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we put all our eggs in one basket of Special Construction?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, the CENCI has assumed the duties of the general contractor to complete construction and installation work at the start-up and technical complex by the scheduled launches in the fourth quarter.
According to IA, Mr. Ochatkov's transition to a new job was motivated by disagreements with the management of the CENCI on how to complete the construction of the facilities and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as on how to work with subcontracted organizations.
"It was decided that it would be best for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
A government official, in turn, calls the solution strange: "He was one of the best professionals, it will be difficult to find an equivalent replacement for him."
According to IA, this will not be required: the post of technical director of the launch site will be abolished and its functions will be dispersed to the units of the CENCI.
There will be a two-course programme in music schools
In the future, pupils in children's music schools will be able to pursue two specializations at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture, St. Slav Golubenko, it is possible to re-read repeat subjects to students for this purpose, and the issue of paying for the rest of the second specialty is resolved through special grants, transmitted to RIA News.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this matter under control, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow for two specializations, but will not, at the same time, run counter to existing legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "Non-Child Talk" with the Cirius Children's Centre, student Maria Andreeva reported that she was forced to pay for recurring subjects in a second specialty at the CMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she was in violin and piano class and was awarded competition awards in both directions.
The Head of State recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian was arrested climbing the wall of the skyscraper.
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Cyril N., who climbed the roof of a high-rise building, is detained, reports El Universal portal.
The incident occurred in Mexico City.
The boy, with the help of two unknown men, climbed through a three-metre fence into Nestle's office complex and climbed one of his towers on his own.
In doing so, he did not use any special equipment, insurance or ropes.
The young man's already on the roof.
Members of the Ministry of Public Security let him down by helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
They find out if the young man is lawfully present in the country.
Meanwhile, video of a young man climbing the highlands became popular on the Network.
Users called the young man a Spider-Man.
As the media writes, such experiments are hobbies for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help alleviate the problem.
Red meat and chocolate are commonly regarded as a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests otherwise: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leads to colics and abdominal swelling, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Normally, to mitigate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid of a triptofan protein contributes to the production of immune cells that increase bowel tolerance.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the bowels ensured that harmful germs coming in with food did not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of launching an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too badly disrupted towards inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacteria in their intestines show increasing tolerance of cells.
And this bacteria needs a triptophane -- one of the building blocks of a protein -- to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have established a link between one type of bacteria, the Lactobacillos reuteri, which is part of the normal microbial of the bowel, and the development of a population of cells that foster tolerance.
The more triptophane was contained in the feeding of mice, the more these immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work for people: a combination of L. reuteri and a triptophane-rich diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammable environment in the bowel.
Postdoc Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganovas, studying a variety of tolerant immune cells, found that one group of guinea mice had these cells, and another group that belonged to the same line but was held separately had none.
She suggested that the distinction could be caused by microbial intestinal intestinal intestinals - communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of mouse intestinal cells was sequenced, and six types of bacteria present in mice with immune cells but missing in mice without them were discovered.
Mouses grown in sterile environments that did not have a good microbial and that did not develop this type of immune cell received L. reuteri, and they had immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then carried small portions of liquid - without bacteria - to underdeveloped immune cells separated from mice.
The immune cells have become more tolerant cells.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the processing of triptophane, known as indol-3-milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of triptophane in mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of triptophane was halved, the number of cells also fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragán explains that humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether triptophane by-products from L. reuteri contribute to the development of cells in humans in the same way as mice, but in humans suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, defects in triptophane-related genes have been found.
She says, "We may need to strengthen the development of these cells, because these cells are the key to inflammatory processes on the inside of the intestines.
High levels of triptophane with L. reuteri are potentially likely to increase their population."
According to José Mourinho, Manchester United hired "genius" in Nemania Matic
Manchester United hired "genius" in Nemania Matic, considers Jose Mourinho after midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The player, acquired for £40 million from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last UEFA pre-season match before the UEFA Super Bowl against Real Madrid on Thursday and impressed as a midfielder, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke ahead when they had a good time.
However, as Matić did not participate in Chelsea's preseason tour of Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game, and he endured only 45 minutes, which, according to Maurinho, requires further work before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in the way he thinks – he thinks football," said Maurinho.
"We'll help him get ready sooner than later".
Like Matić, his fellow-new players Victor Lindelof and Romela Lukak began the game at Aviv Stadium when Maurinho began forming his main composition by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Maurinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
"I thank the club for getting three out of four," he added.
"I'll be more excited if they get me four out of four, but they've already done a lot for me."
Former leaders of the Social Democrats of Lithuania urge them to remain in the ruling coalition
Former presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, ex-premiers Algirdas Butkjavicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former Speaker of the Seimas for Social Democrats Cheslovas Jurschenas called on one-partyers to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the Parliamentary Gazette, due to tensions with partners, the Union of Peasants and Greens, a discussion has been initiated in the Social Democratic Party on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here are three senior experienced comrades who addressed an open letter to the one-party, stating, inter alia, "It is understandable that the party's comrades have been disappointed with the election results, but the coalition with the peasants has created not very easy conditions for us to continue to implement the social justice goals that we have initiated in the Government's programme and to maintain the political dominance of the left-wing center over the right-wing parties."
According to former party leaders, for the time being "emotional expression of opinion has prevailed without concrete arguments".
The authors of the letter fear that their party's reckless actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
The disabled Anton Mamayev was fined.
Moshorsud reduced the sentence of the wheelchair disabled Anton Mamayev from four and a half years' imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
The convicted person had previously been released from the SIZO by decision of the Timiryazevsk Court.
However, Moshorsud confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he organized the robbery and abduction of a scooter from a former SWAT fighter.
Moshorsud reduced Anton Mamayev's sentence to 200,000 rubles by his decision.
"Mamayev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms part of the crime, and therefore such a person must be held criminally liable," explained IA spokesperson Moshorsud Ulyan Solopov.
In the present case, the court took account of Mamaev ' s state of health, the factual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, according to which punishment may be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Mamaev's assistant, Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would have led to a change in the category of gravity of the act and a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamayev himself stated that he remained unhappy with Moshorsud's decision.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be to justify it, and will continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not exclude appeals against the judgement before the Court of Cassation of Mosgorsud and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the leverage up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "RIA News."
Remember, 28-year-old Moscow Anton Mamayev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became a figure in the criminal case last fall.
The disabled claims to have bought a motorbike from acquaintances for 160,000 rubles to sell.
However, the scooter owners, among them a former SWAT fighter, claimed that the disabled and his assistant, Vasily Seroshtanov, had taken their property, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasilia Seroshtanov to three years in the colony and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years ' imprisonment with serving his sentence in the general-regime colony (under article 162, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code).
After the disabled person was placed in the SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Office of the Procurator-General for Human Rights under President Tatiana Moskalkov, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamayev was released from SIZO by a decision of the same Timyrazev court.
The defence, in turn, appealed the decision of first instance in Mosgorsud.
UNF will prepare a report on the environment to the President
The final “Action Forum” of the Pan-Russian People's Front (NFF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, informed the News source at the ONF and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the Alexei Anisimov movement.
He said that, following the forum, the “frontists” were planning to prepare a report to the President on domestic environmental problems and to propose a strategy to address them.
News interviewers at the ONF note that the Head of State's report will contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to News, the final UNF forum will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of the event has not yet been determined - it is usually tailored to the President, who is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at key UNF events.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts each in Rostov-on-Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirova.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital city of the Republic of Buryatia Ulaanbaatar.
Based on the proposals that have been and will be made at these events, we will form systemic proposals to address environmental problems, and we have told the UNF News.
The Co-Chairman of the Central Staff of the Olga Timofeev Movement, who chaired the State Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, reported that the “frontists” would report to the Head of State on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the UNF “Forum for Action” are likely to be combined.
In a year, we left behind a powerful team of environmental experts, saw gaps in legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be included in the report that we are preparing for the President as leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the “frontists” are also reporting on the work on the priority projects of the ONF,” Olg Timothy's News.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergei Ivanov, would be invited to the forum.
He had previously participated in the UNF Media Forum, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the year of ecology will be a thing of history, and the most important thing that needs to be done today is to launch environmental mechanisms to make them work for years to come.
To keep these matters on the agenda, Olga Timothy added.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), Andrey Kolyadin, noted that in raising environmental issues, the SWF was following the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts offered in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the President,' said Andrei Kolyadin's News.
He stressed that, to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be ruled out, which could provide additional impetus to the regions for development.
In the future, the regions would be able to lobby not only for their environmental problems, but also for the development of eco-tourism, with the help of the SWF, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues demonstrated a “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about a landfill in Balashyeh (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (a bill to ban open trans-shipment of coal in localities, one of the authors, Olga Timothyev, has already been drafted).
Environmental experts believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in the Russian Federation as a whole has been established, and the issue is further enforcement practice, as well as the position of civil society.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is needed, according to Leonid Bochin, the head of the charitable foundation “Ecology for All”.
HRC member, the head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace Russia, Sergei Tsyplenkov, in a conversation with News, stressed that a responsible approach by society and business was needed to successfully solve environmental problems, with little legislative effort.
As soon as society and business realizes that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, as pointed out by Sergei Chickenkov.
The expert stressed that there was a need to reverse the trend that violation of environmental law was an economic solution for business.
The British inventor implanted a microchip to get into the house and the car by a wave of his hand.
The British inventor was the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office and even start the car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northham has implanted a tiny chip between big and index fingers and now offers this service through his firm BioTeck to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives at the expense of technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anaesthetist consultant from the Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the injection procedure was conducted in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is like a microchip that injects cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northham's company also replaces locks in houses and cars on a chip-compatible price of £300 per lock.
One child's married father has already installed technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House prop cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to the records of the armed forces provided by the magazine "TIME", the White House's decision last month to bring a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers an entire $24,000.
White-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as "Marine One", when the president is on board, became a central element of an event held on July 17 at the White House that featured American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials examined technology products from all 50 states.
The helicopter produced in Connecticut was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire vehicle from Wisconsin, and a cargo truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Squadron of Marine Helicopters (HMX-1), the helicopter control division, the White House Military Department ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO", just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of the "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to make sure you knew because this is an unusual, widely publicized event," wrote HMX-1 in an e-mail to his superior, the first deputy chief of Marine Corps aviation, the day before the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at around 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in an event scheduled for 3 a.m. and would remain there until the lawn was released between 6 and 9 p.m. the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to fly back in accordance with the working hours restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security officers remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records received by TIME magazine, it is unclear whether a second crew was eventually required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event contradicted this regulation.
"We asked, among other things, whether it was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told that it wasn't," the commander wrote.
"You seem to have nowhere to go," the deputy chief replied.
The event "Delivered in America" was announced by the White House as an official event, and it was not covered by Hatch's law.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the health-care reform then in the Senate and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as "Marine One" and "Air Force One" for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's unusual to request them for the sake of photo ops.
Trump was already the subject of discussions in February when the presidential plane drove in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with reports of complaints about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor.
"White house thrilled with the show "Make in America" featuring products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said White House's deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around the Washington Agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the United States President's transportation to the White House to the nearest inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings outside the White House.
According to one official, the flight, performed for the event "Make in America", was counted to the crew for the necessary training flights in a month.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of "non-presidential support tasks".
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not been involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not record the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense's reimbursement rate for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's records show that the aircraft in the air was 30 minutes each way from its airfield at the Quantico Marine Air Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
"It is totally wrong to calculate the value for taxpayers based on the approximate rate of reimbursement," Walters says.
"These approximate rates include personnel, service and many other irreversible costs that are included in annual allotments".
According to a 2015 study conducted by RAND Corporation, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do indeed take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House spokesperson Sean Spicer spoke out in defense of the helicopter's use for the event.
"The idea is to demonstrate this week things done in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose job depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
So, of course, it is perfectly appropriate to pay attention to this."
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter by inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he definitely sat in the driver's seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, joking to the press about his own product fleet of the company.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three."
Moscow will provide grants for urban hospital resuscitation units
Every year, Life Saving grants will be provided to the intensive care units of the Metropolitan Medical Clinic.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited Yudin City Clinic Hospital.
During his examination of the clinic, he gave a letter of gratitude to the trauma doctor ortoped by Victor Protsko, under whose supervision he conducted the most difficult operation to reconstruct the foot of the teenager.
Sergei Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to grant grants annually to the intensive care units of the city's clinics.
Funds will be allocated to the promotion of doctors and nurses.
According to the Metropolitan City Chief, Yudin Clinic Hospital is currently one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new and sophisticated equipment to enable its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the Colombo Rural Hospital.
At present, the wards of the medical institution are intended to cater for over 1,000 patients.
In addition to resuscitation and inpatient services, there are day-care units.
The hospital has 2,800 staff.
The total area occupied by medical practitioners is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the health facility became part of a pilot project on short-term inpatient care (SCP).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
Advanced medical equipment is used in surgical interventions to significantly reduce the time taken to rehabilitate patients.
After the hospital surgery, they only spend a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients were provided with hospital care at Yudin Clinic.
The clinic's medical staff performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported no buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
In the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), there were no applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
This is reported by TASS on Friday, 4 August, with reference to a spokesperson for the NBU.
The NBA confirms that on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from Victor Procopeni, a Belarusian and Cypriot citizen, to agree on an intermediary (through Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 per cent of Sberbank shares has been withdrawn.
"No documents were received from other potential investors to purchase Sberbank shares in the NBA," the report states.
On 3 August, Belarusian businessman Victor Procopenja withdrew his bid to purchase Sberbank's subsidiary structure.
On 28 July, it was reported that the National Bank of Ukraine had refused Russian businessmen Said Guceriev and Gregory Guselnikov to acquire the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator based his decision on the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification of their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian law.
Sberbank reported selling its Ukrainian "daughter" to Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March of this year.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guceriev.
Sanctions against the “daughters” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from taking capital out of the country in favour of parent organizations.
The third season trailer "Narcko": in the popular Netflix series after Pablo Escobar's death, the Cali cartel plays a central role
Although the identity of Pablo Escobar's killer was revealed in the second season of Narco, the Netflix series is far from complete.
The stream service has already confirmed that seasons three and four are planned, and the third has already been introduced by the first trailer to demonstrate the villains of the upcoming show.
In the third season, the most wealthy drug trafficking organization, the Cali cartel, attracted the attention of the Drug Enforcement Agency.
An organization led by powerful godfathers works as a corporation on the Fortune 500 list, with only a large number of government bribes and acts of violence.
Cartel Leader – Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela (Damian Alcastar), Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela (Franci Denis) – her brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is responsible for relations with Mexico, and Chape Santacrus-London (Pepe Rapasote) works in New York City.
In a recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character who attracts American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to help in the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Igel Angel Sylvester, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narco will be released on September 1.
Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, stated at the UN.
The elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, are represented, and the head of the UN mission to Afghanistan announced on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Heisom, current head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for the vice-presidential position, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Choices can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial council elections and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban threatens to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year's election, power is, for the first time, passed peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Hayes stated that enhancing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghanistan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The Office of the Prosecutor General confirmed the indictment against Nikita Belykh
The Office of the Prosecutor-General of the Russian Federation confirmed the indictment in the criminal case against the former governor of Kirovsk province, Nikita Belykh, accused of having received a large bribe.
This was reported to the agency on Thursday, 3 August, transmitting RIA News.
The file was transferred to the Presnesky District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
In Venice, fines were increased for tourists for inappropriate behaviour.
The Venice authorities have tightened the bathing fines in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
Walking around the city in a bathing suit or with a naked torso will now be fined 200 euros.
For 100 euros, it will require a picnic in a public place or a bicycle ride through pedestrian areas to transmit the TASS with a reference to the Russian Tour Operators Association.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide a fine for inscriptions on 400 Euro monuments and 25 Euros for garbage.
To inform tourists about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice will be through a special company called Enjoy, Respect Venice (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) on social media, as well as through advertisements and posters on the city council website, billboards and places where tourists are most concentrated.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the tourism adviser of Venice, Paula Mar, fines will be passed on to the embassies of the home countries of the violators in order to warn their compatriots against such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she noted.
In April, the Italian city administration reported plans to limit the flow.
Venice has already successfully limited the number of tourists visiting the city centre.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to observe the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were admitted to the scene.
In addition, there has been a moratorium on the establishment of new hotels and fast-food restaurants in the historical part of Venice.
In the first half of 2017, State Border Service officials detained 272 illegal migrants at the border with EU countries; a total of 1,059 irregular migrants were detained.
This was reported to the State Border Service.
Of these, 314 were detained for illegal border crossing, while the rest were detained for violating the rules governing the residence of foreigners in Ukraine and other offences.
The largest number, 717 illegal migrants, was detained at the border with Moldova.

According to statistics, most of the detained illegal migrants are nationals of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, India and Armenia.
In addition, almost 2,000 potential illegal migrants were not allowed into Ukraine.
Let us recall that the EU has found an unusual way to get rid of migrants.

SF relieved Ozerov of the post of head of the committee
On Wednesday, the Federation Council endorsed the statement of Victor Ozerov, Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, and relieved him of his position.
He remains a senator from Khabarovsk Kray.
A statement asking to be relieved of his position as Lakes wrote last week.
He explained his decision to the need for rotation and his desire to "change the pace of life".
The Senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.
Victor Lakesov has represented the legislative assembly of Khabarovsky Krai in the Russian Federation since 1996.
The Committee on Defence and Security has been chaired by the Senator since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Buryatia
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Since 1 September, the cost of low voltage electricity for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25 per cent.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian Federation, in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation on amendments to the Regulations on the Wholesale Market for Electricity and Power and on the Consolidated Projected Balance of Production and Supply of Electrical Energy (power) within the Russian Single Energy System for the Entities of the Russian Federation (No. 842), established indicative electricity and power prices for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryat.
As a result, the cost of electricity for buryats is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the Republic have been ploughing the threshold of Moscow's cabinets in futile attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighbouring Irkut region with the hydropower cascade on Angara, flowing from Baikal, for which Buryatia is the main catchment area.
It was not until this year that changes began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 roubles/kWh to 3.93 roubles/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of Buryatiya by decision of the Federal Government in the List of Wholesale Price Zones for which the characteristics of wholesale and retail markets are established, industrial consumers have taken a turn.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays for kilowatt/h 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date for new tariff movements downwards for Buryatia.
Scooter was not afraid of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine and flew to Crimea.
The legend of electronic dance music, a group of Scooter flew to Crimea without fear of threats from the Office of the Procurator-General of Ukraine.
"The flight went well, and tomorrow I'm going to have a concert," says RIA "News" the frontman of H.P. Baxter.
Earlier, a German edition of Bild, referring to the Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Evgeny Yenin, reported that the arrival in Crimea, which in Kiev is considered to be temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, could expose musicians to up to eight years' imprisonment.
Scooter's performance at the Balaclav Festival, which is called #ZBFest, is scheduled for August 4.
#ZBFest is hosted by Golden Balka to celebrate International Champagne Day.
Scooter, one of Germany's most famous groups, was founded in 1993.
Ace's last album was released in 2016.
In addition to Scooter, the festival's guests will be Sergei Galanin and his group Ser Ga, as well as Garik Sukachev with the Brigade S.
The Moscow subway will premiere the new Game of Thrones season.
The Russian premiere of the seventh season of Games of Thrones will take place in the Metropolitan Metro.
That's what the Komsomol Truth website says.
The first episode is known to be shown on the night of July 18 at one of the stations as part of the "Night in the Metro" campaign.
In the lobby, the audience's soundtrack will be met by actors dressed as white walkers.
All who wish to take a photo will also be able to take a copy of the iron throne that will be installed on the platform.
According to Roman Latypov, the first deputy chief of the Moscow Metro, the show underground, which will be the first in history, will help viewers to feel better about what's happening on the screen.
The national union of unskilled, municipal and boiler workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment at the McVitie's factory in Glasgow.
The trade union demands assurances from the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie's in connection with its long-term obligation to produce at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish branch of the GMB reports that the company has ignored the question of future investments at the Transros facility.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies among other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that over £5 million has been invested in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that in the event of any change in the work of the facility, employees and union representatives "are the first to know about them."
In a letter to the head of the company's facility, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded McVitie's response to concerns that funding would not be used to upgrade production lines.
The senior organizer, Drew Duffy, said, "Our union members are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the general manager of the facility on business needs and investment plan regarding the future of Tolcross."
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in the territory of the Greater Glasgow; it is an essential pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, rising subsistence minimum and chronic decline in production, the East End Glasgow desperately needs to thrive in the McVitie's factory.
According to a representative of Pladis, "The leader of the Interrosian facility just yesterday received a letter from the Scottish GMB office, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with union staff and representatives."
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolkross with staff and GMB representatives to discuss a number of issues openly.
We have talked to staff about how all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic environment are constantly reviewing their actions – and this applies to all of our facilities and activities – in order to remain competitive.
"In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our interpretation facility, especially in production lines and improved performance".
We are fully aware of the value of Tolkross as a production facility, and in the event of any change in the work at this facility, the employees and union representatives will be the first to learn about it."
Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin stated that the Kremlin and Cabinet should be involved in the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petroleum Company (VNHC), but no one would give Gazprom instructions, nor Rosnefti.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the contradictions that had arisen.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that the relationship between Rosneftew and Gazprom should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on gas for the VNHC was putting the project at risk.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue was ongoing.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the Rosnefti perimeter, but we don't have such resources," added Sechin.
It should be recalled that Rosneft requested permission to use gas from the Gazproma field on the Sahalin shelf for the “Eastern Petroleum Company”.
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on the issue were continuing and “there are no sharp corners”.

Paris Saint-Germain won't stop chasing Neumar after the club offered £189 million for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record-breaking raid three years ago?
The Sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when League 1 club was ready to break the world record on transition costs, more than double the previous mark related to Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transition is completed, Neumar will become the world's most expensive player, as well as the world's highest-paid professional athlete, as the SGC offers him a salary of over £500,000 a week clean.
Barcelona is known to be a fury from how the offer was made, and how Neumar ended the contract, despite the insistence of a source close to the leadership of the Catalan club, the club has always done its best for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by the president of the SGC?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club that would like to lure one of the best players in the SGC.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll confront them, we'll make offers to their players," Al-Khelafi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences."
It appears that Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club expressed interest in midfielder Marco Verratti from the SGC earlier this summer.
The SGC has made it clear that it will not release the Italian player on any terms, and now likely Barcelona feels the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neumar.
Putin has commissioned payments to the forest fire victims.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has commissioned an understanding of the material assistance provided to forest-affected residents and the construction of new housing.
I'd like to hear how the work is going today.
In particular, please report on the status of the payments made to the injured citizens.
I have some misunderstandings.
“On this point, I would also like to ask relevant colleagues how much money has been allocated,” Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the Baikal regions.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baykal State Nature Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the Plenipotentiaries of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Noilo, and the head of the Baykal branch of FGBU "Glavrybvod" Leonid Mihailik.
They told me about the work on cleaning up the lake.
The boys were then shown in an open tank next to the container that had been prepared for raising.
At first, Putin let some of the boys out of the net.
Then he pulled a special lever on the container lid and released the others.
Also during the trip, the leader commissioned an environmental situation on Baikal and built a road on Olhon Island.
According to MINStroj, one volume is needed, but there is an alleged other volume.
"I want to figure out what's actually going on there with our funding," said the Russian leader.
It should be recalled that during the 2017 forest fires, the villages of Buryatia, Irkut province, were hit by fire, and homes and buildings were destroyed.
In Ukraine, Russians were asked to be sent to prison for illegal border crossing
The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has registered a draft law under which Russians may be subject to criminal sanctions for illegally crossing the Ukrainian border.
According to RT, a document registered in the electronic database of the Ukrainian Parliament implies a three-year prison sentence for Russian citizens attempting to enter the country illegally.
It is noted that for a repeat offence or an act committed by a group of persons, the sentence may be increased to five years.
If, however, the perpetrator was detained at the border with the weapon, the time of detention for him would increase to eight years.
It was previously reported that Ukrainian border guards had detained Ukrainians attempting to enter Russia outside the designated crossing points.

There will be two new territories in Russia that are leading socio-economic development, Abaza and Novotroitsk.
The relevant decisions of the Government of the Russian Federation will enter into force today, 4 August.
The boundaries and types of economic activity of the ToR in the territory of the city of Abaza in the Republic of Hakasia have been defined.
The city of 15,000 people will have a special legal regime for business activities, as well as a minimum capital investment by residents and a minimum number of new permanent jobs.
This is expected to attract about 2.5 billion rubles of investment to the city, as well as to generate more than 600 new jobs.
The list of economic activities in which Abaza will have a special legal regime for business activities, for example, includes crop production, animal husbandry, food production, non-alcoholic beverages and clothing.
Already, the Government has signed framework agreements for the implementation of eight investment projects.
It is also planned to reduce the Territory's dependence on the Abaka Mine Towning Company.
In January 2017, the region's authorities reported that Hakasia had met all the conditions of Mineconom Development to create a TOR.
The authorities of the Orenburg region also did the same.
There, in the city of Novotroitsk, a territory that is leading socio-economic development will also be established.
This will lead to the diversification of the monocity economy, reduce its dependence on the urbanizing enterprise AO Ural steel, and create more than 23,000 jobs and attract investment of more than 8 billion rubles.
The list of economic activities in which the new TOR will have a special legal regime for entrepreneurs includes, inter alia, freshwater fisheries, feed, medicines and medical supplies.
Novotrotitzk was the first of the monocitys of the Orenburg region to acquire the status of TOR.
It should be recalled that the area of advanced development is an economic zone with preferential tax conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges created to attract investment in improving the lives of the population.
Among the benefits for the residents of the TOR are: a profit tax of not more than 5 per cent in the first five years, and at least 10 per cent in the next five years, social contributions of 7.6 per cent in 10 years, the use of a free customs area, preferential access to various infrastructure facilities, and preferential rent rates.
Loza called Manson a "screw" and threatened to "punch in the face"
Yuri Loza expressed his outrage at the statement made by American rock musician Marilyn Manson, who insulted Moscow.
In an interview with Komsomol Truth, a Russian singer called Manson a "wolve" and a "screw."
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow such statements do not need to be invited to Russia.
Besides, Loza thinks Manson needs to be "faced" for his words.
Let us recall that an American artist, known for his epathetic acts, spoke harshly of the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Earlier on Thursday, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that Manson's statement was commented by domestic producer Joseph Prigojin.
