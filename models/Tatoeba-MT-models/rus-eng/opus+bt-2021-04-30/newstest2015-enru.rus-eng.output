Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
The new Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, meets with his Japanese colleague, Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo to discuss economic and security ties, as part of his first serious overseas visit after winning the elections in May.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world's third largest economy.
At the forefront of the agenda are plans to enhance nuclear cooperation.
India also reportedly looks forward to an agreement on defence cooperation between the two States.
FANO Russia will hold a final expert session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FANO) will co-organize with the RA a third expert session on the “Evaluation of the effectiveness of scientific organizations”.
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, and is reported in a press release to the Lenta.Ru editorial.
At the third meeting, it is planned to take stock of the work of the Expert Session over the year and to establish a final list of indicators to assess the performance of scientific organizations.
Individual participants in the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for assessing the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting assessments.
The third expert session will be a concluding event in a series of developments to develop a common approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the final version of the normative instruments is in the process of being agreed upon.
As a result of the next session, we must finalize the processes of scientific and expert analysis and agree on the stages and timing of the assessment," said the head of the expert and analytical department of the Federation of Russia, Elena Aksenov.
Representatives of more than a hundred Russian scientific institutions will participate in the event.
It is expected to result in the adoption of a resolution.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on 16 September 2014 at 14th Street, Moscow, Moscow.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruz studied turbulence and its impact on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of experts will allow for the search of related stars, i.e. those originating from the same cluster.
The results of their research were published in Nature magazine and are briefly available on the university's website.
The cause of the same chemical composition of nearby stars is the turbulence in the clouds of gas prior to the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the stellar cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of the descendant stars.
Scientists have previously had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster may result in differences in its chemical content from those of relatives in the cluster.
Modelling results from astrophysics show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, experts using a supercomputer modeled two streams of interstellar gas that together formed a cloud.
This object has been transformed for several million years by its own gravity into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
Scientists added markings to the initial gas streams and found that rapid turbulence in the cloud resulted in a high degree of chemical uniformity.
Astrophysics is believed by its researchers to prove that it is possible to search for chemically related stars as well as to identify possible regions of the formation of such objects.
Carrata police arrested a 20-year-old after chasing a high-speed motorcycle.
The motorcycle was confiscated after being driven at 125 km/h in an area with a speed limit of 70 km/h and via a busheland to escape the police in Pilbar.
A transport police patrol in Karrat attempted to stop the blue motorcycle this morning, finding that its speed reached 125 km/h as he left the service station at Butgate Road.
The police report that the motorcyclist did not stop and continued to travel on Burgess Road, then turned into a bushland, causing the police to lose sight of him.
A motorcycle and a person matching the driver's description were seen near a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarre.
Carrata police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and dangerous driving.
He is scheduled to stand trial before the Karrata Peace Court on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.
School year in the DNR will not start before October
The DNR will not start its school year on 1 September, as only 10 per cent of children in the region.
This was reported by the Minister of Education and Science of the self-proclaimed Republic, Igor Kostenok.
He said that 11 per cent of schoolchildren had gone to other regions of Ukraine and 20 per cent to Russia.

However, teachers will come to work on September 1.
Investigation into the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo completed in 2012
The Russian Investigation Committee completed an investigation into the criminal case of the TJ-204 plane crash at Vnukovo Airport in December 2012.
This was reported to the SC of the Russian Federation today.
“The Moscow Interregional Investigation Department for Transportation of the Russian Investigation Committee has completed its investigation into the criminal case brought by the accident of the TJ-204 aircraft of Red Wings at Vnukovo Airport on 29 December 2012, on the grounds of the crime provided for in article 263, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code, / the violation of the rules for the safety of traffic and the operation of air transport, resulting in the death of two or more persons due to negligence”, said the agency's report.
The disaster was caused by the crew ' s failure to comply with standard procedures and the increased speed of boarding.
George Webster is charged with rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlohri
The man will stand trial for rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was charged at a High Court hearing in Glasgow.
Allegedly, he raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlohri, Pertshire, on June 7, 2013.
Webster allegedly attacked her when she was "unconscious, asleep and unable to give consent."
In addition, Webster is accused of raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, which is in the North Scotland Highlands, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Ray has scheduled a High Court hearing in Edinburgh on November 17.
Lavrov: Russia will not "clame the door" due to new sanctions and will not withdraw from the WTO
Russia will not clap the door in connection with the new sanctions.
This was announced today by the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov, speaking to MIMO students and teachers.
Regarding our response to a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything must be precisely calculated, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will be like this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not involve slamming doors, some offenses that are misunderstood, the minister stressed.
We will, above all, build on our interests, our interests to protect our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners with regard to their adequacy, contractuality and reliability.
The steps being taken in the area of sanctions can be very well judged by what partners are seeking - the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation continued.
If it's said all over that "they'll be painful to us, too, but we have to do it to punish Russia," that's probably not very adequate."
As far as WTO is concerned, the Russian Federation ' s response to possible new sanctions is not.
On the contrary, we want to learn more about the WTO tools, including when it comes to trade disputes, Lavrov said.
We have already used this tool to overcome what we believe is the EU's discriminatory anti-dumping policy.
According to the Minister, Russia has been accused of dumping while applying anti-dumping measures against sectors of the Russian Federation's economy.
“We are ready to engage the WTO mechanisms and to defend our position against the application of the EU’s third energy package rules retrospectively,” said Lavrov.
How is it right to use siren in garden design?
The questions are answered by Irina Okunev:
Since the lilac loses its main appeal after flowering, it is desirable to plant it with other shrubs.
It combines beautifully with many cultures.
And next to the siren, plants that are decorative at other times and that bloom at the same time can and should be planted.
Another benefit of the siren is that it provides a lot of creative opportunities.
You can form it with a strain tree of various heights, an improved bush, a bush with a broad base, and even like a garden bonsai tree with a bizarrely curved stem.
Just pick the shape that's more appropriate to your garden design.
In Karelia, a resident of Leningrad Oblast was convicted of selling counterfeit money
According to reports in the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal activities in the Olonetsk and Szegezh districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in the Vologda region, where he was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment in the spring of this year.
The man later appeared before the Olonetsky District Court.
And in order to complete the investigation of the crimes committed in our Republic, he was staged in Ségeju.
The investigation proved guilty on several episodes of counterfeit money sales dating back to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the criminal case file containing the indictment was sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to commute the term of deprivation of liberty to four years, with the general regime serving in the colony.
The sentence did not enter into force.
Let us recall that last week, two other counterfeit money dealers were convicted and paid for at Petrozavodsk's stores.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is imprisoned for five years and the other for four years.
Each is fined 500,000 rubles.
The sentence has also not yet entered into force.
Archangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first Dervish convoy.
The match, which took place at the regional centre, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish delivered military aid to the USSR from the United States and the United Kingdom.
In Archangelsk, a memorial rally was held near a mortgage stone to a monument to members of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov waterfront name in Solombala.
The event brought together representatives of the Veteran organizations of Archangelsk, children from the Cadet class.
We first met twenty-three years ago when a mortgage stone was laid.
But at the same time, today’s event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who have not been brought back by the sea.” Boris Karpov, chairman of the North Sea Shipping Council, noted.
The event then featured the city's perfume orchestra, and the Cadet class's pupils gave the veterans flowers and marched with Russian flags and the Victory banner.
The match ended with the allocation of flowers to the mortgage stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of formal boots, tin, wool and many other items and equipment).
In addition, there were 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines and 15 Harrickain fighter aircraft on board, in disassembled condition.
At the same time, the escort convoy consisted of 16 British Navy ships, of which two were aircraft carriers.
The ship's caravan was not detected by the enemy and reached its destination safely, Archangelska.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 transport vessels and some 50 military vessels were killed.

Remembering the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill under which the organization of trade unions is protected as civil law.
"Where unions are, there are middle-class jobs," says Allison, a Minnesota Democrat who is co-chair of Congress Progressive Fraction.
That's why I'm proud to present the Workers Empowerment Act along with the symbol of the civil rights movement John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunity to discriminate against trade union organizations as other forms of discrimination by stopping the forces of trade union opponents.
The amendment of the Labour Relations Regulation Act to allow workers who face discrimination for participating in trade union organizations to seek justice in the civil courts - and to receive damages and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis, and the co-authors of the bill are to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country - Americans once supported countries around the world in accepting, expanding and respecting labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remembered when that country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas McArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution drafted to guarantee that Hideki Tojo's paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize, to negotiate and to collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhauser and his assistants helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that stated openly: “The right to form associations to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will have no legal effect; measures to that end will be declared illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights to be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a world agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect his interests”.
For generations, Americans have taken for granted the basic position that labour rights are human rights.
When that country consulted other countries on how to build civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and to have that trade union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise indeed to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the nation's power, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how it owes us.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis revive the ideals that historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, a federal judge temporarily blocked the enactment of Louisiana law on Sunday, about which his supporters say he will likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under this measure, which was signed for execution by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jinadl in June and was due to enter into force on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have authority to receive patients in the hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision meant that doctors could now continue to perform legal abortions while continuing to seek such authority.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to take action to obtain authority," wrote Judge John de Gravels in his decision.
A hearing will be scheduled within a month during which the judge will render a more permanent decision on the law.
Advocates of the right to abortion welcomed this decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital authority.
"Today's decision guarantees that Louisiana women will be protected from a treacherous law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northapp, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the five state clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from the two clinics who had not filed claims in the case and also applied for admission.
Louisiana is in 11 states that have passed such laws, and the courts have recently ruled such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Lawyers for the right to abortion, together with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, say that laws on admission powers impose restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women ' s health, although some also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who aborts in Louisiana has the authority to receive at the hospital, reported to the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop doing this, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop doing so, the team reported.
Criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for admission were awaiting a decision.
This will lead to the introduction of quotas on domestic products
At least half of the products for each commodity in the range of trade networks should be Russian-made, according to State Duma MP Oleg Nilov of the Fair Russia faction.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers and writes The News.
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This is the case for goods that are not produced in Russia, and for the rest of the products that are produced in Russia, the rhythmler will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers," the Niles reported to the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article “On the basis of State regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation”, the draft law provides for the amendment of the Tax Code, which sets a lower VAT rate of 10 per cent for the sale of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50 per cent quota in trade networks is part of the stimulus package for Russian producers.
There will be several times as many domestic goods on the counters.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to Taxiwick's lawyer, Sergei Litvinenko, a member of the independent expert centre “Public Duma”, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
The plus will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They'll be able to sell more, which means the profits will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices to the rhythmlers, as they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, resulting in higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some faster to develop, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will be reduced several times, but not immediately," the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises were often unable to break into local store counters due to high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now that the embargo has been imposed, this niche has been liberated and can breathe with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that, after all the necessary agreements and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, now is the "silence moment" when the former players have already left and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, we can talk about increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products," told AiF.ru, the first Vice-President of the Russian-wide public organization “Russian Club of Financial Directors”, by Tamara Kasianova.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food commodities in each category would allow the sector to be reserved for local producers.
In such a case, they would compete with each other rather than with goods that were subsidized by another State at a lower cost.
In other words, the competition for the buyer will unfold between companies operating under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes that Russian producers are not able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of compatriots on all counts.
In this situation, the trading networks will have to “reach” the share of Russian goods to half the range.
As a result, there is a growing fear that poor goods will be placed on the counters.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be supplied under the guise of production in Russia," the expert adds.
The negative effects of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that benefit better from cooperating with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will suffer as demand for their products decreases.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods may affect consumers as well.
The point is that some Russian-made products may be inferior to imported analogues, while shops can raise prices for second products like scarce goods.
The idea of import substitution, forgotten in the early 2000s, was again discussed by economists in February this year due to the continuous devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of abandoning imported products is even more pressing.
The purpose of the Act is to require retailers to treat suppliers as domestic producers in order to make orders.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the route of import substitution, and the production planning system for the required products will be established in a shorter time frame," says MP Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism would be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where capacity was particularly high, for example in the dairy industry, where imports accounted for 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really capable of covering Russian store counters completely.
In addition, meat production can also gain strong momentum.
As is well known, the highest proportion of imported beef remains between 30 and 35 per cent.
So 65-70 percent is still Russian produce," Kasyanova argues.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of quotas on domestic products will facilitate import substitution and can accelerate this process.
However, this initiative alone will not lead to import substitution, as it requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is certain.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under the initiative could still be imported from abroad, which meant that there would be no full import substitution, but significant steps in that direction would be taken.
Moreover, there was little quota, and domestic production was still needed to meet those quotas.
These quotas will provide such guarantees," the expert notes.
Untimely diagnosed and lack of access to optimal treatment means that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who forgive in rural Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers analysed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent had lived five years after being diagnosed.
Senior researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute of Medical Research reported that the probability of dying during the study is 20 percent higher for those living in regions and remote areas of the state than for those living in urban areas.
A LOT RESEARCH: New drugs can slow down lung cancer and ovarian cancer
Researchers followed the medical path of women in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the woman's age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those living in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside cities were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that delayed diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecology cancer, and they are mostly in big cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of tele-health services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of exit services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home, and programmes to support people undergoing treatment far away from their home, could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study revealed that the long life expectancy of women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elisha Nive, was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open doors in the Kuzhener district.
The construction of a health facility in the village of Toktaibeljak was initiated in April of this year and followed a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Office of Public Relations and Information of Head Mary El, the construction of the facility was financed from the funds of the Republic budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the treatment and prevention facility built is almost 230 square metres.
The villages of Toktaibeljak and the villages of Dementjevo, Püncheryumal, Tuña, Fomichi, Toraibeljak, Shinur and Chashkayal will be treated here.
The new midwifery clinic will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resource and its premises are not in accordance with sanitary requirements.
A new institution will be launched shortly.
She who killed her four-month-old son in a drunken state will be brought to justice.
A resident of Chuvashia will be on trial for the murder of her own child.
The investigation into the criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboxarska, charged with causing death by negligence, has been completed in Cheboksaras.
The investigation found that, on 26 July of this year, the accused, together with his four-month-old son, had come to the celebration of the birthday of his cum's child in Cheboksara.
After a long meal, the rookie boxer decided to stay as guests and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, a drunk woman put him on her bed to feed her breast, but soon fell asleep.
During her sleep, the woman fell on her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, reported to the Press Service of the SCR for Chuvashia, was referred to the court.
Inflation is out of vacation.
Do Russians feel price surges
As a result of the Russian Federation-West cross-cutting sanctions, inflation in Russia will accelerate and fail to meet the expectations of the authorities, and the analysts of the TSB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions would lead to an inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writing by BBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, inflation in 2014 will be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent, and the next year it will be 6.5 per cent less.
However, according to the Kommersant newspaper, this week the MER is to make "small but principled" adjustments to the macroeconomic outlook until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency could lower the inflation rate for 2015 to eliminate the expected income increase.
The projection assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation were in effect for the year until August 2015.
In such a situation, how could such high inflation be assumed?
The current situation implies a one-off shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," said a newspaper source in Minfin.
The capital FTB economists do not share the Government's financial and economic bloc's expectations of inflation and forecast an 8 per cent increase in prices in 2014.
The main effect of product bans will come with the possible introduction of a sales tax (SNA) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflationary peak of 9% will be in February, after which the annual price increase will go down, experts think.
By the way, last week Rosstat gave the first inflationary score after the Russian Federation introduced "accurate sanctions."
AiF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the Analysis Department, FC AForex:
Price increases have already been observed in the main product segments.
Moreover, when socially important products began to be valued, the Government was forced to initiate systematic price stability monitoring measures to prevent risks of unwarranted price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retakers already report daily to regulators so that authorities know exactly who, when and why the price rises.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be huge capital outflows, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega regulator, internal conversion due to population flight into foreign currency, and the embargo on food imports from countries that have joined sanctions against Russia.
If the inflationary pressure had remained under control, the cost of a basket of minimum products would not have jumped by 12 per cent in just one quarter.
The ban on the importation of food products has triggered supply shocks in the domestic market and has led to a perfectly logical increase in the final cost.
Since at the present stage we have not been able to fully implement the import substitution mechanism, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, counter-insurgency sanctions will continue to carry the risks of inflation.
Adding the fiscal reasons for the lack of confidence in the national currency as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Razuwaev, Director, Alpari Analysis Department
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20 to 30 per cent per month, in zero it was also above current levels, another thing that was offset by rapid economic growth.
I think the year's inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Plato Maguta, asset manager, Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia has so far been successfully contained, but if pressure on the financial sector continues to increase, first and foremost, it can lead to some difficulties and increase the inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually manifested in the purchase of cash currency in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the Government, the CB of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But price increases traditionally begin after the summer calm and may become more pronounced this fall.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5 per cent is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardening centres are saddened by the decline in the number of homeowners
This decline, due to an exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, may result in horticultural centres losing tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach the "basic age of horticulture", according to a study by HTA reported by Financial Times.
According to the report, renters spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on horticulture.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting courtyards in front of the house for parking and the reduction of garden size as other threats to the industry, whose annual sales are estimated at £5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the UK has the lowest expenditure on horticultural goods per household.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society reported that renting housing and lack of garden space did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief horticultural adviser at RHS, said, "The cultivation of plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move."
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the golden age of retailing goods for horticulture as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather following adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out mass cleansing at the Landshedelieu Foundation
Three of the four leaders of the Landelelie Foundation were replaced as early as Friday.
In total, three of the four leaders of the Landelelie Foundation were replaced as early as Friday.
Officially, the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture only reported the removal of the Executive Director, Atanas Dobrev.
Lozan Vasiliev took his place.
It turns out that two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were changed quietly on Friday.
Deputy Executive Director Tatiana Angelova, who had been responsible for public assistance and the SAPARD programme until then, has been released, reports BGNES with reference to the newspaper Trud.
I didn't attend the board of directors of the fund because by law we weren't members of the board, but I was told later that I was released.
I can't tell you why my resignation isn't on the foundation's website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to know more on Monday," said Angelov.
She will be replaced by Ivanka Bagdatov, who has so far been the head of Investment Credit at the central fund at Landshedelia in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
Zivko Zivkov, who was the head of the Regional Directorate of the Landedelije Foundation in the town of Grand Tyrnovo until January 2014, will be appointed to his place.
Only the Deputy Head of the Atije Aliyev-Weli Foundation retained her post.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the agency are not mentioned.
Turkey summons an American diplomat in connection with a report of espionage
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent reported that the American Chargé d'affaires and Turkish officials discussed the message on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and Internet magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan underestimated the importance of this report, saying that all leading countries were spying on each other.
Earlier reports that the main German intelligence agency had also made Ankara a target of intelligence had provoked a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
The largest Chinese companies merged against Alibaba
Chinese companies, among which China's largest commercial real estate developer, the Dalian Wanda Group, and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (social media, Messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese searcher), are creating a company that will compete in the market online trade with Alibaba.
However, catching up on the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left behind even its American rivals, eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of the Largest
Companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in a joint venture, 70% of it will be owned by Wanda and 15% each of the Internet companies, as stated in the Wanda Group's message.
It is planned to register the firm in Hong Kong.
SP will integrate Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China with about 438 million users), Tencent, and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 Fennel hotels, the Wanda group manages at least 49 commercial real estate facilities across China and 40 shopping centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion Yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and a thematic amusement park in Qindao (a city in eastern China on the banks of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American network of AMC Entertainment Holdings cinemas, making the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its own shopping centres, hotels and entertainment places with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the emerging competition of Alibaba.
According to Don Tse, who will lead the new company, by unifying Wanda, he will be able to increase the number of users of his e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new site should be the world's largest online-to-offline platform, noting Dun Ce.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers on the Internet so that they come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O are coupon sales services such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest pie in online commerce," stated Wanda leader Wang Jianlin (quota on Bloomberg).
"There is currently no real O2O site in China, and in this situation the chances are roughly equal," he says.
China's Internet market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will increase more than threefold by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has risen to 632 million, citing Bloomberg data on official statistics: it is larger than the population of any country in the world except India.
It is projected that this number will rise to 850 million by 2015.
Union of the Richest
Tencent's head Ma Huaten until recently was China's richest man, however, according to Bloomberg's millionaire index, the founder of Alabama Jack Ma has already outperformed him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's condition is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his share in Alabama.
Baidu leader Robin Lee now ranks third among China's richest people, while Wang Jianlin of Wanda is the fourth highest ranking.
"It's very interesting to watch this battle: the three richest people join forces to challenge an even richer one," said Bloomberg, director of the China Electronic Commerce Research Center in Hangzhou Cao Lay.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba immediately after the creation: "Rim can't be built in one day."
That Alibaba is not so – not just competing with new companies, but also with the well-deserved leaders of the world’s Internet trade – is illustrated by the previous year’s report on Alibaba’s financial performance for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as a mean between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net return over the period is almost double that of the competitors - it grew almost threefold in annual terms to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has enormous potential for generating money, largely due to his mobile apps," commented Bloomberg an analyst report from Hong Kong's Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba prospectus on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, well above the March figure (163 million).
However, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions during the previous quarter were carried out by mobile devices.
Alibaba is to name the value of its shares before IPO.
According to an average estimate by 11 analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the company can be valued at $187 billion after selling shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba's debut at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place as early as September 16.
Road-show companies preceding this event start on September 3.
Alibaba's release on IPO is expected to be a record in NYSE history and will allow the company to attract around $20 billion.
So far, the record for the volume of U.S. exchange funds was held by the Visa payment system, which in 2008 made the primary placement of its shares, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in the trading networks should be Russian-made, according to members of the State Duma.
They've drafted a bill on the subject.
These include amendments to article 8 of the Federal Code on the Fundamentals of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification under the bill is that at least 50 per cent of domestically produced products in shops must be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are products that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in the winter, so that they will be given a “fix” to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which sets a lower VAT rate of 10 per cent for all food products originating in Russia, and reports to the newspaper News.
On 27 August, a bill was introduced in the lower house of Parliament to amend the PZ “On retail markets”, which proposes to revive farm markets in Russia where small producers can market their products.
Chief of Police Magaluf charged with corruption
The plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Malorki Public Prosecutor on Friday.
The Chief of Calvia Police at the Resort Island of Malorka was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the scandalous Magalufe Center for Unbridled Drunkness.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained as a result of allegations of corruption brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, the street on which most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to Mallorca Diario's daily online publication, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Malorca Anti-Corruption Prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Guards of the National Guard of Spain on charges of corruption and will be questioned by a judge with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say that protectionism by the authorities seriously affects the state of their business.
"The speech is no longer about making money, it's about surviving," said a businessman to the court.
We cannot jeopardize our livelihoods.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf hit the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British recreationist who took a blowover to 24 men during a bar race.
The island's authorities have since tried to stop drunkenness among the rest of Magaluf, minimizing the number of scandalous drinking runs through bars.
In addition, Playhouse club, where the blowjob incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the carnage bar organizers together were fined at €55,000 ($73,000).
The Magaluf Tourist Resort, mainly popular among young British vacationers, was also the site of numerous alcohol-intoxicated accidents associated with the crazy fun known as "balconing" when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
WESNA prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that affected flights to Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm rain fell on the city by 9 p.m., following 6.6 mm that fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short rains with a gust wind, including a thunderstorm that started shortly before 8 p.m. and spilled almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter gave out an early spring meal last week, the temperature dropped again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8C in the city.
Square conditions are believed to have contributed to the delayed landing of Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft was to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but entered the wind shift area - sudden changes in speed or wind direction at short distances - and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the aircraft eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay in this flight caused a subsequent delay to several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with the probability of one or two rains.
The calculation of construction projects in the Russian Federation will be carried out in a new manner
The Federal Antimonopoly Service is taking special control of issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, and connectivity.
The FAS has set up an expert council to promote competition in the construction sector.
At its meeting, the head of the Directorate of Control of HKH, Construction and Natural Resources of FAS, Vadim Soloviev, stated that “the calculation of the construction estimates today is completely incomprehensible”.
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and may lead to an unjustified construction price, as considered by the FAS.
And they offer the cost of building state-owned facilities at the design stage to determine, on the basis of market prices, design solutions instead of the currently estimated standards and single costs for technological operations.
These proposals are on the road map and are currently under consideration in the Minstro.
"Replacement of traditional estimated construction documentation for design calculations should lead to less corruption in the industry," explained Vadim Soloviev's "BSG".
Because now every bolt and nut is counted in the estimates, and it is not always possible to verify everything, so sometimes in the documentation, unscrupulous construction companies can bury whole tractors.
In Minstro, they agree with the FAS.
“The first work on the conversion to cost calculation on structural elements is already in place: methodologies have been developed to calculate the prices of design solutions, to estimate these indicators,” the Chief of the Department of Urban Planning and Architecture of the Municipality of Elena Zhukov told the BSG.
Road construction has been selected as a pilot area.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As stated by the head of Profi-invest, Anatoli Demianco, the RBB, the construction company's head, has long been out of date, but no other mechanism has yet been offered to the business.
“With regard to the proposed calculation of the design elements, this is difficult to implement in practice, as construction of buildings often uses very different technologies”, he believes.
It's no secret the squire develops much thanks to a government order.
According to Catherine Lezina, chairman of the NP's “Expert Community of Professionals of the State Order”, today the State is the most solvent customer.
Deputy Director of Engineering of Rosatom Industrial Capital Development Center Vladimir Malakhov noted that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to the contract portfolio and companies that have monopoly competences and do not allow competitors to enter the field.
He believes that a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is maximized against someone's management influence.
The expert board proposed that the system of State orders be established in such a way that the same performer is not entitled to more than one contract worth more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts worth more than 1 billion rubles.
The Minstro believes that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of its impact on business as well as the effectiveness of building management.
As Elena Zhukov explained, it would then be necessary to entrust the customer with the functions of a general contractor, which would result in an increase in the customer's staffing and budget costs.
In doing so, the client ' s specialists will need to have knowledge to assess the quality and safety of the work performed by the contracting organizations.
Often, such a breakdown would need to identify who would be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly qualified public procurement participants due to a lack of interest in obtaining a public order for part-time work and a small amount of the contract.
The head of the Institute of Procurement's expert advice centre, Alexander Eustaschenkov, believes that the procedure of the State Order has now become a business game for the care of the contractor.
The example was given: “A participant shall indicate “specific indicators” when completing an application, without specifying the words: “or equivalent”, “should be”, “from”, “more”, “less”, “similar”, “type”, “similar type”, “not below”, “below”, “higher”, “may”, “may have”, “may have”, “may have”, “not earlier”, “not earlier”, “not above”, “not allowed”, “not allowed”, etc.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to impose requirements on the content of an application submitted by contracting entities.
Another issue of 44-FZ, in Eustashenkov's view, was the need to assess the quality of the work through the participant's “paper” offer even at the application stage.
In considering the participant's application, it is realistic to assess only the contractor's qualifications, but not the quality of the work that has not even begun, the expert believes.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when accepted.
The expert board also proposed that the margin income be moved from the upper to the lower tier to allow the intermediate contractors to disappear.
The chairman of the expert board, the State Secretary, the deputy head of the FAS, Andrei Tzarikovski, believes that this is not worth doing, as the master contractor should be responsible for the order.
Or else, as in Arkady Rykin's famous "Atel" reprise, "Is there a claim?".
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in shelters, when rockets and landmines fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the territory was recovering from the fighting.
The start of the school sessions brought joy and excitement to the rocket-affected settlements in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of Pashos kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed fragments from the walls and the children's roller coasters before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're happy to look to the future," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibutza Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our neighborhood really need to get back to a decent life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that all of a sudden she would start going to school again "a little strange."
"There was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our homes at all," she said.
President Reuwen Rivlin visited Kibbutz, which is located near the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements, such as Saad, did not go to the street or left their homes, leaving for safer areas further from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, settlements near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a fragment of a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border, which was heavily torn by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to learn carefully and said, "We will do our utmost to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade on Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of the two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
A new phase of proximity talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; however, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli army conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip were damaged and destroyed as a result of Israeli attacks, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 schools, which were converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, education officials postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon open so that we can complete our education like the children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza's schools.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices showed the highest winter growth in seven years.
The housing price index RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital grew by 1.1 percent in August, reported RP data on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined 4.2 per cent increase in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than double the 12-month increase by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless reported that Sydney and Melbourne run a two-tier market.
Figures of the RP Data show that in Sydney housing prices have increased by 16.1 per cent over the past year, compared with 11.7 per cent in Melbourne.
The next largest markets were Adelaide, Brisbein, and Darwin, where prices increased from five to six percent on average.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which suffered government spending cuts, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of real estate items put on the market over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Considering the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will rise in the next three months," he said.
How do people live in the oldest house of Ufa?
There are 18 apartments in the former home of gold-industrialists and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on October Revolution 57/1 (formerly Grand Kazan).
The house of the 18th century has hardly changed since the construction, except for the dilapidation.
The outsiders come here as a tour, and the tenants suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege, the right to live in the oldest Uphim house, the walls of which are remembered by general Alexander Suvorov.
The date of the building of the house is not accurate, historians indicate two dates, 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out the building is under 300 years old.
Old yard, always open door, squeaky stairs.
The doors in the apartments are located close to each other, the walls are cracked, and the street is visible in the clears from the plaster.
Everything seems to be holding on to an honest word.
And the locals say, "You don't think that's true."
Living in an 18th-century wooden house is very difficult, ” says Tatiana Lukianov, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on state guard, but no money is set aside for its maintenance for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have simply forgotten about.
The last one was 40 years ago.
The walls are still skinny-poor, but the foundation is rotten.
Many residents still go to the bathroom outside and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be content with such conditions?!
The road runs right under the windows, not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana's pulling the curtain.
Now you can see what you've heard before: there's a traffic flow under the windows.
You see, the windows are dreary all the time, we can't open the windows, we're used to the noise.
Man gets used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still a model, thanks to his husband, his hands are golden.
Besides, we have two rooms, the three of us with our son.
Other families have worse conditions, with ceilings a little over 1.5 meters high on the second floor.
To contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from Apartment No. 6 Ludmile Old Age.
A nice, hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live with our husband and daughter with our granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, and there's never been another apartment, and Ludmila's eyes are around the room: antresoli, two couches with the letter "g" on one of them, and one of them has a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and little different from the usual domestic interior: only ceilings are beautiful, "historical."
But from the ceiling, it regularly flows: the water system is useless.
Lyudmila speaks of her apartment in a casual and surprising way at the same time, as an Italian woman whose home stands on Roman ruins.
I mean, it's one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The pipeline was conducted some 40 years ago during the last repairs.
That's when they made us a little cuisine in the twirl and a toilet from the former closet.
We live just where Demidov and his family lived, and there were servants on the second floor.
Our apartment isn't privatized, and why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Center, they say privatization doesn't matter.
We'll only get a one-room apartment anyway, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, we were promised to settle, but it didn't go any further.
I'm not used to complaining and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) there was a whole dynasty: my grandparents, my mom and dad, me with my husband and my daughter with my granddaughter.
It's been a while.
Big rats, for example, ran in the kitchen.
Look at the fence walls, they're a foot thick!
They say the solution has been involved in the eggs, so it's been holding on for so long.
The house is well built, thanks to Demidov!
That's probably the only reason anyone's been killed by a collapsing ceiling or a swab.
Only construction is slowly dying in front of us: the boards and logs of the house rot, the floors fail repeatedly, we pour cement, but it's useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say it is - beneath our room is a secret loophole and a walk to the White River, which was deliberately made by the old men who once lived here to escape the danger, in which case.
They were followed.
Ludmila Starstina tells them how some historian came to them, begged him to let him start digging in the apartment.
And then he convinced them to give them the space in exchange for his one-piece on October's Avenue.
Ludmila refused to the historian:
Where are the four of us together?
And there's a little hope here that they'll give you more space.
If we agreed to a trade, nothing would have won.
However, the Old Men's family won nothing.
Ludmila's biggest dream to be settled, and a daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families have allocated a two-room apartment instead of the less majestic ruins that two generations now live in.
A pretty, miniature girl, Olesa Karsakova, from apartments Nos. 11 and 12, shows the second floor of the house.
There are two small rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, where her large family lives.
There's seven of us, two kids.
You can see what the conditions are.
The piece falls off, like the window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms, throughholes.
The water in the tap is only cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of Ufa's oldest house, one can see that the most fortunate are the wives of Lavrentiev from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
A 75-square space, three people are prescribed.
We live in those rooms where Suvorov was legendaryly staying during his stay in Ufa, says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing is, everybody's cracking at the stitches, falling apart, falling apart.
Neighbors must have told you!
The most torments we have with the floors are the wooden boards rotted, the earth literally walked from under our feet.
I've set up the slings, the clinya; there's nothing in the hall, and in the other room, we're going like swings, so shaky.
The house of merchant Yevdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can tell better than any guide.
Gold industry is treated like its own, speaks of it with admiration.
Indeed, the identity was extraordinary: the owner of the Kagin and Uzian factories built houses, poured guns and bells, and held Ural mines.
The heirs of the merchant property are proud of the ancestor, but they don't want to live under the same roof with history anymore.
I settled here as a child, in the 1940s, says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden carriages, stables, and guard booths around, then demolished.
They wanted to clean up our house in 1968, but something prevented...
History repeated in 2014: again, new housing was lured.
As a team, we collected all the documents, ran the right places, and suddenly found out that moving to the apartments was being moved to 2015 or 2016.
I don't believe in all this anymore.
Two years ago, he went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The officials didn't accept the tenant.
It was sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, it was issued without signature and printing: "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the settlement of the tenants."
I even feel like our house isn't in the city's plan for a long time now that it was number 57, then it was 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like it was demolished in the '70s.
The "Russian Planet" approached the head of the information and analysis sector of the Ufa Land Administration, Vladimir Barabash.
A house on October Revolution 57/1 is included in the resettlement programme of dilapidated housing.
I can't be responsible for the actions of officials in the '70s, I just know there was a plan at the time to demolish all the old houses, despite their historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities to rebuild all old houses on the October Revolution Street, which are of architectural value, is being successfully implemented.
Residents are soon to be resettled in new apartments.
According to Barabash, the Dom Demidov will be rebuilt by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
There is now an architectural biennale in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there, among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Old Kazan Street will be restored, says the official.
Houses will acquire a proper form, similar to the one used to be, three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to be an open museum.
In addition, a decision has been taken at the government level to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
Unfortunately, it won't work on a weekday, too busy in the city.
Settle people from the future museum Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same space as the current ones.
Only from another era.
There's been a forest fire in Primorje due to a thunderstorm.
The dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire in the hunting area of the Pozhar district of the Primorsky Province.
At the site of the fire, a grouping of forces and assets is being built.
According to the management of the Maritime Air Base, the conditions at the scene of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Head of Air Base:
A fire in a hard-to-reach area found an observer pilot on board an An-2 patrol aircraft in an area of 3 hectares.
There's wood residue on the old burner.
The heavy area debris and steep slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable landing grounds for firemen pose significant difficulties in extinguishing.
We need an MI-8 helicopter.
The deployment of the Force by the Mi-2 helicopter and the AN-2 aircraft at its disposal is very difficult.
After the fire was discovered, four fire parachutists were promptly planted at the extinguishing site.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and to prepare a site for the delivery of additional fire-extinguishing equipment.
In the lunch area, an additional 3 paratroopers were brought to the village of Hunter.
As soon as the landing site of the helicopter in the fire area is ready, the specialists will be moved to the extinguishing site, as reported on the website of the Administration of the Maritime Province.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the seven children born to Jamaican immigrants to Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses comedy, Rudy's Red records, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew from a series of Radio 4 assists.
The soundtrack is a mix of ruggy and rap, and the tunes are lively.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was "a lot" of treatment, and Henry often ponders his relationship with his father.
It was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the form of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket punch.
I've never talked to him like that.
He was such a non-smiling guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a foundry shop in Dudley and, although conditions had become better than in his father's day, he was able to see what his life must have been like.
It's a little bit better now, but it's dark, smokey, deep mazes of hell with flashes of fire and smoke and piles of soot.
My father climbed into the bath and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing to himself because he wanted to wash himself away from the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he'd done it for years and years to earn us a living, and I'd appreciate it more.
Nevertheless, Henry came out of his childhood without parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got sick at the end of her life did we start saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with French, who he was married to for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother herself had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very well and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started a serious phytenso class, and I also had to take a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
Henry's change of career trajectory is reflected perhaps in his noble, short-cut beard.
Ever since he was recognised by critics for his Othello, he has fully immersed himself in the theatre.
Followed by August Wilson's "Embarkation of Errors" and then "The fences."
This work is different from sitcoms and comedys, which were an indispensable attribute of his rich professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him parodying on stage, and wrote about him in New Faces.
His career in television began in the mid-seventies: "I was the only black parody/comic on television for a long time."
He went to work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny at the New Faces in 1975
As his manager was entitled to the Black and White Menstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "blacked their face", Henry discovered that he had performed in it for five years.
My family didn't like it very much.
I kind of wish it never happened to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked in large venues and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "the award-winning light entertainment classic on British television years and years" was also "a grotesque parody on black people."
Representing the characters who were both mocking and singing black culture in the UK, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the eighties.
The first season of Lenny Henry's Show was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock of the comedy series Chef!
Advertising videos, documentaries, television series, and movie roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv", he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're pulling time or turning away slowly."
Next was a series of documentary shows on Radio 4, entitled "What's good about...?
The first was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I can't be said to be taught that in school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of middle-class white people with tights and cabbage at the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You need to try.
Don't fight it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of those words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for documentary transmission, and he got caught.
I had a feeling I could do it.
It's like my head was straightened out.
"That's what it is, it's a big deal, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
So, the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it on.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started "The Comede of Errors."
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical malfunction, and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to entertain the public.
"A quiet voice inside me said, "You'll have to work ten minutes while they fix the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the presentation would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You play in the play, stay in the role."
Henry at the fences at the Dashes Theatre.
It was hard to learn the text for the fences.
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens muscle.
She was also well accepted, so it was like a sign from above showing, "That's what you should be doing."
He says it, of course, in a groovy voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has a comedian's mind-- all the way to our conversation is interrupted by flashes of his humor when he starts, he finishes parodying.
I just decided not to work in a stand-up because this thing with the instant reward of a full room full of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you want to do this all the time, it could be a dead end.
I sometimes work at The Right Air in Apollo when I want to, but mostly I don't get as much fun as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll ever give a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever want to give it up.
So this is his new embodiment?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice fun thing to do.
You always tell a story, and it's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all government employees in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government's payroll.
Staff members who are not registered in the next two weeks will no longer be paid in a government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyata promised to reduce corruption in State structures after taking power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700000) per month is lost by payments to “invisible workers” and other financial irregularities.
The Government suspects that salaries continue to flow into bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, is reported by BBC reporter Vanyam Chebusiri of the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants are required to report to identification centres within the next two weeks in order to ensure that their data are collected by biometric registration procedure is reported in a government statement.
Anyone who fails to do so without a valid reason will be struck off the payroll and reported.
“This procedure will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government - hence put an end to the problem of invisible workers”, said Ann Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary for Planning and Restructuring of Power.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with the “contest” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “convening against the Government”, reports local news agencies.
The police did not comment immediately on this information.
The detainees included 14 high-ranking officers, according to Harriet Daley News.
Some of them were involved in corruption detection activities last December, which were aimed at vetting government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and listening to a telephone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (who was then Prime Minister) defined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer vacation.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenius Yazenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told expecting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony took place in not every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
All Ukraine, a huge Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, the principal of the school in Slavyansk, to which Yazenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of study is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons, and giving flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead's face, the BBC may have found such an impressive leader she needs.
It is followed by a fame plume from the world of banking, media administration, and internal Tori Party circles.
Indeed, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at a consulting firm for the global management of Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and in the media world at Pearsons.
She was head of the Financial Times for seven years, retiring when a senior position in the head company of Pearson's took over by a male colleague who held a lower position.
They say her earnings are close to £1 million.
Her political ranking is also strong.
She was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall: she became cabinet advisor.
Her husband was Tori's former advisor.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman's work a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the very heart of public life, but its structure has an inherent paradox.
The Council has two orientations: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but out as the voice of public concern and excitement when something goes wrong.
It is an almost unattainable duopoly that requires complete radical reform.
However, what new chairman would risk coming in, disintegrating and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he was to deprive himself of his job in this process.
It's a tough decision.
It wouldn't be that hard, many people would be happy to see the BBC go down in size, after its powers, finances and status have been revised.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, inevitable licensing negotiations pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British acquire a stake in the definitely greatest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it states that its work covers 96 percent of households and costs each of them only 40p a day.
Moreover, it is clear that Beeb's popularity is increasing: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC's models of viewing and use have changed: now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on the iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope it found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone else.
The tweet from the confirmed Texas Governor's account Republican Rick Perry on Sunday night contained an offensive image of the D.A. of Democrats who is at the center of prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and followed by another from Perry's account, in which the recording was disproved.
A tweet has just been published from my account that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I've removed it," reports a later recording.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to the messages with a request for comment.
Although records were downloaded from Perry's confirmed account, it was not clear who was actually publishing on that tape.
An earlier tweet contained an unflattering cartoon on Travis Rosemary Lemberg County Attorney, who was found guilty of driving intoxicated in April 2013.
Perry banned funding for her department when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The signature on the tweet reads, "I don't always drive a car in a state of intoxication three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me that."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lemberg's department did not conduct an investigation involving a grand jury against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ruse.
His powerful legal team asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law that is used to prosecute the governor who has been performing his duties the longest in Texas history would be vague, which is contrary to the constitution.
Perry stopped funding of $7.5 million from the state's funds to the State Department of Public Control, which is based in Travis County and pursues corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
Veto caused an official complaint from a left-wing public monitoring group.
The tape of Perry's confirmed account is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming to the party's fifth convention in Iowa during its 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he could withdraw from the game by tweeting a picture of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to a "normal state"
One of London's most famous developers warned that the real estate market in southeastern England had turned to normal activity.
Houses in the capital were subject to lively demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble would push Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pijley, founder and chairman of Berkeley's elite construction company, said on Monday, "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal levels of transactions since the peak of 2013, adding that this provided a "stable working environment".
The London real estate market succeeded during the recession as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
The city's prices jumped 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to the Land Registry, significantly surpassing the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices on Berkeley's private, affordable, and student schemes increased by about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential mansion tax before the general election next May.
The London Real Estate Agency Foxtons last week warned that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced stricter loan conditions, would also lead to a decline in market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling on the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its projection of rising London real estate prices for 2015 to 3 per cent, based on the fact that real estate prices have already begun to weaken.
Meanwhile, transaction volumes fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, demand for houses in the capital has been very beneficial to Berkeley, raising sales volumes above £2.2 billion.
Mr. Peedley added, "The demand for the right product with good design and better location remained the same and, reflecting this, sales for the time being remained."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year until the end of April, almost one third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
The annual income before taxes rose by 40 per cent from the previous year to £380 million, and income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking in front of the company's annual meeting on Monday, Mr. Pijley reported that Berkeley's expected revenues for this year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of the analysts, profits are expected for the whole year before taxes of £450 million are paid.
Berkeley's stock value was held at £23.96 in the afternoon on the London exchange.
Photos of nude Jennifer Lawrence published online by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual American Film Academy Awards.
Photographs of nude actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar Award, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to possess a "catalogue" of photographs of another 100 rising stars.
A spokesman for the Star of the Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real, and condemned the hacker for "a blatant invasion of personal space."
There's been a call to law enforcement, and they're going to pursue anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photos originally posted on the 4chan photo exchange site are believed to have been obtained due to a lack of online storage system Apple iCloud, and the alleged "catalogue" of victims of hacking includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rianna, Kim Cardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is not clear how many of these photos are genuine, although Scott Pilgrim's star against everyone, Winstead on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"The one who looks at the photos that my husband and I took a few years ago when we were alone at home, I hope you're proud of yourself," tweeted Winstead on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and Victory Winner series denied that she had written on the photos, tweeting: "These are the so-called photos of me naked FALSHIVKI, PEOPLE.
Let me stop it in the embryo.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos on which she was believed to be authentic.
Exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J", which gave rise to the praise of critics
They dissolved, best to say so, they gradually fell like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only on occasion did a woman tell him that he was too serious, too hard to communicate, tense, closed, and perhaps a little irritating.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw himself as irritating.
He was a thorn like a hedgehog, yeah.
The last victim of this barbarity was a small novel from which he expected more than usual, to escape a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a tremblingly fragile beauty with trembling hair and a trembling heart from the northern island village, even further distant and harsher than Port Royben.
She came south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevern regarded as her aunt, with the latter inheriting a house in raw, but similar to a paradise valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes were leaking, spiders sitting still in the baths, slugs leaving their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was weededed with weeds similar to giant kale of cabbage.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, at the same time frightening and enchanting, with a complete secret garden.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the Long List of the Booker Prize in 2014.
Shortlist to be announced next week
Kevern and Eileen were sitting by their hands, in broken schezlongs among the tall grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; they both gleaned to a cheap console that supplied the country with peaceful music and comforting news when, looking at her crossed brown legs, he remembered an old song by a long forgotten black performer whom his father loved to listen by putting the curtains down in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer lost on the console.
They weren't banned - nothing was actually banned - just they weren't lost anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the very word "archaic."
Public taste did something that could never have been achieved by orders and regulations, and just as among books people chose memoirs of rich people who grew up in poverty, cooking books and love novels, of all the music they chose ballads.
Fascinating this day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and a rough comic voice singing Eileen's big legs.
Eileen didn't understand.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he said to her, with two fingers in his lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it flies off his lips.
It started with a game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start with "J," forget to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't a lot of fun now.
He knew he was supposed to do it, that's all.
He had to explain jazz.
Eileen never heard him.
Jazz didn't play either, although it wasn't openly banned.
Improvisation's out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the tune started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with wit.
His unpredictability was making people nervous.
And jazz was witty, expressed through music.
Although he reached the age of 10, never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, which meant that each segment of it agreed with the gratitude -- the gratitude of those who had saved their destiny -- with the principle of group predisposition.
Afro-Caribbean people, by temperament and physical characteristics, were well suited to entertainment and sports, and they sang and ran.
The Indostanians, as if naturally talented in everything about electronics, took action to ensure that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was doing sanitary work; what was left of the Greek hit the plate.
The Persian Gulfers and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not leave the country quickly, when what had been produced had been done, had feared that they would be accused of inflamming the flames, fearing, in fact, that the flames would devour them next, opened restaurants with labes and shackles, kept their heads down and longed for idleness.
Every man in his power.
Since she had only heard ballads before, Eileen was hard to understand how offensive words that Kevern had just sung to her could be put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except maybe for people with big feet.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the garden that was launched gave him the illusion of safety.
No word could penetrate the soundproofing of giant leaves like cabbages.
Eileen didn't understand anyway.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to press two fingers against her lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She untrustingly shook her head, closing Cavern's eyes.
There was nothing in the whole world but a dig of her sinus-black hair.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining in her opinion.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say, no.
My ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you have thick ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so perverted.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to make jokes often led him into awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty that was stained in the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to, too, Kevern.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and rose from the schezlong, overturning the console and strait of the wine they drank.
Buzine wine, so intoxication couldn't justify it.
In her excitement, she seemed to shiver like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you because you have a stupid head," she said...
I don't like it, though.
He felt sorry for her and for the excessive rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She did not talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that in the basics she was like the one here.
The same huge ice ocean fell on both of them.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and cranky after the one that had been produced, had been produced like their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand against any woman who had dared to deny them or tease them.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
First you would kiss - the kiss is now the most common expression of erotic annoyance between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads that gave away the console - first kiss her and then hit her.
The over-examining, in the view of Cavern, is because the kiss itself was already hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons showed by body that he needed to leave.
He came up from a schezlong like an old man.
She felt the weight of lead, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him walk away, and from the top window she watched him go away, her companion was a man himself who had shouldered his own burdens.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt compassion for him and the men at all, even though some of them raised their hand against her.
The man who turned his back on her, embarrassed, fought, all the ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember any of the cases, until today, when she would have seen it?
Again, Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or so on, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Ofnau, an informal public sentiment control service, produced a small report on the persistence of low and medium levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decrease if it did not stop altogether, given the means and forces allocated to its eradication.
"Many things have been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggression of people who fought in thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these tangled branches and narrow dispersals of the area where, despite the spire of churches floating over fences, the tender breath of human kindness was rarely felt in all history.
However, some qualities are proving to be inexorable.
The higher the spire seems to be, the lower the passions it gives rise to.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories of overcome obstacles, and declares its fierce belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only old roughness retains its strong grip in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is also evidence that new and vicious bullying is emerging in homes, workplaces, roads, and even playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate habit of writing too much," said her science director, reading the whole report.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum dropped her head.
I should also ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," finally said Luther Rabinowitz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
There's no prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and commendable in itself, can sometimes distort the results, like the ones you've shown me.
Obviously, you're prejudiced against the church yourself, and what you call "evil" and "gross" would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To continue to want to know what has been produced, if it has been produced, as if it had happened, if at all, yesterday, is to deprive the country of the life force it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, pink like flamingo, LED letters repeated the advice that Ofnau gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your husband, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talk is better than silence, the word of the song is better than the word written, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you're saying," replied Esme Nussbaum quietly when she made sure her science manager was finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything but that we haven't cured ourselves as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I'm concerned that if we're not ready, we'll find that we're repeating the mistakes that originally led to what's been done, if it's been done.
Only this time, we will throw our anger and mistrust away on no one else.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips together in a pyramid.
This gesture was meant to mean endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "calling "mistakes" acts that our grandfathers did or didn't do.
You go too far and talk about how they threw their anger and distrust at other people.
In your place, a man should not need a reminder that, understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we do not talk about "us" or "they."
There was no "us" and no "others."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"For which, to be honest with herself," dared to insert Esme, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what's done is done.
It was then.
You don't have to say anything else, we agree.
And as much as you don't have to blame anyone, you don't have to justify it if it was appropriate or if something could be fixed.
But why the past, if not to learn--
The past exists for us to forget it.
If I can add one word to that,
Luther Rabinitz's pyramid fell apart.
"I'll look at your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who went to the sidewalk as described by passers-by, "in an evil rage."
Coincidents happen.
Lesotho Army states that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Representatives of the Lesotho Army denied that a coup was being prepared to overthrow the Government, claiming that they had acted against the police, who was suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the country's army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in Maseru capital.
The Premier took his family to neighboring South Africa, claiming to have received the threat of an attempt on his life.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi stated that there was no, in fact, a coup, but that the army responded to the threat from the "political fanatics" that the police tried to arm.
"What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action after receiving several intelligence reports that there were some elements within the police force that were really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were willing to cause chaos," he told the Voice of America.
A spokesman for the South African government, Clayson Monjela, stated that the army's actions looked like a coup.
“Although no one has claimed the taking of power by force, according to all accounts, the actions of the Lesotho Armed Forces so far have the main signs of a coup”, he said.
The Lesotho Army reported that the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing administers the government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabane stated that he believed he was being attacked in an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in his unified Government.
He stated that his actions had not undermined the Government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea quarterback Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on loan at Milan, reports Milan Channel.
A 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the next hours for medical examination.
In the past season, he only went to the field as part of the London club three times.
Let's remind you that Milan used to rent from Liverpool's attacker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at the lowest level in 13 months
The growth of output in the eurozone slowed to the lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The last value of the euro area's business activity index (PMI) for the market fell to 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed, and businesses suffered among the growing tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
Values came before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will expect a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with the halt in the eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation of only 0.3 per cent.
It is suggested that ECB leader Mario Dragi may give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although any growth is better than no growth at all, the brake effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers becomes more evident," said Rob Dobson, Senior Economist Markit.
The PMI of the production sector of Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest 51.4 in 11 months.
Meanwhile, in the second-largest economy of the bloc, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of great concern, as does Italy's weakening from sustained growth to stagnation.
Signs that the growth momentum has faded mainly from the industrial engine, Germany, and Spain and the Netherlands also do not add confidence," said Mr. Dobson.
The slowdown in industry is likely to add oil to the fire for analysts awaiting the introduction of additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist of IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing to say about the August study of the eurozone's productive sector business index is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The eurozone's producers obviously find life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension – especially those related to Russia/Ukraine – adds uncertainty to still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension obviously hit business – and especially consumer confidence – and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that "more and more like," that the ECB would, of course, have to make some kind of quantitative easing, "although we suspect it will be limited."
The people of Mariupole will put out a live chain against the militia.
In Mariupole, until last week, it was quiet - no one was torn to organize the Mariupole People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are fearfully waiting for the militia to arrive.
According to political scientists, separatists break into Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - the town of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which was not part of the self-proclaimed republics either.
The Mariupols decided that the Ukrainian army, while defending them, had little strength against the excellent armed representatives of the DNR-LNR, and were going to help the military.
They dig trenches, build roadblocks and fortifications.
On the evening of Saturday, several thousand residents arrived at the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a living chain singing Ukraine's anthem.
They're going to do the same if they do.
Volunteers collect and transport equipment and products, collect medicines, and publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closed, banks and ATMs are shut down.
Ten Years of Hell for Beslan's Survivors: Ten Years From the Horrible Occupation of School, Like Children Who Get Into It Still Wounds
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial, which shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who faked death during the school atrocities.
Exactly ten years after the terrible takeover of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, heroicly surviving the disaster warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed to be some sort of extreme evil.
Tragedy united the east and the west in disgust, which miraculously then developed into action and hope for the future in the face of the greatest grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who deceived death during the school atrocities.
We have found amazing young people who have faced the scourge, although memories of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that now plagues Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now cease.
The girl in the picture is trying to get back into the shooting gym.
It is captured in a picture of famous Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov when in one linen she tried to climb back into the shooting gym after the mine exploded.
In a confused state, Aida desperately sought out her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them had died, but they actually survived.
"Woman told me to run as hard as I could, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and crawled back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more surgeries.
There's a few pieces left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people just as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but she certainly didn't break it," she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend who was supposed to be my classmate, Dser Gapoev, was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we wanted to go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about my family later.
She says the takeover stays with her, though the memories get a little dull every year.
I am glad that many people in the world are still mindful of our plight, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from the people of Britain and from all over the world.
When I see on the Internet a picture of me climbing through a school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure it doesn't happen again.
A boy who ran through a hail of bullets, believing his mother was dead.
It was his first day in school (the Russians start school at age 7) and survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She told him to run.
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and along the way saw a crying baby, grabbed the child by the hand, and ran through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damir told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara got out and was in the hospital with injuries on her feet, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said, "I was crying for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (now non-existent newspaper News of the World), where he was awarded as the Protector of Children from the Barnardo's Foundation by Premier Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
After all, I can tell he's in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with the shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played in the yard that never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted, and the ride in an open-top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of grief he and his friends have experienced.
That horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who volunteers at a women's monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to be a police officer someday, and I hope I get enrolled in the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the awful silence right after the capture, there were just no kids screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She vividly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to "Sheri Blair and her foundation for that award and opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sheri and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat the bourgeois, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting them with his water gun, and they ran and played with him.
And it's only been a month since our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I still think this world hasn't gotten any better in 10 years.
There's a war going on in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news report they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy doing something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, not at all aggressive or evil.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not obsessed with this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the gym every now and then and they light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning his back on us for hours.
Didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other war toys.
I find it hard to believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and stand on my feet, I looked back, I saw hell around me when parts of the bodies were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember screaming to him, "Damir, run, run away," but again, I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
This is how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgi Ilyin, 17
A boy whose shocking photograph after the capture became the defining feature of the Beslan tragedy
Rest: survivor Beslan Georgi Ilyin with his mother Fatima after capture in 2004, and on the right George today
On his bloody face was a mark of fear when he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the chief doctor, took him to school on his first day of school before taking Vladimir's eldest son to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy stayed alone for three days of nightmare," she recalled.
Not all alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There's not a day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time before my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
It falls into the soul: Photo by George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in sculpture (right)
I remember George so wanted to go to school that day, he said he wanted to hug a teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of crying George in San Marino.
George doesn't like to see this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but I also think that this picture makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
George now says, "It's important that it never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever find out the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever learn what it was called?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war because it happens?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need tens of years to forget her a little.
It affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago, I had nightmares about the capture, but now I'm feeling better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym before every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'll study to become a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but my health didn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
George Farnieve, 20 years old
A boy who survived despite being at the feet of a murderer terrorist
Unbelievable: George Farnieve was at the feet of a terrorist killer during the capture, but he managed to survive.
During the capture, he was photographed in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murderer terrorist.
Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says George, who wanted to study as an intelligence officer at the FSB, but failed due to damage to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that children are easy to deal with bad things, - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the following year, it was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I passed out.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous photo.
Survivor: George Farnieve today with a laptop-opened picture of himself at the hospital after taking over
My pain is great, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but I'm walking normally now.
But still, health prevented me from going to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my papers, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second crush was animals, so I went to the Veterinary Institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals from cat to cow.
He said, "I know that I will never tell my children about my experience.
It's not something kids should know about, and it's certainly not something they should survive.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary comes.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know George won't go.
For him, she needs to be even stronger because he was there, and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't play sports.
I'd say he's 50 percent over this nightmare, but it's impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and that only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could have given me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what's going on in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I find it hard to believe.
We were a friendly country in the past, how come we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could capture all the rebels and throw them away as far away as you can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10 years old
A baby who was taken to safety by a SWAT fighter.
Rescued: Alyona Tskaev brings to safety a Russian SWAT fighter (left).
Now she's ten (right), and she doesn't remember a terrible crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when little Alyona carried out a Russian police officer from a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but cruelly left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Cristina and brother Mahar in the school's gymnasium.
Mahar, then three years old, was saved, but Alyona's mother and sister died in a deadly slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since married again, and she and his new wife Svetlana have a small daughter, whom he called Christine in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alyona, who is now ten, remembers nothing of the capture and blossoms into a smart and lively girl, says neighbours.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alyona and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Sinji Kagawa's quarterback, who returned from Manchester United to Dortmund's Borussia, noted that he was looking forward to going out to the German club again.
According to him, this transfer is a happy career event.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm going to play for Borussia again, as Bild quotes Kagawa.
I feel really good.
Full of positive emotions and looking forward to going out to the Borussia field again.
Remember, Kagawa moved to MoU from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to consolidate himself into the English club, spending only 38 matches in the England Championships in two seasons, scoring 6 balls and giving 8 assists.
A man is charged with hitting a girl at the footwalk of the "pelican" in Fife.
A 78-year-old man will stand trial on charges of hitting a three-year-old girl at the footwalk of the "pelican" in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl at a crossing in Pittenwin in East Newk.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stewart was leading his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and hit the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stuart, 78, of Anstruster, denied guilt in Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, Queen's Counsel, set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel, and Holland won't cook in Vladivostok.
The Duty Free duty-free store at Vladivostok Airport posted a sign prohibiting shopping at the store by a number of world political leaders.
Don't give them perfume, vodka and cognac.
The store administration decided that US President Barack Obama, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, French President François Holland, Vitaly Clichko, Julia Tymoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other prominent comrades would not be able to cook vodka, cognac and perfume at their store.
And I put a sign on the door.
Previously, Obama had been banned from attending an even less accessible service facility, the Dyetic Catering Office, as reported by the public utility website.
Whether the American president ever dreamed of eating in a diet canteen in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the bans clearly seem awfully witty to themselves.
Is there any cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to the agrarians
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the embargo, Russian agrarians should learn new technologies in order to produce the cheese varieties sought from buyers.
The board was given during a visit to the Supticeprom company of Agrocomplex.
The Head of Government also gave advice to the Restaurants to refocus on Russian meat, the quality of which is at an appropriate level.
Annual food import embargoes have been imposed in Russia since 7 August.
Russia's head coach Valentine Maslakov is pleased with the outcome of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, third place is a good result given the lack of targeted preparation for competitions.
Our athletes performed at their level, saying "All sports" by Maslakov.
Third place is to confirm our reasonably high command level.
It is a pleasure that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
We have to bear in mind that we have not prepared for this competition.
The season is over, and we did not oblige our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we've been second in this tournament, but this season, we've got a new team.
The French, on the contrary, have put out a combatable team comprising 13 European champions.
They have not concealed their intention to win this year, which has been announced many times in public.
But even such a composition of competition owners could not stand up to the Americans.
I therefore believe that Russians have performed in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in order than in the same Diamond League.
The season's over.
Of course, athletes no longer care about the outcome, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing was the place.
And in the results, I agree, it was absurd when, at 1,500 metres, men were so attracted to the tactical tangles of running that they showed the result below the average... of women's races.
4 clues on how to achieve a better quality of underwater photographs and videos
If you want to photograph or film a video underwater, you have a variety of equipment options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a watertight "washhouse", such as Nikon Coolpix AW120, or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for approximately $300.
I took these pictures on a family holiday with several cameras, all at a price of about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Recheck your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof chamber, make sure the chamber battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
In addition, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you will be taking.
Some photo and video cameras have camera modes or object types that optimize exposure for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump in the water, figure out how deep your equipment can go down.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer's leadership and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take off some footage, because many of them won't work.
The soapy girls have a LCD that will help you build up the pictures, whereas the action cameras don't usually have them.
Even if you have a LCD, it'll be hard to see underwater, and the frame layout will be a random process.
So do some footage.
Also, if your camera has a serial camera mode that shoots a few frames with slightly different displays, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The amount of light falls significantly, the deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you take off in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to transmit more color in the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the target.
It's a great advice for land-based photography, but it's even more important underwater because of the dark light conditions.
It's especially important if you're filming an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you're going to have to get close to the objects if you want to fill in the frame.
The bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games in the free struggle of Bilal Mahov may turn into a Greek-Roman struggle.
This was reported by Dagestan's head coach for the Free Fight of Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not exclude the athlete's participation in the Tashkent World Cup in September 2014.
Bilal Mahov is currently in the "classics" team gathering, citing "R-Sport" by Sajid Sajdov.
In fact, Bilal performed in both styles as well.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he became the winner of the volleyball tournament and the third prize in the Greek-Roman competitions and decided to concentrate on the free struggle.
It has long been said that a new phase of our career will be carried out by our heavyweight in the Greek-Roman struggle.
I'll tell you more, Mahov can already compete at the Tashkent World Cup if he wins the make-up.
But the final word is always for the coaching staff led by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality could shake things up, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
A consulting anaesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to freeing patients from both the suffering of disease and the suffering of treatment.
Among those who addressed him, his wife recalled, was an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors are obsessed with diagnosis and disease, those who are receiving treatment mostly worry about something completely different-- pain.
One day in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength in myself.
Fighting flu-like symptoms, he discovered that he was irritatingly blaming his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen faster than later," he said.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson discovered that he was unusual and unexplained why she was upset.
Something wasn't right.
He asked a colleague to do a chest X-ray.
Only two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-ray results came back.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or the sheath of the lungs.
For most cancers, it's hard to figure out the exact cause.
Although some smokers have contracted lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But the mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a fibrous construction material that was once called "the miracle," but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommendation industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: trumpet isolationists, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era, it is hardly a cause for concern today.
But that calm is wrong.
Britain appears to be at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
Here, mesothelioma kills more people than any other country on the planet.
At an annual death rate of approximately 2,500, more than twice as many people die from the disease as from car accidents.
Annual mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason we feel its deadly effects now is that, although asbestos use has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were ultimately prohibited by law in 1999), mesothelioma development usually takes decades.
And attacking mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, buried in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma ignores class, level of wealth, profession, or age.
The Bastion of Chosenness, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, proved not to be a rescue.
The Parliament building is pierced with asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us proved to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a piper.
As a matter of fact, he had to think about where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he realized.
"It seems there could have been a lot of asbestos in tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in internship," he wrote.
All the students, nurses, doctors and movers used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
That was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who interned at Guy's Hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma over the last five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I'm the only one who survived."
How many of us are going to get sick with this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died, on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It's unusual to live for so long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die eight months after diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
So now all we can do is repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are going to get the same disease?"
According to the leading mesothelioma expert in the UK, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely to be expected that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to heal, about 900,000 people will die.
Most people now have no idea they're gonna die like this.

A quick look at court reports, to which victims often seek compensation, shows how far the attack of mesothelioma has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Ellen had been inadvertently exposed to asbestos.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working for M&S.
She now has two children over 20.
"Before it happened," she says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn't think it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They were given their name by the word "asbestiforms", which means a fibrous structure that communicates to them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler sutures, even in brake pads of cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of health damage" that could lead to death.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokidolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are strong, though indirect, reasons to believe that this is the main cause of the exceptionally high number of mesothelioma patients [in Britain]."

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He carried out a study of the patients, which suggests that "a significant percentage of mesothelioma when there is no known impact on work or at home was most likely caused by the exposure of asbestos from the environment."
Most of this impact, he says, is due to the "usual use and impact of weather" on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
Goddard Consulting's report, which examined the Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of the government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibers could be driven by something as harmless as "strong air flows".
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but the opposite seems to be true.
Although the Directorate of Maintenance of Parliament insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “clean health certificate”, it now recognized that there was a need to work on £1 billion to reconstruct Parliament by improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, members of Parliament might sit at the QE2 conference centre near Westminster rather than on Westminster's green benches.
Goddard's report noted that "the asbestos situation was not managed according to different regulations".
It's impossible to know if this control error will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who never managed to detect their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places you've worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009, when he was struck by something that looked like flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of surgery late tonight.
Suddenly, I started to get feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming from pleura, a shell around his lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Eventually, he couldn't go to work for a month.
Obsessed doctors took X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to extract liquid from the lungs and send it for testing.
And yet his condition was undiagnosed.
His health gradually improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms came back, often after he was playing sports and breathing hard.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients entered his waiting room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and the consultant showed his CT results and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between his chest shell and his lung shell.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came in a week between Christmas and New Year's Eve, "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Mesothelioma diagnosed
Suddenly, Abbott sank into meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested that he contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"Asbestos appears to have been widely used, especially in large public buildings where asbestos thermal insulation on pipes was quite frequent," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now infected with the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people in atypical occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos isolated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so patients are unlikely to be affected.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to a toxic substance.
For decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, in theory, life was saved for the patients, but a place that posed a threat to the life of the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolers set their Bunzen burners to asbestos stands
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, stores, libraries and mayors due to their amazing isolation and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in class.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry lessons, students placed their Bunzen burners on asbestos stands.
There have been websites highlighting asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless things like floor tiles or shed roofs generally contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison planted in a vast amount of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in a case against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful with the garden sheds.
The effect of diagnosis, when known to be incurable, is enormous.
"It takes quite a while to realize that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to go and deal with myself.
Well, I won't be seeing Christmas again.
One of the hardest things to do was to move from being a doctor to being a patient.
As an countless number of patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information he had to accept.
"It was hard to understand," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
They gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to meet Christmas anymore.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, because it is the mechanics of how we support life -- the very act of breathing -- that causes cancer that kills.
Most mesothelioma cases are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and the fibers inhal, they can be stuck in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises from inhalation of asbestos needle fibers", Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy Hospital in 2001.
It was the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading mesothelioma treatment center.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely subjected to exposure while interning at the hospital.
When needles of asbestos fall into the tissue of the lungs, Treger says, "The breath pushes them to the periphery where the shell is located.
This is essentially an invasive process from the outset.
Common treatments for other forms of cancer are much less effective in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is highly controversial.
Some people think it's worth a try.
The thriller disagrees.
"Can't cut out the spit," he says.
You can't walk around with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is "not very good at chemotherapy," which "acts" but doesn't cure.
"There are sick people who live long times from time to time," says Treger.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen J Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became a single-person support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said happily when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Abbott was offered six rounds of chemotherapy that would take four months to extend his life for just a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson did, however, "deployed to give a slightly more positive colour to everything."
Meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loick Lange-Lazundski, Professor of Thoractic Surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need a direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," admits Graham.
The average patient would have to be referred and approved for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for mesothelioma patients to get the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment is finally inevitably ineffective, many patients face another financial concern: the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small quantities could put health at risk.
That's when they talked about the bad faith of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a "full cost settlement," according to Morgan, as Lawson failed to clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy's hospital.
After investigating his death, a representative of Guy Hospital confirmed, however, that “the asbestos in the basements in question were removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, linking lethal contact with asbestos to one company or workplace - usually decades after that - has proven to be a major problem for mesothelioma patients who require compensation.
Many of their former employers changed ownership or closed down.
Insurance archives could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves from lawsuits know that theirs is a time that the plaintiffs certainly don't have.
In response this year, serious new legislation has emerged that facilitates mesothelioma patients in obtaining compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under this law, a £350 million fund financed by the insurance industry was established for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but who have no one to sue.
In such cases, patients would receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case, around £120,000.
About 300 successful lawsuits under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes £350 million is a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time interval hadn't interfered and the mesothelioma patients could have traced the companies and sued in the normal way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was "indefinite."
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that while seven people die every day, rapid action was necessary.
"People suffer so much, and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of the Mesothelioma Bill last December.
By then, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Loick Lange-Lazundski for 19 months.
After primary consultation, Lange-Lazundski recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lange-Lazundski can boast of 40 per cent of the survivors in five years.
Abbott felt a rush.
"This is of course one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some kind of power that supports you.
When you give up, the condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott signed up for surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no sign of the disease.
I was then scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots in my chest.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a life threat.
It's the end of life.
Again, Abbott went through six rounds of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of tumors.
However, this process is both physical and emotional.
You can think about practical things - about finance when I die, for example, or about showing my wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you're not happy.
We need to look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamsin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I first got diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I can't live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very social and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
This kind of conversation is something everyone with cancer has to face.
But for mesothelioma patients, such discussions are not balanced by hope, not even by the speck of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as ultimately for Stephen Jay Gould) dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "the mesothelioma is not a threat to life.

Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health damage caused by contact with asbestos in the UK.
Global asbestos production grows to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The UK Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety requires that all contractors working with asbestos be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All use of asbestos is banned in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act is adopted in the United Kingdom.
The £350 million compensation scheme has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
World production is maintained at approximately 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters vow revenge
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections despite the growing demands of democratic reform.
Such a move is likely to trigger a long-awaited protest in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People's Congress of China essentially allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't deceive our expectations, but still rages," said the lawmaker Emily Lau, Democratic Party chairman.
It's not what Beijing promised.
They tricked Hong Kong's people.
And obviously we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defending China's decision, Lee Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said it would be too "chootic" to allow a popular nomination for the election of Hong Kong's leader.
Since 1997, when the UK handed over control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to elect a head of government by vote, starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands through a nomination commission tightly controlled from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision was made after the summer, when some of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong occurred over the years.
Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to shut down Hong Kong's financial area if Beijing did not guarantee real universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstrations, the organizers stated that their movement was moving into a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise on the waves of protest in the following weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently seeking to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “considered the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can be taken only if all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other option.
It is with great regret that we report that, to date, all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and that the seizure of the central area will no doubt take place.
Public authorities in Hong Kong had been preparing for Beijing's application for several days, and security measures had been strengthened at Government headquarters on Sunday, with the involvement of the police and the barricades.
The riots are based on the feeling in many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
Inflows from the mainland increase competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that its demonstrations put the business, the source of Hong Kong's life force, at risk.
"The protest they're talking about can result in a great economic loss depending on how many people will be involved and how long," said legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want concerns about Hong Kong getting out of control to spread.
It's a perception that's harmful to investment.
Chinese state media have also reported in recent days, in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement have been shown to be subversives sent by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands came to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
American prom culture reaches university life: freshmen were invited to arrive on a private jet
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the UK's first "lux"-class travel service for current students.
To give a bright impression from arriving at the university, the company also offers transport options such as a private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin, or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service was thinking about safety.
This service is the ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their things across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping this year's students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury.
A representative of the company reported that, since the service had just been launched, no orders had yet been received, but added that "students would start ordering the service in the next few weeks."
The company also stated that despite the fact that students have to pay £900 per year for their studies, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Today's students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and expectations: it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized this service as detached from reality.
Megan Dunne, NSS Vice President for Higher Education, said, "This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start university this month face a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants does not keep up with the rapidly increasing expenditure on basic needs, before they can begin to think at all about taking thousands of pounds out of some sort of mere arrival in a dormitory.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behaviour after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri earlier this month.
Those who come lift their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot" while they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of Michael Brown's unarmed teenager, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the Internet conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments placed gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tension increased in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw responses from white women, which focused on 100 per cent race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the 9 August murder, personal essays with headlines such as "thinking of Ferguson on behalf of a white woman" and "Feminism isn't just about oppression of women" came up relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic for the crisis we're facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so related to race, they felt it needed to be pointed out.
For a professor of English at Ohio State University, Corita Mitchell Ferguson exposed the problems black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and get 150 likes from everywhere," Mitchell says.
When I write something about how colored people are being attacked in their own country, silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public sphere?" she asks.
For black women, like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
In her view, black women were in a position to clearly separate those problems; they faced a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine race and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"At least 10,000 black men were lynched between 1865 and 1890, and this was almost always based on the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
It took a white woman to confirm the story to justify the lynching.
From Hattery's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragists, such as Susan B. Anthony, examined the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the election struggle would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in a women's voting basket, and the right to vote for blacks should have appeared later," Hattery told them.
Looking back on these things gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained voting rights in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynchings in the Southern Women's Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell's point of view, the rise of white feminists' reactions to the issues raised by the situation in Ferguson - the behaviour of the police, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to catch up with the problems black women have dealt with in generations.
"Really, it would be great if activists who have such [traditional feminist] ideology would take as seriously the right to raise a child as they regard the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
The second wave feminists, who have made careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what that means.
Famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem, two weeks after Michael Brown's murder, took advantage of Facebook and published a sharp article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans be more involved in racist protests.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger of the body - and the viewpoints on racial issues that differ significantly in public surveys - will be at the head of change," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem is charged with a more intersecting feminism that includes both race and gender issues, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
American Business Institute researcher Christine Sommers, author of "Who stole feminism?", said She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, were "far more vulnerable than their sisters", but Stein's remarks about Ferguson contradicted the criticism she had previously voiced.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, My Brother's Struggle, to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking youths, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
Police relations with the black community are not the only problem promoting traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's south-west border this year, immigration reform came back to the surface, this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to bring the problem as important to women, she only had to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of working visas are granted to [male immigrants], women who come with them find themselves in a position that is vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are resonating with women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich house "with pig" sold
A photo of the house displayed for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out to depict a large pig resting in the living room.
Sold for £120,000, a separate house with one bedroom stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description featured a photograph of the living room of the house, depicting a pig with a head resting on the couch.
The Connells Real Estate Agency reported that the pig in the photo is the home favorite of the owner of the house.
"One photo, however, was placed by mistake and has already been deleted," said a representative of the company.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as "a unique separate house with one bedroom".
Although the agency removed the photo from its website, it is still stored in promotional material.
The sale of the house generated interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was being sold with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in a fourth-round US Open match yielding Carolyn Wozniatsky, believes she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to complete the year with dignity and try to reach a new level, conveys Vasily OSIPOV from New York.
How do you generally evaluate your results at the Big helmet tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I managed to win the Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially in the endings of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn't even get to the quarterfinals.
What are your goals until the end of the season?
After a hurtful defeat, I have a huge motivation to step up to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do my best to complete the year with dignity.
The Asian series of tournaments begins in a couple of weeks.
Member of the State Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuev has proposed to give bonuses on entry into higher education for complying with GTO standards.
He said that, in general, the standards would be the same as in Soviet times, that people would give up standards for pull-up, running, and other exercises.
Let us recall that 12 Russian entities will begin implementing GTO standards on 1 September in their territory.
I also offered to the students who gave up the GTOs to give bonuses on entry into higher education, as noted by the Valuev.
For example, they can add a little bit of scoring to the EGE.
There are also suggestions to give additional weekend workers of enterprises who have undergone these sports trials.
A new millionaire appeared in Harvey City in South Wales after winning the lottery.
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
A new millionaire is being sought southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will take home almost $1.1 million from a lottery game on Saturday night.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey brings gold in the main prize play for the second time in five years, the last winning was $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to make a statement.
The owner of the shop, Steve Forward, said that the winnings caused agitation in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole town's talking about it, and everyone's very excited.
We thought it might be a secret.
Eight Western Australian winners celebrated the winnings of the main prize last month, marking the completion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires of August, following a huge $7.5 million win for a couple from Belmont just weeks before.
The winning couple had been playing for 20 years and reported that the winnings had given them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new house.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of West Australian top prize winners to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Mineconomism wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market.
This week, Mineconom Development will introduce to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, and told the deputy director of the department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov on a round table held by Vedomosti at the Moscow Motor Show 2014.
The plan was commissioned by the Government and one of the main objectives was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September and early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures relate to electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of gas-fuelled vehicles in Russia already exists.
The plan (copy available from Vedomosti) is for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport are to be developed and how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the Government describing tax and customs support measures for electrical transport will be prepared by December 2014; a concession credit and concession lease scheme will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of machinery, promote localization and establish service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014 - 2015, it is planned to amend the regulations to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (parks, petrol stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to propose to the regional authorities during 2015 that they should also encourage the use of clean transport, in the form of an advantage in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016, proposals to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, the Ministry of Environmental Development will, by October 2014, include in the list of indicators to measure the performance of regional authorities, criteria reflecting the effectiveness of supporting cleaner transport production and the development of charging infrastructure.
The Russian electric vehicle market is still forming - about 100 electric vehicles sold throughout the country in 2013.
In early 2014, the import duty on electric vehicles was zeroed, so sales would be about 500 grand, predicted by the Chief Executive Officer of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
But a five-fold increase does not make electric cars any visible: in 2013, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million passenger and light commercial cars were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles to Russia.
Renault is being prepared to start imports - the company focuses primarily on corporate customers, says Renault Strategic Planning and Partnerships Director in Russia Nicolas Remiz.
Most other electric transport producers, however, have taken a wait-and-see position with regard to Russia.
Russian manufacturers also have "", GAZ, but the output is small.
For example, between January and July 2014, according to ASM Holding, AutoWAZ released 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the director of AutoWAZ in engineering Sergei Amanov, without the upper hand, there will be no breakthrough in this segment...
The development of the Russian electric vehicle market, in addition to the expensive cars (those electric vehicles sold in Russia, on average twice as expensive as internal combustion engines), constrains the development of the charging infrastructure (fuelling units), and the respiration of the director-general of Autostat, Sergei Slykov.
Due to the high cost and low pace of the reduction in the cost of electric vehicles over the next three to four years, it will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, forecast by the editor-in-chief of Avtorevu, Mikhail Podrozhansky, who is agreed to by Allkov.
On the contrary, automakers say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of conventional vehicles.
The Russian electric vehicle market has good prospects, and the most important is to build consumer confidence that “electric mobility” is real; this will be facilitated in particular by the emergence of more charging stations, as pointed out by the President of the BMW group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by Rosetti: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon be available.
Discussions are under way to build a network of gas stations with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofiyin, director of the Rossetey department, the company believes in the market for electric vehicles and is ready to build gas stations across the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of various brands.
In addition, Rossetti, as a network company, is not authorized to sell electricity, and the possibility of charging electric vehicles is being explored.
Pankov believes that the most effective measure to discourage the formation of an electric vehicle market in Russia is the elimination of customs duties.
The zero rate will remain in place until the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it and expanding the preferential list is being considered.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environment (the idea is discussed and applies to all machines) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, is considered by Pankov.
Transport taxes in Russia are small, Pankov says, unlike Norway, for example, where tax cuts have led to a sharp increase in the sales of electric vehicles - they now account for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia, there is also a need for incentive measures for car owners, such as free parking in the city centre (as already done in Moscow), sure Pankov, or the possibility of electric vehicles moving along the allocated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
A single-engine Piper PA-46 crashed in the U.S. state of Colorado.
Three of the five people in it died, hands over ITAR-TASS.
The survivors have been taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometres from the Denver airport runway.
The causes of the tragedy are now being identified.
The Donetsk region deals with the captives of the Donbass battalion.
The jailers were surrounded by Ilowaiski.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of silos died under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation really was in south-eastern Ukraine, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky ones.
The Donbass Battalion's gunmen were alive after the meat they hit under Ilowayski.
In the midst of the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, the militants spent a few days effectively abandoned by their commanders and the Ukrainian authorities.
When it was reported from the headquarters that the "kick" could be pulled out of the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But just a few minutes later, there were shells and bullets on all sides.
"On the basis of the information they gave me, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," says the deputy battalion commander, who has a "Lermont" call sign.
And when we went down to the bottom between Polypole and Cervonosel, we started to crossfire from anti-tank guided missiles, from guns, 30-millimetre grenade launchers, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three in the back, and there were only two cars left.
An officer named "Lermontov" tells us that almost immediately at least 60 people died, dozens were injured, and many died later.
The survivors are now being treated by those they came to kill.
The prisoners are now surprised that the so-called “terrorists” treat them well, provide food, medicine.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and condemned them to certain death.
They said, "We have been betrayed.
The column, the entire battalion, to be destroyed.
To the Donbass battalion, like many of his comrades, Alexey volunteered because Ukrainian news spoke of atrocities that were allegedly committed by “separatists” in the south-east.
Alexey's already seen a different picture here.
His mother in Luhansk was killed, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that mortar fire was going on, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, one of the soldiers, Alexei, told me.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
They didn't let us out of Iloweisk, they said we were in the ring.
I've already made a deal with the commander, the report has already written about the departure.
We were taken from our tolls to Iloweisk.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people are stuck in the "cot" under Ilowayski.
Some survivors now admit that if time could be reversed, they would never join the punitive battalion.
All the prisoners were handed over by the militia to the DNR silos.
Everyone will be tested for involvement in war crimes.
A food price control headquarters has been established in the region
A headquarters has been set up in Krasnoyar Province to limit, if necessary, the increase in the price of products in the region ' s market.
The decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The staff consisted of members of the Government of the province, representatives of the executive branch and oversight agencies.
Together, they will monitor agricultural prices in the province.
The Economic Watch - Will Kiev "Rosnefti" recover $140 million in damages?
The head of Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, stated that the company estimated the damage caused by the shooting of the Lisican NDP in Ukraine at $140 million.
He reported this in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government to pay compensation," Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the Lisican NDP, which had been upgraded by Lisican, was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fighting there, there were no 'student rebels', but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, technological oil pumped into the pipes has gone missing," he said.
As will be recalled, on 18 July, the oil storage tank was burned down in connection with the shelling of the Lisican NDP and the buildings of the two warehouses were destroyed.
The Liciccan NDP is the main refinery in Ukraine, the first phase of which was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisiccan NEP is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is capable of producing Euro 4 fuel as well as Euro 5 fuel lots.
In March 2012, oil deliveries to the Lisican PNP were suspended due to its loss.
At the plant, it was decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisican NDP along with other Ukrainian assets of TNCs-VR.
The DPRK launched a short-range missile towards the Japanese Sea.
According to South Korean media, this happened around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando Province, which is on the North Korean-China border.
As Interfax was told in the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, the missile reportedly landed in the Japanese Sea after flying some 220 kilometres.
The ruble falls against the background of geopolitical pressure
On the Moscow Exchange, the dollar grew at the opening by 3 cops to 37.15 rubles, and the ruble fell to the bicurate basket against a backdrop of geopolitical tensions.
ETS tenders for the dollar started transactions at the borders of 37.11–37.2 roubles/$1, an average of two minutes, the rate is fixed at 37.16 roubles/$1, which is 4 cops above the level of the previous closure.
The euro had a rate of 48.79 rubles for 1 euro, which is 3 cops above the level of the previous closure.
The price of the bi-currency basket added 3.5 cops to 42.395 rubles.
The United States dollar is traded 23 cops above the official rate, and the euro 16 cops above the official rate.
The Russian market continued its rapid decline on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He continued to be cheap and the ruble and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are now pre-empting the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
So far, however, this is more like an artificial hysteric bloated through the media, especially the Western ones.
There are few options for introducing new sanctions against the Russian Federation.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to be sharply weakened against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative soon, both Russian indices and the position of the national currency may be adjusted.
Orenburg Airlines will sue Perfect Tour.
The Orenburg Airlines sued Ideal Tour for a total of 4.7 billion rubles.
These are two cases that will be held in October.
There will be different judges.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on 14 August.
Its sum is just over 425 million rubles.
The meeting is scheduled for 7 October.
The second application was filed on 18 August.
Its sum is 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting is scheduled for 2 October.
According to journalists in the Russian Tourist Union, the judges of the cases have been appointed differently.
In July, the media revealed 1.5 billion rubles of Ideal Tour debt to the Orenburg Avilinii.
Victor Zükin, the airline's CEO, is talking about a sum of 1.6 billion rubles.
Aeroflot CEO Vitaly Saveliev calls an even larger sum of two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to become more interesting for new users
The Twitter microblog service changed the user registration process to more quickly involve new players in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have dropped their microblogs.
Now, new Twitter users will view a large number of service-recommended accounts at the time of registration to immediately draw up their own reading circle.
Recommendations are drawn up on the basis of the interests mentioned in the registration.
Twitter then automatically ticks to the subscription box for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to take the ticks off his/her own hand to avoid reading those he/she is not interested in.
While previously microblog users only saw the avatars of recommended users, Twitter now produces a sample of one of the blogger's popular tweets to help make an impression of a person.
This is the largest change in the Twitter account in the past three years.
Twitter has recently been actively working to upgrade the service.
This activity is primarily linked to the continuing efforts of the service to achieve a loss.
In 2014, the microblog service experienced a slowdown in user base growth and a decline in reader activity.
The company is in desperate need of more loyal consumer resources, which, once in a while, would remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.
The day of knowledge in Moscow will be soft and rainy
The first September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy throughout the day, as reported by meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow will be between 16 and 18 degrees, and in Moscow it will be between 13 and 18 degrees.
When the weather is clear, the rains will rain, and the wind of the eastern quarter will be quite weak - only 3 to 8 metres per second.
Vehicle disposal programme resumed on 1 September
As of 1 September, Russia has resumed a vehicle recycling programme.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As the head of the Minpromtorg of the Russian Federation, Denis Manturov, explained, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation through redistribution from other support lines.
The programme will cover all vehicles over six years of age.
The amount of compensation would range from 40,000 for a passenger car to 350,000 roubles for a cargo car.
A similar auto recycling programme had already been in place in Russia.
The Minister explained the main difference between the current project and the fact that it was now envisaged not only to dispose of machines to obtain a subsequent discount, but also that if the vehicle had reached the age of more than six years, it would be possible to purchase a new one with a discount when the old one was placed in a trade-in from the dealer, Interfax would transfer to Interfax.
More than 16 billion roubles were spent on the previous federal disposal programme, which ran from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
As a result, passenger car production was about 1.2 million in 2010 (this plus 101.4 per cent by 2009).
The Creator Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Keys, known for the game Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case began work on the game a few weeks ago, but it is only now widely known.
The source of inspiration for the game was events in Ferguson, where protests are now under way that began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has not yet been named, will be on how the coverage of stories affects their impact.
A hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will have to take pictures of what's happening in areas where there are clashes between the police and the population.
A hero can photograph events differently, which will affect the course of events.
If he makes the scene so that the police look like heroes and the protesters look like thugs, the police will start to treat him better and let him go where a normal person can't go.
If he covers events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a massive riot.
The points in the game will have to be scored by tweeting a hero, in which new subscribers will appear if the photographs posted there are popular.
The game has no name yet.
The date of the release and the platform on which it appears is unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how an event could change depending on how the photograph about it was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been considering the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to devote it not to protests in the United States but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the region's history.
However, when he saw the media covering events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what happened.
Nicky Keys is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about events from Keyes's own biography, is about how a bisexual teenager tries to tell his relationships to homophobic parents.
Helethei drags Ukraine into further bloodshed
In an appeal to prepare for another “ten thousand” victims, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine, Valery Geletei, has drawn the people into a bloody confrontation, as stated in a report by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
"In Moscow, of course, attention was drawn to the remarks made by the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Geletey, who stated that "the operation to free the East of Ukraine from terrorists had been completed" and the start of the "Great Domestic War" in which losses would amount to "tens of thousands".
The adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the post on his Facebook page, is a subject for the study of specialists in the non-military field," says a report by Russian diplomats.
They have difficulty believing that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of a civilized State.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "By informal channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if resistance continues, they are willing to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
He stated, however, that “the operation to liberate the east of Ukraine” had been completed.
Perez Hilton deleted all intimate images of stars and apologized
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars have been horrified.
Hackers hacked primitive passwords in iCloud (data storage) in smartphones, after which their intimate images appeared on blogger Perez Hilton's website.
Really, not for long.
Let's remind you, Hungry Games official Jennifer Lawrence has already reported the theft of photos from her cell phone, and he has confirmed that all the images that are "blue" on the Network are authentic.
Perez Hilton, the creator of the tabloid website of the same name, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her workshop colleagues for publishing their candid images, writing The Independent.
No, no one made me do that.
I haven't heard from their agents.
And now I'm going to delete the candid photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice," tweeted a blogger on Twitter.
However, all the frank photographs of the stars have already spread over the Web.
David Beckham was in a car accident hiding from the paparazzi.
David Beckham was in a motorcycle accident fleeing the paparazzi.
It happened in Los Angeles on the corner of Sunset Boulevard.
British footballer got off with a contusion and a stretch of the muscles of his right arm.
Beckham came out of a tattoo parlor where he was waiting for paparazzi.
Avoiding their pursuit on a motorcycle, he failed at the turn and fell down, writing TMZ citing sources close to the football player.
In the end, Beckham suffered a contusion, a spraining of the muscles of his right arm, and scratches.
Tony Stewart is in an accident returning to the track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track has already ended a little more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stuart crashed into the wall the second time after his right front tire broke on 172 lap, ending his performance.
Stuart brought his broken car to the garage and then went out without talking to reporters.
His team leader Chad Johnston said 14 team members were upset, but now will focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better try and a better finish for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond, and hopefully we can do better there.
Stuart first crashed into the wall earlier in the race Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required repairs to the right side of his car.
"I started today with quite a lot of hope to come to the finish," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart's car was loaded onto the tow truck, and the team assembled and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Spring Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during a race on a dirt road in northern New York State.
He decided to come back this week, and he needed to win either in Atlanta, or at the next race in Richmond to take part in the pursuit.
He returned to work during an investigation into a tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went on the track to express his dissatisfaction with Stuart during the race.
Law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue to be investigated for at least two more weeks.
It was not decided whether Stuart would be charged.
The three-time champion was greeted with loud cries and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starting with 12th position, Stewart walked in the first 10 at the beginning of the race, reaching fourth position.
Then on lap 122 after the reinstatement, Bush's number.
Car 18 fell off the trajectory at the exit of turn 2 and crashed into Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart continued, but fell to 21st position.
Sobchak and Vitorgan have breakfast with Zwanecki in Odessa
Xenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the broadcaster did not hesitate to report in her Instagram.
True, one photograph was very surprising and embarrassed the couple's fans.
It's taken from Zwanetski.
"At breakfast at Mikhail Mikhalyc Zhanetski Maxim explains what Instagram is:) #dessa," signed a picture of Xenia Sobchak.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no buns, no butter, no...
The couple's fans decided Xusha was smoking, too, and convicted her for it.
"And whose cigarettes?", "Curry kills!", "Some cigarette breakfast" , "Like at breakfast and only cigarettes on the table"), "Ksenia, are you smoking?" were worried about their favorite blog subscribers.
Let's remind you, Sobchak recently bragged about what a delicious dinner was made for her for the first time in her life by Maxim Vitorgan.
"Happiness is when you come to the house, and your husband has prepared dinner by your arrival (first for marriage, but what a delicious life. Most important, so that he doesn't say anecdotal words at the end of the dinner, "to make it happen every day now," boasted her husband Xenia Sobchak.
The picture shows Maxim cooking with diligence, and the table already has salts and baked chicken.
Bulgarian prison officials held a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria held a national protest before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia, the capital.
During a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of the old working conditions that had recently been changed.
Wage increases are also on the list of requirements to be discussed with Christo Ivanov, Acting Minister of Justice.
During the month, officers expressed symbolic protest against the new schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the prison staff union had met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, no agreement had been reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations are ongoing, and the BNR has been informed by Rosen Jeliazkov, head of the Directorate-General for the Enforcement of Sentences.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of the Interior are expected to join the protest of the prison service union.
The Army controls Thailand's new government
General Prayt (right) appointed Edith Wongsuwan (left) as Minister of Defence
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prayat Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of the new Cabinet, in which more than one third of the posts are held by generals or retired generals.
Representatives of the army have received key positions: Ministers of Defence, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Prait Chan-Ocha was officially confirmed as Prime Minister after the King of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to that post.
The 60-year-old military who took power in the country as a result of the bloodless coup of 22 May was the only candidate for the Premier post.
He was elected Prime Minister at a parliamentary meeting.
The army had previously appointed MPs.
According to Praia Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
He was preceded by six months of demonstrations during which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat's Government.
Officially, Pravat Chan-Ocha will be temporary premier, as the military plans to hold general elections in late 2015.
However, there are concerns that the military is trying to strengthen its authority in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
Against the backdrop of a complete paralysis of the civilian power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Jinglyk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army removed Brother Jinglyuk Chinawat Thaksin from his position as Prime Minister.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern part of the country, which has ensured their success in the elections on many occasions.
However, many middle class and metropolitan elites have joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralysed the country since November 2013.
No one said the mussel salad would be better, I didn't promise you that, the waitress from Palm's new brassier is kicking her ass.
It has to be formally admitted that this is indeed true, but the mind and stomach remain steadfast.
Because everyone's known for a long time that we say "Belgium" -- we mean mussels, we say "Midia" -- we mean "Belgium."
Restaurants like to state in depth that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location, and once again location.
There's places like this that aren't so good, they're so good, they're so bad.
Anyway, when I sat at Palm's table, I remembered that there was once a Café of Grodoch (in honor of that television show), then Odessa Mama, and a restaurant of Bojole and a beer friend.
Now it's beer again, but it's not nostalgic-Soviet anymore, it's Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg was placed above the ground: a bar and a couple of tables, all the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But it's fun here, like in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows, TVs where girl Russians swim.
Belgian institutions in Petersburg are no longer new, so there's something to compare to.
There are eight types of spill beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 litres) and countless bottles (170-1550 rubles).
A positive company waitress presents the menu in a fun way, telling us that "mydia are full big seeds," and it should be noted that it is service, despite some shortcomings, that is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Well, for example, someone's been given to predict that the vallon pruning meat loaf (280 rubles) is actually carpaccio cut so thinly that parchment paper compared to it would appear uglyly thick.
The only way you can feel any taste is if you're half-dreaming.
It's worse with salads.
The classic League (260) would be the most appropriate to recognize as a crime against the Belgian people: some dim iceberg once cooked a long time ago by a potato, sour Kenyan beans, treeed bacon chips plus some marinated onions.
You don't want to meet anyone with a leogian salad like that!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was not positive either.
If it was still possible to close your eyes to the under-aged mints of worm tomatoes or overcooked shampignons, why do the mussels look like they've been defrosted and welded several times in their lives?
I already know there are perfectly normal white-sea mussels here!
They are served in pots "in sauce for your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
The sous are half a dozen, the one with white wine, celery, and carrots, didn't really hit it.
There are vegetables, and there is no scent, and whether there was wine, it was a mystery.
But they're good for middies with homemade mayonnaise.
The chicken water here is not grinding, thick to the point that depending on the mood, you can decide whether the first or the second dish is in front of you, but just a nice cream soup.
It was stated that the rabbit was made by a local cook in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemarine.
On the test, the situation was diametrically opposite: rosemarine silenced everything.
It appeared that this rabbit was exclusively fed with rosemary bushes in his lifetime, which gave the meat such an extraordinary fragrance.
But then the rabbit's leg was accompanied by a wonderful -- no, just a great pear in a caramelized crust.
The waffles in Palm offer not only sweet but also full - with beef, chicken, or bacon, and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was too watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table was very informally interested in the lunch impressions.
Then we should come again.
The dollar went up on MMB over 37 rubles on news of new sanctions being prepared by the West against Russia.
It's a new historical record.
The dollar of tomorrow's calculations rose by 26.9 kreeks by 10:29 msk to 37.02 rubles, and the euro's rate rose by 30.73 kreeks to 48.73 rubles, as shown by the Moscow Exchange.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Prior to the Crimean events, the dollar peaked on February 19, 2009, at a cost of 36.43 roubles, and on March 3, 2014, it was already 37.005.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The ruble's weakening is long-term, both with the euro and with the dollar.
The long-term forecast suggested this mark,” says Alpari's senior analyst Anna Bodrov.
Anything related to Ukraine will be reflected in the course in one way or another.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumours about the invasion of troops have not been confirmed on any side, but the market has proved to be very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news was erased yesterday.
The week is projected to close at these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links to the same chain.
Inflation is also projected to accelerate: current prices for autumn will increase from 5 to 10 per cent.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will soon run out, and there will be a vacuum while the networks shift to other suppliers.
"Dollar came up to the 37 rubles mark, passed it and came back, some powerful hysteric no," comments the Chief of Market Analysis "Opening Broker" Konstantin Bushuyev.
They will still see whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO will be meeting.
The ruble, he said, was sharply weakened after the tax season ended, followed by news on Ukraine, and the CD stated last week that before the end of the year it was fully moving to a floating rate and refusing any foreign exchange intervention.
Looking at the day-to-day oscillation, it was no different than the previous one during this month, and it was the 37 rubles mark that scared everyone, and the analyst continues.
And so, nothing powerful happened in terms of turnover.
An alarming time for the currency market was, I recall, when the demand for currency was increased at the end of January, as well as on the third March, when the CB shipped a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of weakening the ruble.
First of all, it's an increase in the export revenue share of the budget, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through higher import prices, says the chief analyst of UFS IC Alexey Kozlov.
Adverse aspects include the cost of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke inflationary pressures and, as a result, increase the cost of borrowing, which in turn impedes the development of the economy.
In terms of the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat mitigates the decline in stock prices expressed in rubles.
For example, the MMBI index declined by 1.67% during Thursday's bidding, and the RTAs index lost 3.27%.
This significant difference in the relative decline in indices is due to the decline of the ruble during the day of more than 1.5 per cent.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is due to a massive desire to buy currency.
Experience shows that emotions are gradually eroding, and ruble quotations partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We believe we will soon be able to see the ratio of dollar to Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," notes Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
Britain reported that she had spent many years thinking she was going to die after having been misdiagnosed.
Karen Rogers spent most of his teenage age thinking she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charco-Marie-Tout's disease (SMT), a group of hereditary disorders that result in nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
CMT UK's charity reported that misdiagnosis is a frequent problem among people with SMTs because so little is known about this condition.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are believed to have a CMT that can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, insecure walking, and strained toes.
Patients may feel numbness or pain, and the condition is not cured and progressing, meaning that symptoms increase over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich's (AF) attack, a condition for which the prognosis was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be chained to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and die before she was 30.
The mother of the two children now 51 said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do what others did.
I fell every day, and it took me longer.
I could never skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied a lot at school because of the way I went and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the Ahill tendon and straighten her feet, she looked into the medical records when her doctor left the room, and it said she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose where I shouldn't, and that's why I didn't tell anyone, but I came home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked and had the worst panic possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I'd gradually lose all my powers in this time.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she had realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought and had asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you have something much less life-threatening.
After several genetic tests, she was found to have a CMT.
"When he explained what a CMT was, I thought I pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
The UK SMT Charitable Organization announced a month of information about the SMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on Washington zone entrepreneurs increases as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales, and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country increased moderately last year when economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and a company in the Washington Zone is no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia paid $27.6 billion together to the state and local treasury in fiscal year 2013, 3.8 per cent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local businesses increased by 4.3 per cent last year, to $671 billion, from 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after successive years when accounts declined, in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study conducted by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young, and the State Tax Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 per cent, comes from entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax revenue comes from firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, has the lowest tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a return to the old value of companies' real estate, researchers say, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 per cent.
While large states such as California, New York, and Texas account for a large proportion of these revenues, the same seems to be happening in the Washington Zone.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia paid $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, a 4.2 per cent increase over the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate does not have any similar effect on the increase in state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one fifth of companies' tax accounts.
Virginia and D.C. companies pay about half of state and local tax bills in the form of real estate taxes.
"What happens in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially the tax base around Columbia County, is owned either by the government or by a non-profit organization that does not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Tax Center.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more on, for example, income taxes to pay for the same services as in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully attributed to the re-establishment of the real estate market.
The income of entrepreneurs also seems to be on the right track, according to these data.
Companies in the region declared a $2.3 billion state-level corporate income tax, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income tax revenue, the largest in the region.
While trends are in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three locations.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was the same as the national average of 4.3 per cent, while the growth rate in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below an average of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate) at 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, compared with a relatively high rate of 9.975 per cent in the county.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia lower taxes for state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favourable climate for taxes for entrepreneurs than Maryland.
The county was not assessed in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from her neighbour from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed legislation reducing the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 per cent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its tax revenue targets next year, this law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs even to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington Zone seem to feel better and thus pay more state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
Taxes on entrepreneurs paid in the form of an individual income tax by small business owners - a transition structure that accommodates most small firms - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, at a much higher rate of growth than taxes for entrepreneurs in general.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business tax revenue across the country is likely to continue this year, with turnover tax revenues in state and local governments increasing by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may lag behind, as lower federal spending affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The Judo World Home Championship brought the Russian team two silver and seven bronze awards.
The Russians have been relegated to Japan as the main favorite of the competition.
The Chelyabinsk tournament started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
It was owned by Beslan Mudranov, who was in the 60 kg category.
However, in an equal final fight against Baldbaatar Ganbat of Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation resolved only one comment received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for Russia, with three medals won on Tuesday.
In men's competitions in categories up to 66 kg of silver, Mihail Pulyayev and bronze to Kamal Khan Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian gave way to the 2011 and 2013 World Champion to the Japanese Masashi Ebinume.
Khan Magomedov, who at the quarter-final stage lost to his compatriot, won a comforting tournament and became a bronze award holder.
In the women's 52 kg tournament, Natalia Cusutin also reached the third step of the pedestal of honor.
In the semi-finals, she lost to the incumbent world champion Mylinde Kelmendi of Kosovo, who competed under the flag of the International Judo Federation at the championship and successfully defended the title.
In the argument for the Cusutina bronze, she won from Ma Inan of China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place was not what she had hoped for.
Again, Kelmendi, who had defeated Cusutina earlier in the European Championship final, was a barrier to Russian gold.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, the bronze was put into the Russian team's hoard by Musa Moushkov, who fought in categories of up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinals, his abuser was former Moldavia representative Victor Skovortsov, who now plays for the UAE team.
However, the Russian won two contractions and became the winner of the award.
Moushkov competed at the home championship with a shankop injury he plans to heal soon, so he will pause in the competition.
As for the ex-moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, his other compatriot, who had adopted UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko with bronze, completed his performance in the category of up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the FM-2014 also brought to the Russians one bronze, which was won by Ivan Nifontov in a category of up to 81 kg.
In a heavy battle of the small final, he defeated Frenchman Alan Schmitt with a comment from the opponent.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at the tournament, but Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
It was possessed by Cyril Quesov, with Russia's team guaranteed the medal: his competitor for the comforting final was Kirill Denisov's compatriot.
However, the fight itself did not take place: Qov's rival was unable to get out on the tats due to the injury.
The men's bronze was conquered by the owners and on the sixth day of the competition, she was put in the money of the team by Renat Saidov, who was in the category of over 100 kg.
In a comforting final, he won a pure victory over Brazilian David Moura.
So ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian teams, male and female, were among the main applicants for the awards, but, like in individual competitions, the women of the beautiful sex were not lucky enough to reach the medal.
But the Russian Judoists won the team's silver.
In a decisive standoff, they gave way to Japan's main favorites, the team, in a relentless fight against the score of 2-3.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after the net victory of Khan Magomedov and volleyna - Denis Jartsev (weighting up to 73 kg).
However, in heavier weight categories, Murat Habachirov (81), Mohammed Mohammed (90) and Aslan Kambiyev (100) were unable to cope with their Japanese rivals.
In the same scenario, a bronze match also developed in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, driving 2-0, gave way to the Japanese - 2-3.
The team competition in Chelyabinsk was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who congratulated the men's silver team after the tournament.
"The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could be champions," said Putin, whose words RIA brings "News."
To lose to the Japanese, the Judo family leaders, there's nothing embarrassing about it.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
Russia's team at the World Home Championships was much better than a year ago at a competition of this level held in Rio de Janeiro.
Then there were only three medals in the Russian team's asset, one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansour Isaev.
We're all big maximalists, of course.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is one of the eight strongest, he's a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in a sport such as Judo," Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko summarized the tournament, the words of which are quoted by the championship press service.
Japan's team is expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various merits, five of which proved gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.

Joan Rivers' family is hoping for the best.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed her hope today that an 81-year-old comedy actress would recover from illness.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an urgent call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources report.
The doctors deliberately keep her under anesthetic and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "heavy."
The response was broad, including strong Internet support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Rip.
Everyone can be kings.
In the sale of the band's debut album Royal Blood, a new hope of British rock that brought rock duets out of clubs directly to stadiums.
The duo Royal Blood has only been on stage for a year, but already has an active BBC music award nomination, an Arctic Monkeys opening tour, and a visit to the New York concert dressing room from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name received 100,000 pre-releases a few months before release, and the contract for its release lies in Warner Music's major label portfolio.
Given the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is out of line, as it is not about the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet-haired representative of the "new R'n'B" but about the duo of bullish-looking British who play with the level of volume and intensity that was last in fashion a few decades ago.
In general, the stakes for the first album due to all the above-mentioned circumstances were particularly high and have already been met.
For good reason, the duo took a name that could have been attacked before except for the desperate hairy metalwriters, and the blood of which kings seem to be leaking in their veins, too, is understandable.
This, of course, is primarily about the past-level heroes of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aims to shake the long-standing blood of British rock by bringing it to a new height.
It may be too early to predict the success of this venture, but something can already be confirmed.
A dozen songs laid in thirty minutes are not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composer's gift as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterised by what is remembered not by the melodic line, but by the drum party.
Musicians are jokingly saying that this song is easier to knock than singing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and closing record composition of "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a party of heavy rock lovers, but when played in a row, they merge into a more or less homogeneous painting.
And that's not necessarily a bad thing, not even the opposite.
The power of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the glory of the new Lennon and McCartney (more likely marked as Motörhead's successors), but have removed numerous rock duo from the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, is made for stadiums, in a room of less than a couple thousand people, it is obvious that it is close.
The secret is partly in the cunning use of bass replacing the guitar in the usual format coined at the beginning of The White Stripes zero.
However, it's not just about the instruments, it's about the way songs are composed.
Heroics of the zero retrorocke with great difficulty were chosen beyond the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance to recognize themselves not just as epigons, but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood is already sounding so powerful and brazen that it successfully drapes some repetition and hardness of music material.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twich for $1.04 billion
AMAZON has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: Online store - and video producer, and hundreds of other things - buys a $1.04 billion Twitch streaming video production service (US$970 million).
This news was not a surprise because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch video service Google for a good billion looked completely ready, and such a combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a streaming service of a general nature - the YouTube version in real time.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; "YouTube for real-time games", according to Business Insider.
The interface Twitch.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which all-Knowers give (mostly old) games processing, like in The Mystery Theatre, are already popular on YouTube.
The point is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met with no particular interest, a classic example of a well-established technology company buying out a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that he was reportedly willing to pay just as much as Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from the CEO of Twich Emmett Shear, "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another mystery, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobam like me, who claim to be better at sports than watching it, is hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking the joystick in their own hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. when it crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a stranger get 20 shots to the head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them without controlling the angle of view on their own can be a recipe for headaches worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the rapid passages in which the Rogers of our electronic age complete whole games in record time are entertained.
But if it's not about the virtuoso of the game or humor, it's unlikely that his Twich channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and this is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon make a living on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twich would wind up in Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could just absorb Twich.
However, Twitch has something that any company would like to have: crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As the head of Twich Shire said, Amazon and Twich "both believe in the future of the games", and this channel does not give signs of wilting, even - ow - as a spectacular sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, were killed in the 2004 attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to the survivors of the hostages - almost all of them now - students, with the parents of the deceased, the graveyard keeper - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the “Beslan's Mothers” committee of Susana Dudieva, who participated in the special operation by a staff member of the MES, - says Elizabeth Antonov, a correspondent of the Society department, who worked on the special project.
Having already returned to Moscow, met Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was the President's adviser on the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with Russian FSB's "B" command officer Vyacheslav Bocharov".
What really shocked me about the time I was working on this subject was that it was like it wasn't in Beslan for ten years.
This subject is extremely painful to anyone who has anything to do with it, and people have difficulty agreeing to talk about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very difficult.
But Beslan cannot be forgotten, and I hope we've done our job," Antonova said.
A special project has been prepared by the infographic studio of Rambler & Co, which has been working with the company since spring this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to World War I and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's reign.
Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea launched a short-range missile
North Korea launched a short-range missile into the Japanese Sea, reports Renhap.
The launch took place around 10.30 a.m. local time from Chagando Province, on the North Korea-China border.
The missile is believed to have fallen into the Japanese Sea, flying some 220 km, and declared before the Joint Committee of South Korean Chiefs of Staff.
Deputies suggested speeding up the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative succeeds, Russians will not be able to store data on servers abroad as of 1 January 2015
A bill has been introduced in the State Duma to extend the date of entry into force of the already adopted Act on Personal Data of Russians, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is located in the lower house legislative framework.
It was sponsored by members of the State Duma, Vadim Mánn, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov (Single Russia), Vladimir Parahin (Just Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
Such a change would, in the view of the proponents, help to ensure the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to protect personal data and to maintain the confidentiality of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks more quickly and effectively.
The Act, the entry into force of which is rushed by parliamentarians, requires Russians to keep their personal data on the territory of the Russian Federation processed via the Internet.
It also requires the recording, systematization, stockpiling, storage, refining and retrieval of the personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located on Russian territory, as well as the indication of the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roscomnadzor the right to restrict access to information treated in violation of Russian personal data legislation by a court decision.
The Act also proposes the creation of so-called “blacklists” of violators' websites, an automated information system called “The Register of violators of the rights of personal data subjects”.
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The draft law was sponsored by Andrei Lugova and Vadim Dewyn of LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko of CRCF.
Moneyn and Yushchenko are also co-authors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who don't have a date center in the Russian Federation will have to pay rent.
Commenting on the bill introduced today in the State Duma, the first head of the Duma Information Policy Committee, Leonid Levine, stated that he saw no problem in relocating the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
According to him, those companies that by 1 January 2015 would not have their own personal data storage facilities for Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation would be able to lease them, for example, to the Rostelcom, which has repeatedly said that they are willing to lease their servers and already provide their servers, from the Mail Group, to Western companies that are already providing their servers today.
"In addition, there are several independent data centres ready to cooperate in this field," he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problem - they will have technological accommodation," Levin summarized.
Controversial Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association feared that if the bill was adopted, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
These include online airline booking and hotel services.
In the opinion of the association, “the draft law deprives the subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation - of the right to dispose of their own data by making it imperative that their recording, systematization, etc. should be ensured only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to establish a mechanism to inform the user of where the recording is done and to systematize its personal data.
In such a case, it will be possible to choose the territory in which the acts will be carried out.
The adoption of similar bills on the “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the departure of global services and significant economic losses.

Militias handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The Army of Novorossia claims to have shot down Ukrainian Su-27 and accused the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
As of 10 a.m. on 1 September, the militia had handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by a spokesperson for the Army of Novorassia.
He added that “by air defence forces in the Mereška locality, a Su-27 aircraft that violated ceasefire agreements was shot down”.
According to an agency interviewee, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions in the shelling of Lugan airport.
The spokesperson noted that the militia had managed to damage two Ukrainian air force helicopters at a field airfield during the night, as well as to destroy two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
"The enemy's casualties - up to 100 people killed and wounded, surrendered 13 men," summarized by the staff representative.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the “people's republics” Donbass declared the transfer to the Ukrainian side, within the framework of the ceasefire regime, of 223 captured soldiers and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, the DNR army, according to the Army of Novorassia, "prevented the attempt by the National Guards, in violation of previous agreements to remove heavy equipment from the surrounding area."
At that time, the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers in a short battle.
According to the headquarters, the total casualties of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) during that night amounted to five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, and more than 120 people killed and injured.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers were surrounded by militias in the Iloweisk area of Donetsk Oblast.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leaders of the “people's republics” to release Ukrainian soldiers from their midst.
In the DNR, they agreed to do so subject to the surrender of arms and ammunition by the enemy.
The first dozens of soldiers began leaving the surrounding localities on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion "Donbass" Semen Semenchenko, 14 others left the "cotla" on Sunday night.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity from 137 regiment 32 of the Russian Federation division and 9 of the Russian tank brigade", where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence of Russia denied reports by Ukrainian military and NATO of the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation: Russia will respond to new sanctions imposed by the EU
Russia reserves the right to take remedial measures to protect its legitimate interests in the event of the imposition of new anti-Russian sanctions, as reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.
A report by the Russian Foreign Service stated that the European Council's “conclusions” of 30 August had demonstrated the failure of EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their indiscriminate support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine on the basis of “absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of that country”, says the agency's website.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation regrets that the Euro-Council, contrary to the interests of its member States, is influenced by countries that are interested in increasing confrontation with Russia.
The members of the Euro-Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as for the conditions for a full-fledged “dialogue between the warring parties”, stresses the agency.
The agency's website also notes that there are currently no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbas, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has taken place, as well as an increasing number of civilian casualties.
It will be recalled that within the next seven days in the European Union, concrete proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation are planned.
In doing so, EU representatives work closely with United States officials.
They are expected to correlate between the measures introduced over the period of operation and the degree of severity.
New EU sanctions may affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and oil and gas.
Smart ways to save on university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon be in second grade, has come up with a clever way to reduce costs.
He developed a system of renting books from high school students, offering them nominal compensation to delay their sale.
"My math analysis textbook, which usually costs $180, I got a $10 semester and a "Chick-fil-A" cookie," says Schroeder, 19 years old, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The needed literature for last semester would be $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and teaching supplies, but students have a range of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing Internet stores and creative ideas like Schroeder's system.
Book rental is increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book for a semester, and often costs much less than buying it.
Nibo Incorporated, a company owned by over 250 university bookshops, reports that book rental has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented during the last spring semester, says Vice President Trevor Meyer of Nibo.
Less than half of all books are purchased at university bookshops, according to the professional association “National Association of University Stores”.
Here's an introduction to the best way to make a good deal.
Buying from an Internet store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one third of what you see at a university book store.
The ninth edition of Mathematical Analysis by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is worth about $290 on the price list, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of used equipment
If you don't mind the marks or the injuries, used textbooks are a good option.
Mathematical analysis is sold for $93.49 second-hand at Chegg.com.
Matt Cassaday, 25, fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents for a second-hand copy of the textbook "Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding the Business Side of the Advertising Business".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Bracie, director of College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, invite students to check with their professors whether previous editions can be used.
Sometimes updates are not significant for classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found at a very small percentage of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon's websites, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Rent
You might want to think about renting textbooks, if you treat them well enough, you won't forget to return them, and you won't want to keep them after the course's over.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of the new book.
For example, one student was able to hire Mathematical Analysis for a semester of about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines that you may be fined for notes, underlining, and damage.
If you hire a book, remember: if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of the new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books themselves hire, acquiring an electronic license for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The rental of Mathematical Analysis on Chegg.com will cost about $61 for six months.
Bracie says that students studying literature can often find the most advantageous prices, as many classical works can now be downloaded free of charge, while literature in natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Galt, 29 years old, who is about to start his studies at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to determine book prices, as this ensures that you are looking for the exact text you need.
Before ordering online, Galt says, make sure you check if the book is actually in the warehouse.
He had a hard time getting that lesson.
The delivery of the book he purchased was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin declared the Far East Development Fund to be totally ineffective
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the dominance of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the Far East Development Budget Investment Fund, created two years ago, is ineffective, reports Interfax.
"15 billion rubles remained on deposit," the president stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State instructed the acceleration of the approval of the list of the advanced territories in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of thores should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, noted the President, had never approved the list of the advanced territories in the Far East before 1 July, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin has also formulated the main challenges for the development of the Far East.
These include improving the region ' s transport accessibility, removing infrastructure constraints, both in the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, there is a need to create prerequisites for attracting additional investment to the region, as well as to create areas of advanced development that should become competitive with key ATP business centres, as emphasized by the President.
As will be recalled, it has been previously reported that the area ahead of development can replace the EEA.
Why the Galactica Guards couldn't save the cashier's fee
Sylvester Stallone's unstoppable 3 returned less than $30 million from his $90 million budget to the United States, while "City of Sins: A Woman Worth Killing" returned only $12 million from its $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz's home video brought only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's films such as "How to tame Dragon 2" are also disappointed by revenue.
The Telegraph article by Robbie Colleen indicates that when it comes to children's films, it may be about the poor quality of the films themselves.
Colleen called 2014 the "worst" year in the history of children's films, and called "How to tame Dragon 2" barely "functioning" by the fantasy extension.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily as films themselves.
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of each film that was released in summer with at least 2,000 copies between the May and 20 July Memorial Day celebration, for 2013 and this year.
Results that take into account the views of both film viewers and film critics suggest that the production of this year's films is similar in size to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that it can be about changing audience habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services such as Netflix.
Directed by John Favro, who is currently working on the soon-to-be-received Disney film "The Book of the Jungle" told Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We must admit it and not try to chase what happened before.
Unlike the current drop in cashier fees in Hollywood, Netflix's income from streaming services reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book franchises, and predicted Hollywood's "crews."
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators claim that his dark predictions included a share of truth.
As several potential cash hits are expected to be released in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Air Altron, Minions and Jurassic Park, other film industry representatives are more optimistic.
Produced by People X, Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in cash collections simply "cycling," saying Hollywood Reporter, "The next summer will be the most cashier summer in history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions do not frighten owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants in European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
In general, the general public has so far chosen to replace prohibited imports with products from Latin America, Israel and China rather than Russia.
"Better is a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella," the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio laments about the quality of the cheeses offered to him by suppliers instead of Italians.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ran out first in the restaurant, with a short shelf life.
Parmesan should be available for a couple more months.
What do we do?
Switch to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Roadway Market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear: shocking memories do not release him until now.
The meat there was only 30 centimeters from the floor on the carts!
There's cats in there!
Rats!
That's when I said we'd never buy anything in Russian markets for our restaurant.
I don't know, maybe it's changed now.
But the other day, I was brought to a test of fish from the Far East.
That's how it turned out to be dead!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man who brought this to us.
Valerio is surprised that many of Italy's usual things for a Russian manufacturer are savage.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is suspended in the refrigeration chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to hang to be soft enough to relax the muscles.
I did all this with local beef.
Then they asked me, where did you get that tender meat?
I told you, it's yours, Russians!
Why don't you guys do that?
Five minutes walk from Barlotti at the French restaurant Brasserie Bridge in the kitchen hangs a stop list showing missing products: French oysters, sea hedgehogs.
The chef of the Brasserie Bridge restaurant and the Stroke bar, Director Trigel, is not as pessimistic as Valerio: the oysters from France have already replaced the oysters from Tunisia, and instead of the French cheeses, the restaurant will purchase Swiss.
However, Régis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "The flower cabbage is 200 rubles!
I said, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make some money, too."
But this cabbage shouldn't cost more than 80 rubles!
Far east oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15 to 20 years, you know how much their shell weighs?
At cost, it's superdelicates.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of horrors for foreign cooks.
Standard story: "The first three months were good, then quality dropped sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many restaurants in the European kitchen don't know what's gonna happen to them when they run out of cheese.

Can not open message
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure Russia's security, which are mostly called product sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pork, meat and co-products from poultry, meat delicates, fish, molluscs, milk, yoghurts, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups into the country.
The restaurants have begun to have a chehard with suppliers: food prices have risen, and there is an urgent need to look for analogues from other countries.
This will have the greatest impact on expensive restaurants with monocubes in France, Italy, Spain, to which products were delivered directly from the “mother” countries.
The community has had to remodel before.
For example, when Rosselhoszor banned Australian beef in early 2014, and American and Canadian meat a year earlier.
In return, suppliers have established beef deliveries from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But summer-2014 sanctions have been much more severe.
True, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban the boys of Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for planting.
Italian Valerio hopes that the sanctions may be further relaxed.
In the meantime, some restaurants exist under conditions of uncertainty.
According to East West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70 per cent.
"Dear restaurants will have to change menus to what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergei Mironov, the restaurant owner of the RestConsult agency.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few of these chefs, and it could take two or three months to develop a new menu.
The trigel from the Brasserie Bridge restaurant is ready for this: you're gonna have to give up 10-15% of the food, you're gonna have to recycle half the menu.
Restaurants with mixed kitchens are already starting to replace foods, such as marble beef steak - with beefstrogans, says Sergei Mironov.
"The cheeses from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile" lists the representative of East-West Oxana Glibchuk.
Cream and dairy products from Europe are similar in Russia and Belarus.
The chicken from the United States can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and semga from Norway - salmon, seed, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of European-made vegetables and fruits can be offset by domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, it would be easier for budget network restaurants to restructure than the bonus segment: there were hardly gourmets that could distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian.
Although it would be difficult for Ginza Project institutions, he believed.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with its menu.
It's gonna take a lot of time to replace," says the Mirons.
In Ginza, comments were refused, citing the lack of owners in the country.
The owners of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from former Soviet republics smell better than Europeans.
But there are many restaurants that will not be affected by sanctions.
These include institutions with cuisine in CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive foods in Georgian cuisine," says Khatuna Kolbay, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe "Wai Mae!".
All cheeses are made for us in Russia, and we don't use exotic green at the base of many dishes.
In Kolbai's establishments, not a single dish has been removed from the menu.
Timur of Lan, owner of Chaihon's N1 restaurants with Uzbek cuisine, is also not embarrassed: he will only have to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia gets imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan, we'll even win the price, it'll be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
From the CIS, it is cheaper to get clippings, lambs, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
However, what comes from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About Uzbek tomatoes, everyone knows they're delicious, sweet.
No one says that about Spanish.
Following the imposition of the sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, Olymboy Artykov, stated that he planned to double the export of fruit products to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports into Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
The fast food restaurants who responded to the money request also respond fairly calmly to sanctions.
McDonald's Press Service stated that localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of Subway Russia's supplier department, about 80 per cent of products are purchased in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties in supplying vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In Theremka, “sanctioned products” accounted for no more than 4% of the total.
They didn't touch the sanctions, nor did they touch the Vocker noodles.
KFC, Burger King, and Little Potato did not respond to the Money request, but other market participants argue that Burger King's localization is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, Restaurants are willing to buy more Chilean than Russian Far East
On your hunchback.
Meanwhile, restaurants complain that even local food prices are rising due to increased demand.
"Grabley's food prices increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio doubled," says the rector Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will grow by 5-10 per cent, recognizing Kolbaya.
East West doesn't deny it: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have been 10-15% high since the beginning of August."
"Brazilian suppliers raised pork prices almost double," complains Sergei Rak, Deputy CEO of Stardogs.
The ham was 35 per cent higher than the chicken leg.
We expect prices from China, maybe they'll cool off the hot Brazilian heads.
Stardogs will soon have a planned price increase of 8%.
It's too bad to raise prices right now, says Cancer.
According to statistics, the increase in general consumption income during the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is not clear how fast: while most of the restaurants have stored the products for the next two months in the hope of waiting for price swings.
But what happens in two months, nobody knows.
In front of Moscow City Hall stands a dozen tents decorated with green and wood.
In the middle of the scene, musicians play waltz.
It's a festival of regional products with the fun name "There's Time."
"We've been going to make a local food festival for a long time, and here's the sanctions, we've rushed, we've organized a festival," says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with the musicians, Greek cook Anastas prepares salads of pasta and homemade candy, and there was a master-class preparation of the bourgeois with caramelized apples the other day.
All of Russia's foods are assured by the organizers.
In the tents is an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian people's economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, deer from Salehard, vegetables from the moored Lenin Sovhoza, cheeses from Italian Jay Clouse.
"The salmon for restaurants can be safely replaced by another salmon fish from the Far East," says the owner of the fish shop, "My people," Philip Galkin.
We've got Nerques, ketoo, kizhucha, humpback, chavicha - "Royal salmon."
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon because they're wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take it in your hand, it doesn't even move.
And you can't hold our far-eastern salmons in your hands.
Only establishments without special claims agree to replace the Italian mozzarella with a domestic one.
In the window of his tent are shrimps with a Magadan tag, cod, omul, floursun, misdies from Crimea, scallops from the Far East.
Galkin is sure it's long overdue to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, fish catches in Russia in 2013 were more than 4 million tons, and a large proportion of fish went to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 are about 800,000 tons.
My people's shop has been working since 2012, selling fish through an Internet store, serving a dozen and a half restaurants, such as Simple Things, before the sanctions were imposed.
Galkin has now received requests from another 15 restaurants.
The same sushi can be made of our fish, it's hot.
We got tired, we tried all kinds of recipes.
We're selling sushi through an Internet store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is a few times cheaper, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In support of Galkin's tent, I'm being prepared for a philadelphia with a ket.
Unlike the rolls with the seed, they have to chew longer, but the realization that this fish is our domestic gives strength.
There's even halibut and sea bass rolls on the website of the "Seamen" store.
In sushi bars, however, replacing Norwegian salmon is preferred to Chilean.
Galkin explains this by the fact that cooks are lazy to come up with new recipes with far-east fish.
"Russian fish suppliers haven't offered us yet," explains Killfish Bar owner Dmitri Evesev.
The situation is similar to that of other products: Russian producers could have occupied the vacated niche, but this is not the case.
According to LavkaLavka's founder and co-owner Boris Akimov, it is now more likely to replace imports from Europe and America by imports from China, Israel, and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly replace prohibited imports as opposed to our farmers.
So the ban will primarily benefit large producers of other countries," says the Akims.
In the last month, however, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal than the food sanctions.
As a result of the massive unscheduled inspections of Rospornadzor, three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the nature of the claims made to determine the actions needed to open restaurants for visitors as soon as possible," said "Money" at McDonald's Press Service.
No one really understands what's going to happen next.
If everything is limited to product sanctions, it is one option that can survive, says an anonymous employee of a restaurant consulting company.
If they start shutting down McDonald's all over the country, the script will be quite different.
Europrotocol instead of the HBDD reference
Casco payments will be available without HBDD's knowledge, so the CB intends to stimulate the introduction of Europrotocol in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has drawn up draft instructions that, as of 1 September this year, an insured motorist will be able to do without a GBDS certificate in order to receive the Casco payments.
This is true only in cases where the accident was performed by Europrotocol without the involvement of traffic police.
That is, if only two vehicles were involved in the accident, there were no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the prescribed limit, and both drivers agreed on who was responsible for the accident.
As of 2 August, the limit for Europrotocol payments is 50,000 rubles, and as of 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad oblasts, it will be raised to 400,000 rubles.
The point is that often even with minor injuries, in a situation where accidents can be handled by Europrotocol, drivers who have been in an accident cause a DBS.
After all, in the case of the policy, the Casco could not be reimbursed without the HBDD's certificate.
The parameters set out in the draft guidelines are intended to remove this obstacle to the introduction of Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum Casco payment for accidents without HBTS staff should not be lower than the Europrotocol limit.
However, it cannot exceed the limit set by the Casco insurance policy.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically able to unload both the officers and the roads.
But it is likely that neither motorists nor insurers will be thrilled with her.
The latter are already talking about the serious threat of increased fraud that might result from the introduction of new rules for Kasco payments.
As far as drivers are concerned, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
The driver will, in most cases, wait hours for the inspector to make a minor accident, because it's more reliable.
And it's still not known that it's easier to beat the fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of Europrotocol.
The savings certificate will make the name and the irrevocab.
Minfin wants to ban bearer savings certificates, but lets banks make them the equivalent of an irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban bearer savings certificates.
This tool has recently gained popularity, as the stakes here are higher than bank deposits.
The fact is that bearer savings certificates do not enter into the deposit insurance system and are cheaper for the bank because there is no need to make a contribution to the Deposit Insurance Agency (IBA).
The sharpness of the situation is that this step is planned because of the small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and will be affected by it, Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which are estimated by AAC to control 98 per cent of the market.
The share of the Bank of Moscow is estimated by the agency to be about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the AAC, is that clients of a small bank who have purchased such a certificate, if his licence is revoked, attempt to obtain money from the AAC.
Some depositors, lacking financial literacy and buying bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investments are insured.
The well-founded lack of insurance payments for these certificates in the event of the withdrawal of the bank's licence could lead to misunderstanding and social tensions.
In agency practice, there have been cases where bearers of bearer certificates have sought to recover insurance compensation through a court of law," said the AAC.
The problem is, of course, flimsy.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of the certificates, since they have no legal right to compensation from the State.
If it were that the instrument was not insured in the ASA, it would also be banned from the metal accounts in which the funds of citizens are recorded in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts are not included in the deposit insurance system either, but they are not yet attempted.
It is likely that bearer certificates are a very convenient securities that can actually act as quasi-deneg.
However, their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any bank client can buy a certificate, pass it on to any citizen, and before cashing out such a certificate can change many owners.
It is not by accident that the bill states that the savings certificate must necessarily be the name of the securities to be kept in the depositary.
And to sweeten a pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without early repayment.
That is to say, the counterpart of an irrevocable contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Nyport and Cardiff
The weekend saw protests by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff Town Hall on what was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed developments for us over the weekend and spoke to protesters who came from all over, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter the Islamic State terrorist group, reports on 31 August ITAR-TASS, referring to a decision taken following a meeting of representatives of the Government of Germany led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to have sent 30 Milan portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
The deliveries will be made before the end of September.
In addition, it has been decided to allocate an additional 50 million euros for humanitarian assistance to Iraq.
On September 1, Ms. Merkel will deliver a government statement on the subject in the Bundestag.
So far, Germany has not delivered its weapons to the hot spots.
The views of the people of the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the sending of weapons to Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop Islamic State fighters, while others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militias hit by a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
Donetsk militiamen hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reporting on 31 August ITAR-TASS.
This reportedly occurred in the Taganrog Bay near the towns of Shirokino and Unnamed (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media outlets have reported the firing of two coast guard boats.
It is clarified that the incident occurred today around 16:20 msk.
Teenagers were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
A BUShuoker couple were taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man went on a camping trip shortly after noon on Sunday at Govetts Lip in Blackhit.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8:00 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search party was sent, which included local police and a rescue team, and a couple were found around 11:00 p.m. near the Brideal Vale Falls.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell and hurt his head.
Officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were picked up on a winch Monday morning.
They were taken by an ambulance in stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two alliances met.
The high-level talks in Minsk did not resolve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian.
For the first time, the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed a number of “hot issues” on an alarming occasion (the situation around Ukraine is urgent).
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is unclear; it is clear who took the cream from this summit.
Questions about this fell off on the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, followed by other Eurasians and Europeans, saw a new President Lukashenko on television news.
The Belarusian leader has set an example of refined courtesy, it was the behavior of a man who has just torn the jackpot - and plans decent old age in a higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk of the three main European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf was not just a 20-year-old presidential legitimization.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full subject of European politics and as the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, Denis Melyantsov, is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to speak to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met the Tet-a-tet with Lukashenko suggests that relations with the EU will continue to defrost," he said, "The Fire."
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for a breakthrough by the Belarusian authorities began well before the November Maidan in Kiev, in the summer of 2013.
"The results have been achieved and with the EU - successful negotiations on visa and readmission simplification, modernization dialogues - lists Ognka's interlocutors - and international security talks have been held with the US.
The States even lifted a few sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves, and the reaction of the leaders of Belarus, have only fuelled the process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine, warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure denied Crimea's accession to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militias in Donbass with all severity, did not argue with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave the Customs Union or CSTO, and a Russian air base is located in the Baranovics.
Brussels and Washington noticed Minsk's balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated it, Belarusian experts are confident.
How successful the Lukashenko movement will be to political diversification will be by how often in the near future Minsk will be able to host EU+TC meetings.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to quickly answer questions about what Brussels expected of relations in the new format.
Spokesperson Ashton Maya Kosiančić merely said "The Fire" that, against the background of addressing issues of war and peace, the topic was not a priority.
At the same time, it was reported that Kazakhstan could be the next venue for a meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the first persons in a new format.
The drop of degt for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaev, in which he admitted that he had been personally asked by the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties were not opposed to Minsk remaining the central venue for meetings both in Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” is becoming a fully handshake European leader who helps solve the global problem.
European farmer's best friend
The very composition of the EU delegation, which included the Euro-Commissaries on Trade and Energy, led to the conclusion that the main rationale for the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbass, but the economy.
Indeed, the meeting's timetable for future negotiations on gas supplies and for overcoming the concerns of TC countries under Ukraine's association agreement with the EU seems to be more ambitious than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Carl De Güht nonetheless stated: EU representatives "came to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not the other way around."
It seems, however, that the economic crisis in Ukraine is working for Belarus as well.
Its consequences - and above all the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still experiencing sanctions pressure, a long-awaited field of manoeuvre.
According to the leader of the Mises Research Center, ex-candidate for the president of Belarus, Jaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus's ability to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation in circumvention of sanctions.
In so doing, supply schemes are being put in place, for which Vladimir Putin wrote Minsk at the summit.
"The initiators of these schemes," said Romanchuk "Ogonku," the Russian companies, not Belarusian businessmen.
They have worked for a long time on delivery schemes, including those from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and these schemes have now been destroyed.
Russian business urgently needs to rebuild them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, continued by an expert, is that many Ukrainian companies would like to produce in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with a Russian market orientation.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be very popular."
According to Romanchuk, the role of host of the EU negotiating ground and TC is ideal for Lukashenko and for developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions were estimated at Euro5-10 billion, and that the European Commission was currently offering only Euro125 million in compensation to the agrarian population.
The Belarusian president can offer Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for Euro-farmers.
This could raise Lukashenko's credibility in the EU to unprecedented heights.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for their initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that official Minsk, from its active role in the birth of the TC+EU format, is scrapped, and the Belarusian leader, in a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague, stressed that Kiev was the original initiator of the new format.
"It was your offer to come together, without going to discuss, not from the bay, to decide, after the signing of the Treaty of Association with the EU, to deal with the situation that was developing in Ukraine at the time," he appealed to Peter Poroshenko in front of the cameras.
However, the observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, it was rumored to be initially against Minsk's mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department, it is keenly emphasized that Belarus, in organizing the EU-TC interaction on its land, does not pursue selfish purposes, but that the ultimate objective of this format is to create a single economic space in the future from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“It is in the spirit of concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the security sphere, have been put forward and promoted by the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation,” said the “Fire” in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, an agency where words have recently been carefully chosen.
There may be paid entry zones in Moscow.
The Moscow government views the introduction of toll-entry zones as a method of combating congestion of central roads similar to other major cities in the world, transmitting M24.ru with reference to Moscow's deputy transport mayor Maxim Liksutov.
One option that has proved successful is a paid entry.
It's an expert opinion, we'll definitely study it, see all the negatives and the pros.
Talk about making decisions about it before it's too soon," Lixutov told me.
The Deputy Mayor stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which were similar in structure and workload to Moscow, was very important to the capital's authorities.
One solution taken from these countries is the construction already under way of the central ring road, adding Lixutov.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of not having to allow all traffic through Moscow.
If there were sufficient bypass infrastructure, there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," noted the deputy mayor.
Maxim Lixutov also stated that the introduction of fee-paying parking lots had significantly unloaded the metropolitan streets.
And, he said, the capital authorities are not planning to stop.
Let us recall that on 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital Sergei Sobyanin participated in the bookmarking ceremony for the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CKAD).
It's boring.
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez' film "City of Sins-2: A Woman Worth Killing for" made a very wrong revolution that could have been expected of him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), taken with the minimal but symbolic involvement of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between film, comic book and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental chain of modern thinking of the "thesis-antithesis-fusion" (in terms of the noir universe's thesis and the comic book's space by the antithesis).
From now on, it should read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
"City of Sins-2" is chaotic in both dramatic and philosophical terms: both times, it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first City, though, as the giant Marv (Mikki Rourke) remembers, he ended his life in an electric chair, and here, nothing but to steal - as this folk friend - from the air of the knives and other axes with the nooses.
But old people are literally pushed around with their elbows by newcomers, like they've broken into the city from some other movie, the meaning and story of which the audience is asked not to worry.
So, his own story, shamelessly torn apart by authors at the most interesting place, by super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Lewitt).
Ours is with the lustful freegid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something vindictive to her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight is, let's say, in the face of Johnny -- especially since faces, like other parts of the body, are demolished with unrelenting regularity -- is not a problem or even half a victory.
They're not humans, we understand that these are the archetypes of the noire: a rock bitch who's too confident a player who's fallen into a "med trap" of sex by a detective who's a corrupt ghouls.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and the archetype chases, it's no longer a movie, but it's an abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the story is ridiculous.
Besides, even in this troubled world, there's something permanent.
Battle whores from the first City still hold round defense against the forces of darkness enslaving their native slums.
And Detective Hartigan's ghost won't, and he'll look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem with "City of Sins-2" is another.
Frank Miller was good at putting together a comic book and a noir as a painter, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to put comic books on screen.
Comic and Noir are two aggressively opposed to reality.
The comic book phonomen in modern form was born in the late 1920s, when Dashil Hammet's novels "Blood Harvest" (1929), "Maltic Falcon" (1930), and "The Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of noire, then called hard-boiled school, a "cool school".
Or pulp fiction.
The comic books gave Hollywood dozens of heroes, from the Popay sailor, the spinach eater, giving him rich power, Superman, Batman, and the scout Dick Tracy to the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other vigilantes.
But in any comic book-based movie, there was something harmful: the painted characters were obstinately unwilling to grow the screen flesh, remained pretenders in the "real" world surrounding them.
Simply put, they were completely disenfranchised.
Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After world wars, a traditional novel - with experiences, personalities, family scandals, and historical background - has lost all credibility.
What are the Forts, what Tibo and Rugon-Makkar, what are the Bolkon and Rostov minds after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel was peacefully mutated into soap opera format, and the criminal - i.e. marginal - novel rose to the level of a philosophical prose.
Hammet learned on his skin what it's like to work as a nurse on the front.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, were at least close to the compact and pillars of the genre, such as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directed by Jules Dussen, Joseph Lowsey, Edward Dmitrick.
Therefore, the Noir whose archetype they set is, first, crude and cynical and, secondly, purely social.
It's almost an American version of socialism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural, but organically connected the comic book to the Noir.
For the first time on screen, the comic book was alive, not shy of its graphic nature, but pretended to be a "real" film.
The lot of the corrupt world where the cardinal ordered the murders and the senator covered for the monstrous sadist son was quite worthy of the pen Hammet.
And the picturesque details, such as the severed heads that sadist decorated his nest, the pen of genius James Ellroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best, i.e. declaratively nauseous Neonuar.
"City of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but a surrender of Miller's radical style--Rodriges before the comic book tradition.
It must have happened a lot because of 3D technologies.
When you watch the second "City of Sins," you feel like a prisoner in a glass ball, inside which the snow falls to a toy clown.
Most of the time, though, it's not snow, it's blood clots, but what's the big difference?
Well, there's nothing to say about socialism.
Because it's only possible when somewhere, somewhere we sometimes have, even on the side of a dirty swamp, but there's a normal world where you can bring back a girl who's gone down a crooked path or, say, tell the saddest parents that her destroyer is punished.
But when there is no place for sin in the city except for sin, it is no sin, but a norm.
Boring as any rule.
Chaos "City of Sins-2" is boring.
For the sake of justice, a domestic rental gave this fresh sin a small, but pepper.
The credits warn: The film contains harmful smoking scenes.
With respect to the spectacle, in the vegan episode itself, whose fingers are pinched, it gives hell humor.
Hammet would love it.
French socialists should "shut up and get France in order," says the key ally of Frasua Holland.
Mr. Valle called on the deeply divided left-wing forces to "show warmth" to the attacked socialist president, whose reshuffles were not approved by the overwhelming majority of the French.
The president deserves respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay close to him," he said, causing applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister has assured that his Government will not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the inflammatory proposals, it must weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain "one" with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, Minister of Justice, put sticks in the wheels, coming to a meeting of dissenting Socialist Party MPs and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lost faith in the future."
Marin le Pe, the leader of the extreme right-wing National Front, expressed contempt for the permanent internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not realize that the new Wall government would last longer than a few months.
François Hollande is a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Valle, forced to assemble a new government when the summer never lasted.
"And the new one won't last autumn or winter," said Mrs. Le Pen to reporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to govern.
The ruling French party survived the defeat in the March municipal elections, and the extreme right-wing National Front came first in the EU election in May.
A poll of Sunday's Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of the French believe the Socialist Party risks falling apart into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Holland's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist from the University of Cians Poe, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government failed to correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to feel quickly that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
"City without drugs" left no suit.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed the claim of the Managing Directorate of the Regional Ministry for the Management of Public Property to the City Free of Drugs Foundation.
The agency intended to collect more than 7 million roubles from the organization as rent for a building in central Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the Court of Arbitration of Sverdlovsk province has left undisturbed the action of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Region (MUGISO) against the City without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders is Yekaterinburg Mayor Evgeny Royzman).
The regional authorities intended to collect 7.3 million roubles from the organization as rent for the building.
Today, it was reported that the plaintiff had twice failed to appear before the court, which had led to the decision to refuse consideration.
The reason for the absence of representatives from the MIGIZ Directorate was not able to explain, and Maxim Titov, the head of the legal department, did not respond to the telephone calls.
Representatives of the foundation were also not contacted.
Let us recall that this is the mansion that occupied the foundation in downtown Belinsky Street, 19 free of charge since 2011.
Such a decision was made by ex-Governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of Public Property Management of Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court for the eviction of the foundation from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the agency required the court to declare the contract of free use of the memorial mansion unincorporated.
In the opinion of the MAGIZO Directorate, the agreement did not contain significant terms and conditions for the rental of a cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsk arbitral tribunal dismissed the claim, at which time an appeal was lodged with the 17th Permi arbitral tribunal, which was granted.
The Fund then filed an appeal against the decision with the same court, which was rejected, after which the decision was appealed by the fund to the High Court of Arbitration, but the court took the side of the administration.
In 2013, a new lease was concluded under which the fund began to pay rent again, as reported by the city's head of Evgeny Royzman.
The rental fee was set at 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous administration of the region gave us this building for free, recognizing our service in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the foundation.
The current administration decided differently," he said.
Tatiana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why was the mayor of Catherineburg asked to leave voluntarily?
On 24 July, Ekaterinburg's porous deputy Alexander Kosintsev invited the city's mayor, the speaker of the proud Evgenius Royzman, to resign.
The case was one of a criminal case against a retired woman, Oleg Kinev, who was arrested on suspicion of murdering a member of the proudness of the mayor, who was considered a partner of the mayor.
How Eugenia Royzeman was found in a criminal case
On 1 July, it was reported that criminal proceedings had been instituted in connection with the offence of defamation (article 128.1 of the Criminal Code) on the blog of Yekaterinburg Mayor Evgeny Royzman.
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs Department for Sverdlovsk province, where Anna Filatova, Director-General of the Legal Centre for Protection, made a statement.
According to her, Mr. Royzman accused her of having been involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her former husband on his blog.
The Mayor of Catherineburg is convinced that "this is another attempt at revenge for the truth."
The iPhone will be turned into a wallet.
In the run-up to 9 September, when Apple is due to present its new developments, new leaks are appearing in the press about what can be expected from the presentation.
With reference to sources, American media reports that the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint Apple project and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and Re/code's specialized Internet resource, at a presentation of new products on September 9, Apple may, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, which will make the mobile wallet function available in the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
The companies themselves refuse any comments in this regard.
This function allows payment to be made at the store's counter using a smartphone.
The user will identify the payment by his thumbprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will for the first time incorporate NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows a non-contact payment to be made using a smartphone and an appropriate reader on the cashier.
NFC technology itself will be available through a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was first introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and over a hundred other companies in the so-called NFC Forum, an association to promote this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone on Android with the NFC function of Samsung Nexus S was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced Google Wallet, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay with a smartphone on Android.
However, American experts emphasize that despite the large investment of high-tech companies in promoting NFC technology, American rhythmlers are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on equipping their stores with such systems.
Therefore, observers now hope that Apple's entry into this market will still force the rhythmlers to speed up and intensify their introduction of this technology to their outlets.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France: Paris' position on the supply of Mistral to Russia remains unchanged
The official spokesman for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Roman Nadal, stated Paris's constant position regarding the supply to Russia of helicopter carriers of the type Mistral.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Holland) in an interview with Le Monde on 20 August: "Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is a European decision, not a French decision," quotes Mr. Nadal "RIA News."
Thus, the representative of the French foreign policy agency replied to the question as to whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in Paris's position on the implementation of the contract.
For more information on the delivery of helicopter carriers to Russia, see Ogonek magazine, Mistral, almost ours.
Ukrainian National Security Council: seven military personnel have been killed in the area of the force operation in the past 24 hours
The representative of the Council of National Security and Defence of Ukraine, Andrei Lysenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the war zone in the east of the country over the past 24 hours, and 25 others had been injured.
The situation under Ilowaysk is extremely difficult.
Until the withdrawal operation is completed, details will not be disclosed.
Upon completion of the operation, data on casualties and the reasons for the situation will be made public.
The perpetrators of such a situation will be held responsible," added Mr. Lysenko, refusing to discuss the situation in more detail under Ilowaiski, where several Ukrainian battalions were surrounded.
According to the representative of SNBO, “every effort is being made to return the troops who have been captured” reports ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Lysenko also noted that the Ukrainian military withdrew from Luhansk Airport towards the town of Georgievka.

Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise operator, is in the final stage of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion marketable company, access to luxury cruise ships and secured customers Prestige Cruises, as it competes with the larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCCL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, with sources reporting on Sunday warning that negotiations might still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company of Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
Sources have asked to remain unnamed, as negotiations are not open.
Representatives of the Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Her income was $2.57 billion in 2013, a 13 per cent increase over 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which jointly own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She announced a income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than a year earlier.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of the middle class in developing economies such as China and India in the following years.
Companies racing seek to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for primary public stock placement in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's main shareholder after a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it now exists, in 2000 as a result of a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and casino under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a share of 28 per cent, Apollo owned a share of 20 per cent, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP owned a share of 8 per cent of the company, according to reports at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of cruise traffic in North America, according to registration documents at the first public posting of Prestige Cruises shares.
Crimea television and radio can receive 250 million rubles of subsidies.
In the Russian Ministry of Communications, 250 million rubles are proposed to be allocated to the State television and radio company Crimea in 2014.
As can be seen from the draft Ministry of Communications Regulation, which is posted on the unified portal for the disclosure of information on the preparation of regulations, it is planned to spend subsidies “to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of a modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea”.
The money will also be used to purchase equipment, repair the roof and power supply systems in the building of the television and radio company founded in 1959, reports to RIA News.
Hong Kong Democratic activists disrupt the Chinese representative's speech the day after the election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress of China on Sunday determined the procedure by which only two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the election of the Hong Kong leader in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of a majority of the nomination committee, which will probably be full of Beijingian loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to enter the ballot and has forced democratic activists once again to promise to stop Hong Kong's financial center with the Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of Beijing's document describing China's control over Hong Kong, in June Democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the city's business centre and staged a sit-in strike.
The briefing by Lee is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Bureau of the State Council, Feng Wei, were also scheduled to address a series of briefings during the day.
Activist students said they would gather at the Hong Kong Head of Government building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
The Israeli authorities intend to add 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities have announced their intention to add 400 hectares of land on the West Bank belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to BBC, the decision to add land to Southern Bethlehem is linked to the desire to repay the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Ministry of Defence announced the seizure on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative administration on the West Bank.
According to Gaza Strip spokesman Saib Arikat, world public opinion should hold Israel accountable for “the continued settlement activity on the West Bank and East Jerusalem”.
Putin demands Kiev to start negotiations on “Statehood” of eastern Ukraine.
According to Russian news reports of his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on “statehood” of the separated region.
His spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that the eastern Ukrainian territory under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be revised to allow the Russian-speaking region to defend its rights and interests.
Putin’s call for the Kiev government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equal, however, was in line with the obvious strategy that he had followed since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly declared territory of Novorossia de facto independence in order to draw close to Russia rather than to the West.
In an interview with the State's First Television Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the return of separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists recently called the captured territories Novorassia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future when Ukrainian politicians start campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government troops attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, a “prisoner of illusions”, ITAR-TASS reported.
"We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations and not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin's words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which was discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskov.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the Kremlin's spokesperson to correct Putin's "incorrect interpretation" of words underlined the Russian leadership's decision to behave towards the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open capture of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much heavier battle to join even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents were not Russian, and polls prior to the conflict showed widespread support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, in fact, by transferring to the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would connect Russia's main territory to Crimea.
On the Black Sea Peninsula, attached five months ago, there is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
The regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea also contain mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed, during his inaugural speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, weigh constitutional amendments allowing for more control over their finances and the status of languages to separate regions.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arming and incitement are blamed on Moscow.
Putin's last call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders, as equals, followed new rebel offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
Russian-backed separatists took control of the town of Novoazovsk in an attack about which Ukrainian security officials say they fear it is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory up to Crimea itself.
This has led to extensive civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazov and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko addressed a gathering of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which was independent for 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia to be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Iloweisk after two columns of Russian armoured vehicles and 1,000 military last week entered the Donetsk region to support the troubled separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesperson for the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, informed reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly detained in Ilowaysk as a result of the Russian invasion was traded on Sunday for 10 Russian airbornes captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, reported Lysenko on Sunday.
The nude scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greko.
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his aversion to hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée Gaby Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a number of candid photographs depicting nude Jennifer Lawrence got online as a result of a massive celebrity hacker scandal.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 candid photographs of the Star of the Hunger Games Lawrence and superstars, including Kate Upton and Kara Deleven, singer of Rianne, Ariane Grande and Leah Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahowski and Melbourne-based Greko were also allegedly stolen from iCloud leaks.
There's 101 celebrity names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs should remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is in New York City, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was "infamous" and that the people it targeted "feeling they were invaded."
The hacker is believed to have 30 photographs of Palmer with former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two footage where she lies by the nude breast pool.
Palmer's film work includes Love and Honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of "Chuck" Strakhovsky and actress from "Prohibited Reception" Browning didn't comment on stolen photos yesterday.
Representative Lawrence said to TMZ, "This is a blatant invasion of privacy."
Acter Seth Rogen expressed his outrage at the hacker by tweeting: "Putting photos stolen from a mobile phone is actually no different from selling stolen goods."
It's just, from a legal point of view, you can't tolerate publishing stolen photos.
A potential way to steal photos of nude celebrities has been discovered
Mass hacking of star accounts may be done through vulnerability in Find My Phone app.
A potential scenario of events described The Next Web resource.
The Github resource featured a script in Python, which allowed passwords to be picked up for the Find My Phone service of Apple.
This service allows you to track the iPhone's location.
An Apple ID login and password is used to access it, as is access to the Apple iCloud cloud from which celebrity photos were stolen.
The script allowed the password from Find My Phone to be over-recognized by the method.
This method consistently introduces all kinds of combinations of characters, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The script author claimed that in Find My Phone service, the number of password variants entered is unlimited.
If the security system is properly organized, after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and the user informed of the hacking attempt.
Due to vulnerability, users received no reports of an attempt to find a password for their account.
The hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to Hackapp on Twitter, vulnerability was detected two days ago, Saturday, and a password selection script was written.
To date, vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user Hackapp and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability was common to many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability had been used to access the "stars" account.
It's not me, plz RT.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister re-emerged foreign recordings
Although there is no firm evidence that vulnerability was used in Find My Phone to steal photographs, there was already a wave of malfeasance using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In the case, Apple told the media that in this case the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the tweet of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was also hacked earlier.
If the perpetrators had access to the iCloud described above, the password to the head of government account in the microblog service could be stored there.
The Next Web resource failed to obtain Apple's comments on vulnerability at Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to the Ukrainian five-story
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the well-known Ukrainian athlete Anna Burjak.
The decree has been published on the Internet portal for legal information.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia for a permanent residence and asked the Federation of the Modern Fives to allow her to compete for the Russian Federation team.
In 2013, she won two phases of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European Championships in personal championship, and became the world champion in the mixed relay, which is one of the new types of program in this sport.
She holds a leading position in the current season as well.
According to the rules, she will need special permission from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee to compete at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
Anna Burjak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her nationality.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to chess player Catherine Lagno, born of Lviv, who is a two-time champion of Europe (2005, 2008), the world's bristle (2010) and fast chess (2014).
As part of the Ukrainian women's team, the athlete became the winner of the chess olympiade in Turin (2006), the Astana World Team Championship (2013) and the Warsaw European Team Championship (2013).
SCR stopped investigating the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The Russian Investigation Committee (RCC) discontinued the criminal case for the Tu-204 plane crash of Red Wings.
This is reported by the agency's press service.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and the flight engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the disaster was caused by the increased speed of the approach to land, the crew ' s failure to comply with standard boarding procedures, and the inadvertent introduction of engines to higher speed straight-forward thrust.
The Tu-204 aircraft of Red Wings, on a Prague-Moscow flight, crashed on 29 December 2012 while landing at Vnukovo Airport in Moscow.
The aircraft rolled out behind the runway and caught fire.
The commander of the aircraft, a co-pilot and a flight engineer were killed at the scene.
Two flight attendants were taken to treatment facilities, where they subsequently died of injuries.
Three other flight attendants, hospitalized with serious injuries, were undergoing long-term treatment.
In addition, a driver of a car travelling on the Kiev Highway was seriously injured.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
The Transport Prosecutor's Office conducted an inspection at Red Wings after the disaster, which revealed numerous irregularities.
In February 2013, the airline's licence was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Yemelyanenko began training in SIZO
A prominent Russian mixed-style fighter, 33-year-old Alexander Yemelyanenko, who is in the SIZO on charges of sexual assault on a domestic worker, has fully recovered from his injuries and started training.
It's being reported by the Champion.
In May of this year, the Russian Investigation Committee charged Alexander Yemelyanenko with rape.
The suspect was wanted and detained in Tambowa on 9 May following a traffic accident that caused him to break his thigh.
Yemelianenko, Jr., was arrested until 31 August, and sentencing was scheduled for 1 September.
However, the trial was postponed and the investigation insisted on extending the period of detention until 30 September.
If proven guilty, the athlete is liable to imprisonment for up to six years.
What's the strength, brother?
Lenta.ru recalls the most scandalous stories in Alexander Yemelianenko's career.
Yemelyanenko played his last match in January of this year, losing a technical knockout to fellow countryman Dmitri Sosovski.
Alexander is the younger brother of the more famous fighter Fedor Yemelianenko.

Anger turned out to be the most universal and functional human emotion
The heart expression of the face is biologically universal to humanity, and every organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not by chance but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, learned by scholars from Australia and the United States.
They spoke about their discoveries in Evolution and Human Behavior magazine, and briefly about them can be read in a press release from the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - the swirled and lowered eyebrows drawn into the thin line of lips, the bloated nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and makes it even the birthless children who never saw it, is noted by the lead author of the study Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists found that this emotion had arisen to effectively manage disputes during the conflict.
The more physical harm one person can do to another, the more he is able to dictate his conditions, and he communicates it to the interlocutor through anger.
Researchers have also found evidence of another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and to resort to physical abuse, consider themselves entitled to impose adverse conditions on others, and prefer violent methods of resolving conflicts peacefully.
Based on the fact that anger is primarily an “emotion of bargaining”, scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create the angry expression of the face must represent the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interviewer - and thus force him to accept its terms as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, researchers modeled on the computer faces where each of the seven elements of the angry face was present or missing, and showed them to the informants.
Although the lower eyebrows or the forward chin did not individually make the face angry, the more physically powerful pictured person was unanimously acknowledged by the study.
The anger of man, like that of animals, is a threat: an exaggerated exercise of self-power that compels consent and submission.
A man blowes his nostrils and presses his lips for the same purpose as a frog that inflates, or a baboon that shows his fangs.
“Anger is `launched' by the interlocutor's refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form most effectively showing the opposite side the consequences of the refusal.
But most striking - that none of the components of the angry face is arbitrary, all of them express the same thing," said anthropologist John Toubi.
The Ministry of Communications has offered 250 million rubles to the Crimea television and radio company.
The Ministry of Communications has proposed that 250 million rubles be allocated from the federal budget in 2014 to the autonomous non-profit organization Crimea Teleradiocom Company.
This is mentioned in the draft government decree prepared by the agency consulted by Lenta.ru.
According to the Explanatory Note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be directed “to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive informational coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of a modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, it is intended to convert the hardware and studio unit, the video walls, the central hardware and video server.
The acquisition of a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter is also planned.
In addition, the company will pay for the use of the fibre-optic link (VOLS) and the maintenance of the energy system from the funds allocated.
Grants will be provided within the federal budget of the Ministry of Communications.
The State Broadcasting Company Crimea was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, television coverage of the radio and television company is more than 75 per cent of the peninsula.
In 2011, Crimea Teleradio Company was licensed to broadcast digitally.
