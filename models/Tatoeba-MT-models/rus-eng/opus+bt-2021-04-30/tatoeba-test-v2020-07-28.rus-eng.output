This soup is given by fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He talks too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
You didn't know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to buy time.
I've already discussed it with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among humans, spoke in the terrible, from the Jewish perspective, Galilean dialect of the Aramaic language instead of Hebrew, thus demonstrating the failure of claims of the existence of any sacred language, the use of which in prayers makes it particularly close to God.
In the end, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
Tom was paid $300 for this.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
The weather forecast wasn't wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll have Tom make you something to eat.
I'm gonna go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.

And I'm very pleased to meet you.

I can't help Tom.
Is that my book?
Washing is a routine job.
Who else is on your list?
Don't give Tom my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I wish I knew what to tell them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you should talk to them.
He reads physics at Oxford.
He was hiding that fact from me.
Did you save me?
He snored loud in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?

Someone said something, but I didn't.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I never cared about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I sat next to Tom.
You sound upset.
Have you always been so selfish?
I think this cure will be of great use to you.
Tell Tom to be here by half past three.
It's not God's message. It's science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it'll rain.
Would you like a beer?
Where did you see him?

The bus was full.
Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is that?
I'm hung over.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car sells well.
I have to work this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words embarrassed me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom had to do.
Tell her I said hi.
Was that a lie?
Tom's response was shocking.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom back?
I have to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it at the store.
The world is cruel.
I'm having a good dream.
He doesn't care about anyone but himself.
I'm from Shizuoka.
Tom cut down all the trees in his backyard.
Saturday is the day he's free.
I wonder what happened to her.

Don't blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom's screaming at Mary.
It's my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
I thought Tom said Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very insightful.
Over and over again, obstacles appear in our lives, some call them problems, others talk about opportunities for growth.
Thanks for taking him fishing.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
He told me he wanted out of the company.

We sold our souls for money.
Are you working tonight?
The wind's up.
I rarely met her.
I know it's really important.
I'm eating an apple.

Should we go?
I knew I could count on you!
Tom put the wood in the fire.
"Love never killed anyone." "Does it? Ask Romeo and Juliet".
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It's like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I shouldn't have let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd come back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving yet?
Neither Tom nor Mary have ever been to Boston.
Have you ever sucked?
If I had money, I'd buy a computer.
Tom smiles?
She went to Paris.
Tom's in school now, right?
Please let us know.
Tom nodded and headed for the door.
It was just a joke.
Try proving me wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Does it hurt anywhere?
He couldn't go because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how it works.
Open the door or we'll break it in!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't give up French.
I think Tom can be trusted.
There's a lot of mystery in life.
Isn't it too salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's a rotten apple.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Tom's favorite city.
It's a shame someone's dying.
Are you feeling better?
What makes you think we might be interested?
I'll think of you every day while I'm gone.
That was a bad bet.
The thought of her going alone bothered me.
The river flows dimensionally.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I've been watching them.
Do you really love her?
He gave a statement of facts without comment.
It was dark green.
He'll definitely come.
You got a message?
Yesterday, Tom called me unexpectedly.
We really need that.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.
I've decided to give up.
The accident took their only son.
Everybody knows there's something new in this old capital.
I'm always careful.
I went to the market.

Did they say when?
This car looks angry.
Do you study English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money for a new dress.
Why is the moon glowing at night?
I couldn't understand anything Tom said.

Tom did it on purpose.
Let's think about it.
I know Tom wants you to do it.
Tom said he didn't know anything about the robbery.
Do you know everyone here?
Tom couldn't read until he was 13.
I prefer quail eggs.
She lives in Muhosransk.
Those people who aren't smarter than me, I'm not interested.
Is this your first time in Australia?
The owls are wise.

I have an assignment for Tom.
"How did the accident happen?" "Nobody knows."
What do you like about him?
When I got to the station, I called my friend.
I need to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Don't believe anything he says.
Tom got rid of his foreign accent.
We all knew it would happen sooner or later.
No one disagreed.

I fell asleep on his shoulder.
I know you work hard.
I love Ural languages.
I hope you're wrong about that.
Sometimes you have to tell the truth.
Tom's a pusher.
I have a proposition for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are planning on getting married on October 20.
If you want to be alone, I'll go.
He's got a lot of talent.
He's in a bad mood.
How would you like to be called?
He has a father who's Japanese.
Who would want to kill him?
I was in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was exhausted.
He's in school till late at night.
Tom's room is very small.
Do you speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
This song is doomed to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we knew.
I'm proud of him.
I just got home.
Tom burns both wood and coal in his oven.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We need to be trained.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom threw Mary his keys.
I talk to him all the time.
I can't help but laugh at her jokes.
By means of the prophet Zechariah, God made the confluence of kingship and priesthood in Jesus Christ.
You want me to talk to Tom myself?
Each of us went to his house.
It's thin, but it's tough and it doesn't burst.
It's all a little silly.
I don't know what I want right now.
It's incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six-five for TV viewers!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom is interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really that bad?
Tell me where you'll live, please.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we get Tom?
Tom said I was ugly.
Do you cry a lot?
We did not expect such results.
I've read it before.
If the car breaks down, we'll walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Did you find anything interesting?
Everybody does.
I visit my family a lot.
He'll be expelled from our club.
You should be punished for what you did.
They went up the stairs.
She has to drink water.
It's one of the ugliest buildings I've ever seen.
The robber broke into the post office in broad daylight.
That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My desk is old.
We're both very busy.
The darkness is unsightly.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll pick you up.
Tom tried to drown himself in the bath.
Tom and I are the same size.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Mary's younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
The book is big.
Don't talk like that about Tom.
I thought I made myself clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Time may change, but human nature is still the same.
Tom seems pretty upset.
I brought the cookies.
Next year, Tom will be teaching French.
I've listened to her to the end.
I advised Tom to rest.
Why does that piss you off?
The worst part of the trip is over.
We'll miss you both.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do that!
That knife really came in handy.
How do you know what I had?
You'll only have a minute.
That's a situation I'd really like to change.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to believe any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a squirrel in a wheel.
He never got over it.
Do you want to come with us?
Does Tom know how to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We're planning to leave as soon as possible.
He went skiing on Hokkaido.
"Shut your fucking music and read the book." "See, my censoring spell is still working!"
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed it with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no saving for her.
I'm sorry I did this without you.
You're bleeding out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants what you want.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where's the supermarket around here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't recognize Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're lying, join me.
Tom wanted to apologize to Mary again.
Tom was thinking.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He was never there.
I really wish I could go with you, but I can't.
It's never happened before.
I wasn't gonna do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Hurry up or you'll be late for school.
Did you ever write a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary switched places.
How do they carry you out?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful man, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is at risk.
Mary made Alice a new dress.
That decision was difficult to make.
I thought you'd be thirsty.
I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
Tom didn't have to leave.
Mary recovered from her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
Eating meat is harmful to your health and your environment.
You're telling me you don't know anything about this?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom can't enjoy life.
I want you to put in a good word for me.
Nobody loves me.
I wish I knew Tom's phone.
"Tom knows." "Yes, did you tell him?" "No, he found out himself."
Your explanation was very understandable.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you just thought of something dirty.
Sugar is the world's largest source of dust.
What do you like most about Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for a signal to start.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We've got a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom will pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is a weeping willow.
I don't have this book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is at the center of the solar system.
Are you a cop?
Tom failed both me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut myself with a razor.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
The river irrigated the garden.
The strong wind is quiet at night.
Ants and giraffes are distant relatives.
Tom did it because I told him so.
I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom was carrying two suitcases.
Tom didn't seem to recognize me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just got off the phone with your teacher.
I'm used to sleeping early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.
All Tom does is watch TV.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the best pear I've ever eaten.
I had a parking problem.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
She's not mine.
Do you know what this is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom was never late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go ask your father.
Do you still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each sheet.
You're hard to take seriously.
The members of the tribe settled along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When did it start?
Nobody cares what she thinks.
I don't think that's weird at all.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom gave it to me."
When are you going to clean the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Does it make sense to fix it?
Why are you locking the door?
Tom said he tried it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at 8:00 in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You don't know how to write programs.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's short, but strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Can you find Tom, please?
He'll give it to you.
This sentence is not clear.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
Don't you see what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom divorced Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
This box weighs a ton.
He gets everything because he's an ass.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
He seemed to be going to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
I don't think that's gonna happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
Yesterday I was free all day, and today I'm working.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
When you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a terrible man!
Carton's stronger than paper.
Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your authority.
The curse was destroyed.
Tom's great-grandfather was born blind.
Tom's taller than you, isn't he?
She hurt her back playing tennis.
Tom's easily scared.
This table is white.
It was a strange game.
I've heard about all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm going to Boston with you.
Let me talk to Tom.
They went to a mountain resort last summer.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay out of there.
Tom and Mary are not afraid.
Can you come closer?
She's a little shy.
What do you expect Tom to do?
She seemed perfectly calm.
Press the button.
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
Tom was intrigued by what was happening.
Mary wore boots to her knee.
That's a lie.
I'll keep an eye on them.
She said she had a cold.
The traffic inspector was extremely rude.
Tom wants to follow in his father's footsteps.
I don't see a problem here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's terribly bitter.
Did Tom tell you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Tom was the first one last time.
Everybody's different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put a tree over there.
Do you usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom's gonna fix this.
Tom said goodbye to his sister.
My mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't know what you're trying to say.
Little pots have long pens.
Tom was in sandals.
There's a bench under the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How do you like my story?
Tom turned off his alarm and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you singing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
Tom plays guitar a lot.
I tried to warn Tom.
The train was full.
Tom rarely wears a tie.
You bought too much bread.
He says he doesn't plan to go.
I have two dogs, three cats, and six chickens.
Does Tom have a cable?
Whatever you say, I won't change my mind.
Tom can talk.
Thank him for his help.
Tom could have told me.
It will bring misery to your family.
I was very nervous.
Tom said I had to go.
I have to win.
It's useless to ask him for help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You should try not to sleep.
Mom's really helping me out.
Tom has a snake tattooed on his back.
You bought meat at the supermarket?
He hit me by mistake.
What's the dog's name?
Follow the sidewalk.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's father is.
It rains like a bucket.
The whole country's talking about it.
I can't wait to tell him.
You can't buy happiness.
Tom grew up in a children's home.
I don't want to watch this video.
The poorest country in the EU is poorer than the poorest state in the United States?
Say hi to Tom for me.
I want to thank you for what you did for Tom.
I came across a friend of mine.

You're both idiots.
Do you like living out of town?
How long did it take you to do this?
We finally have everything we need.

We need to know what Tom looks like.
I made a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.

How far is Paris?
What time is it in Tokyo?
He said he hoped to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.

No one knew why.
Jim's not coming tonight.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take off your shoes?
We went to the beach.
Do you think there's gonna be snow this year for Christmas?
How was Tom's party?

I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me as well.

Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.

I didn't know exactly where to start.
That's a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom made pancakes.
He dictated several letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you wearing pajamas?
How much does it cost?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
The cup of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
Are you Canadian?

Someday you'll thank me.
Tom sometimes watches TV.
Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I'm still not thinking straight.
Run, chickens!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
I'm sick of you!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current state of affairs.
I know what you told her.
I didn't fall asleep until two in the morning.
Mary was not thirsty.
Tom wasn't as hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom up.
They say that movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
Apparently, she's healthy.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
Keep an eye on your brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter peppers.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I put milk in the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I've never betrayed you.
We used to do it together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincibles.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can draw.
They're dirty.
I didn't know it wouldn't be possible.
Are you having fun?
A man was sentenced to death.
Was it snowing yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you measure it?

He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.

I was impressed.
I advise you not to go.
We didn't discuss it.

Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the beast.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary in self-defense.
How does faith differ from trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather allows, we'll climb the top of the mountain tomorrow.
She and I both know each other.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could have gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of God Ra.

What kind of pizza do you like the most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take some more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands got blue from the cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
It's hard for me to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed a lot of houses.
This man was condemned to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you wearing my shoes?
Power is in Tom's hands.
I learned to practice and play as my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's going to blame you.
I'm not really busy right now.
Children like to play more than learn.
He was thought to be his little brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is that red or white?
We're not afraid of fighting.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's go!
Do it before it gets dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
Is moustache suddenly fashioned?
Tom said he wouldn't want to waste that much time.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born the day before yesterday.
Tom's wearing a pirate costume.
It's true!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did the best I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll help you out.
We are proud of our achievement.
Tom should have invited Mary.
Tom should have been punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop hitting the cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime did you commit?
How do we know this man is who he says he is?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald Sinezuby, introduced Christianity into Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go into this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Herman Hesse.
To tell you the truth, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases come to trial, it is generally accepted that there should be twelve persons on the jury.

I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was going to do it.
It's been another day.
You have to do this right now.
I have to go to X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got mosquito bites all over my arm.
Tom, come on, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you watching your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonalds is worldwide known for his burgers.
Tom made Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like these perfumes?
The lock's broken.
Diamond is a gem.
Help yourself to a cookie, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Stand down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How'd you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want what's best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why are so many people suffering from low self-esteem?
Was it too easy?
What Alice faced while waiting for an answer was a sudden war.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
You can't go in there.
Tom helped Mary get her stuff in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did is wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom was reluctant to give Mary the money she asked of him.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I tried to solve the problem in vain.
You were supposed to do your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That stone was so heavy, I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
It'll come back as soon as it comes back.
We rented canoes.
Have you ever tried banana pie?
The girl who gave me the beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to the kids?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed a tree.
The language I'm teaching is very complicated.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Do you really live alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president has been ruling for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Would you mind solving that?
Both Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
There's 20 floors in the building.
If you're not coming, I'm not going either.
You wouldn't happen to know when Tom's coming back?
I don't have pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a little bit?
You're gonna give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
Next month I'll be very busy.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then he would have been a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There's a strong wind coming up.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you do.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag's empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's as stubborn as a donkey.
I think you can be relied on.
She knew she was wrong.
It's so cool!
Tom had a feeling Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom spoke in his sleep last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say it again!
I called him, but some girl picked up the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very hard on the kids.
How's the negotiations going?
He's prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I'm mixing mayonnaise with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got a little mustache.
Do you understand what she said?
You seem distracted.
Don't make her angry.
I'd rather stay.
Tom came up with a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place safe?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I suspect Tom should go to Boston next week.
Don't walk through other people's land.
Tom was terrified to watch.
Tom's face is red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where are you and Tom staying?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done here.
How do you like your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger for him was an abstract concept; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the hall.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs were hurting.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to talk to you about something important for both of us.
We need to get you to a hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it often.
I hope we don't do this again.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, it's opening time.
I'm not sure how big she is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas retired from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help but think about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire him?
He and I were crying.
Would you like to try it again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you dressed like that?
You can make butter, cheese, and so on out of milk.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, remember those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
You didn't think to ask Tom for help?
It's worth a shot.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
No one's hungry but me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflake in the snow avalanche feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll take care of it.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When will the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He wide-opened his mouth.
It's just a spit.
I really liked this book.
You're important.
When the ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she'd stay the night.
Tom didn't tell the cop his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I was sick.

I feel like an amoeba.
Our team came home in triumph.
I went alone.
Tom married the older girl.
I listened to him.
Why aren't you sleeping?

I try not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look crazy.
I appreciate your help.
He couldn't hold the smile.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?

Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was swimming in the river.
Tell them to pick up the phone.
Can you tell us what this is?
Say no to racism.

That's the wrong data.
There is a marked difference between them.

Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's pretending.
Come closer.
We're staying at the Hilton Hotel.
He should tell Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.

Tom didn't tell us why he was so upset.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anyone.

I knew it was something like that.
You have nothing to hide, do you?
You're lying to me.

Is the exam going today?
What motivates you?
You gave Layla your computer.
Roll up your sleeves.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom would agree to meet us?
They say anyone in America can become president, but it probably isn't.

You have to come back.
We already talked.
I can't believe I finally did it.

Don't worry, the test's light.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know which book to choose.
Tom didn't get it at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white cotton shirt.
It's a tower.
I'll have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Does anyone here know them?
They're watching you.
How long do you need?
I think Tom remembers me.
We can do that.
He knows his faults.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.

What are you talking about?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find the hotel.
She's no stronger than I am.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't force people to do this.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I hate that color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still single.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
The neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She also has shortcomings.
I wonder why Tom would do that.
It seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom's not the only one from Boston.
Will you support me?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
It's up to you to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter will be over soon.
Titles and rewards mean nothing to me.
Where did you even find him?
The meeting went on.
I recognize you.
Did you have a good day off?
Tom's drinking beer.
If you don't want to do it, don't do it!

Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Get Tom a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Get it together!

Tom can get jealous.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you associate your childhood with?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom used a floor jack.
I'd like to lie down.
Lend me some notes or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight, and I don't want to leave the house.
He'll be here today.

I won't make that mistake again.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I persuaded her to marry him.
I've waited my whole life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane went into the corkscrew.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any correspondence friends in Indonesia?
You might have to help her.
Mary passed out.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you go to the concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hello," Tom said timidly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
They're running.
The road does not match the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any other questions?
A new sentence as a message in a bottle: one day it'll be translated.
You're not gonna get a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
We're soul mates.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.

Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?

The series should start watching when all seasons have been filmed!
Road accidents occur every day.
Where did you go skiing?
Were you at the hairdresser's?
The prospect is bleak.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ball pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept in two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Get lost.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's all take a picture together.
I failed on the exam.
Everyone already knew that.
You'd better go help her.
The football player made a huge mistake.
Are they coming, too?

The explosion rocked the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged.
That's my cat.
Do you have children yet?
Tom didn't want breakfast.
Tom likes them.
Tom doesn't even know why he got expelled from school.
Tom is a presumptuous idiot.
It keeps me up at night.
He's been transferred to another department.
I think you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks it's a sin to throw away food.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about it yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I'm sure of it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom wiped the whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
It's the nicest thing I've ever met.
How much did it cost?
I need to see you immediately.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I used to be.

The man who stole the pin will steal the cow.
Tom doesn't swim very well, does he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just a shadow of himself.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Things happen.
What day is it?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm just a guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily on the lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he was coming with us.

Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't match us.
I saw the car explode.
The window is here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw out my Placement.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Hold still!
What's your favorite TV show?
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's on fire!
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
I love going to school.
I offered to help.
I'm going back to Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog's yours.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm gonna go to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer has instilled courage in his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying something like this right now.
I don't know much about hunting.
It's the first time I've made grilled meat at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why would they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone already knew that.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe that's what she said.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw the way he looked at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom should be home.
She was the one I thought she was.
Tom showed the police officer his driver's license.
I cut my hair every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's a sour apple.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalog.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go fishing too.
You're taking your work home?
According to mythology, Prometheus stole sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All the passengers managed to get out of the bus before it caught fire.
I want to help you deal with this.
You speak French better than I do.
There's a lot of talented people in this town, but Tom doesn't belong to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking checks.
My bike's gone.
Stars shimmered in the night sky.
I doubt Tom's gonna win.
"Oh, here you are so bored." "As it says, only Link can defeat Ganon." "So what can we do?" "That's great! I'll grab my sword!" "Ah, no!" "No, no, no," "Here's an axe with a skull." "No," "How about 'ah, father'"? "No," "How about smoke bombs?" "No," "Oh, hell, how about that gun?" "Yes!"
Do you know who sings this song?
Is your watch going right?
I'll see you on Sunday at 3:00.

Tom slept without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What kind of music are you listening to in the car?
I was told that three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French Revolution began during the reign of Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to swim in the sea.
It'll depend entirely on him.
I met a classmate.
He's old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our town was wrapped in smog.
No one saw them leave the room.
Two big coffees, please.
We were talking about you.
What kind of music do you normally listen to?
Without bread, food is not food.
Tomorrow's gonna be snow.
You should have quit smoking a long time ago.
Stop joking!
Some of my classmates are full of nukes, they don't know anything about computers.
Did you like the bike?
I thought Tom wasn't sleeping.
Tom wasn't allowed to leave.
I didn't find them right away.
Hurry up, please, Tom's waiting.
Listen to what the teacher says.
She looks amazingly like Marilyn Monroe.
I know who we can turn to for help.
I'm stronger than you.
She felt deep regret when she looked back on her life.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.
I swear I didn't see her.
I really loved him.
Tom and I noddded.
In politics, respect is hard to earn, but easy to lose.
Stop acting like a baby!
Let's go.
They're starting to believe their own lies.
Don't pick him up.
Tom wants to dye his hair.
I've never seen her here before.
Why do I have to work with Tom?
I think it was your fault.
You think that's the best way to rule?
If I tell you what's going on, I'll be killed.

I'm still shocked.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I doubt Tom's still angry.
You'll be better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell burned rubber?
That's not what happened here.
When's your father coming home?
I understand.

I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of the shower.

She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom will try to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's dying.
Tom said it wasn't enough.

I already talked to this student.
What chemical mark is methyl hydrogen acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

Tom was dressed as a janitor.
I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
The skyscraper is in the middle of town.
Who sent you?
She tied him a sweater.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine, call cheaper?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You're not using it, are you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
How long are you planning on staying?
We ate quickly and left immediately.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start every meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you ever call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right in front of me.
The calica was open.
I brought wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.

What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
You don't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing it or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday party.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
Last year, she learned how to ride a bike.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since it was winter, he didn't go outside.
Walking down the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses on your street?
The elephant tusks are made of ivory.
I'm not a child anymore.
"What's up, Mike?" "My name's Tom."
Her native language is French.

She stopped for a smoke.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naiveness is his only positive quality.
My hobby is the collection of insects.
Tom lived as a child in Boston.
I haven't eaten in six days.
Can I tell them that?
She's been quiet all day.

It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
To many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I turned on the imagination.
I thought we could do this.
My mom didn't want me driving alone.
I'm sorry, I misread you.
You know what you're doing, right?
You can't trust a machine translation.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There's plenty of fish in this river.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
We're the same age as her.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms before?
The prisoner is released.
What did they say happened?
Could you leave the door open?
That'll have to wait.

In Japan, the climate is mild.
Check again.

Tom's watching.
It stopped raining, we can open the windows again.
It's never happened to me before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was gonna go out when the phone rang.
I don't have to take it.
Always give way to interference on the right.
We're being asked to introduce ourselves one at a time.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a lift if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing's as relaxing as a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice is like a melody song of siren to me.

Tom pretended to be busy.
I have no one to trust.
She's a fan of Sex in the Big City.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Treat him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long working day.

The child is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be lit.
My birthday falls on Sunday this year.
Tom was armed with a rifle and a knife.
You won't forget them.
Everyone in my school knows my name.
I knew you'd miss me.
I couldn't find his house.
I'm thinking about going to Australia next spring.
Someone's coming.
He was waiting by the window for an hour.
I baked these cookies for them.
You're twisting my words.
Let's get back to lesson three.
Tom doesn't get home much.
I hope you feel at home.
I'm still waiting.
This soup is delicious, isn't it?
A lot of people were waiting.
There's a bottle in the fridge.
I still can't believe Tom hates Mary.
Tom didn't tell me when he'd be here.
Tom really likes you.
Can you do that for me?
There's not much I can do for you right now.
I'm here because they asked me to come.
Shortly before the explosion, a man was seen acting suspiciously.
He's sitting with his legs crossed.
I definitely heard a scream.
There are many foreign tourists in Asakusa.
I wrote it for Tom.
You're not married?
Tom must have been drunk.
Did Tom tell you where he was going?
He's no richer than me.
If only I could tell you!
She missed the train.
I go to the sea in the summer, and I go to the mountains in the winter.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
You know everything about me.
An elderly man lives alone.
You're so stupid.
He's almost never angry.
You're a little tense.
I don't know how to do that.
What would make you happy?
I'll be there on Monday, Tom on Tuesday, and Mary on Wednesday.
Is it safe to eat raw eggs?
What's the height of Empire State Building?
Hey, how are you?
Neither Tom nor Mary did anything illegal.
Unfortunately, it's true.
Can we lock that door?
I don't know what to say.
What are you all doing here?
The police arrested the robber.
Keep Tom in the dark.
I'm not going to school today.
You two come with me.
Tom drank red wine and Mary was white.
I read the article.
It used to be theirs.
He doesn't even notice me.
He's a disgrace to the whole city.
Are you stressed out?
The dove was stealing everything.
That's my favorite.
I don't think anyone's noticed what Tom's doing.
I'm not selling my soul.
It's not my house.
They should be moving fast.
I think you've paid too much for that.
I'll take it.
I wanted to eat pizza.
She said she didn't want to sleep.
You don't have time.
You're taller than all of us.
I was born here.
I asked my supervisor to raise my salary.
Do you have any idea how much trouble you've caused?
Could you walk me out?
Maria covered her face with her hands.
What if he's wrong?
Tom looks a little like his father.
We never talked about it.
I know what that means.
I had to act quickly.
Mary said she'd do it herself.
Don't you remember how I told you all this?
These girls just want to have fun.
I spoke to the doctors in French.
Robots are used to make cars.
Tom's punctuality was never different.
Tom and Mary are asleep.
They were all surprised to see me there.
Drink to my health!
He cut himself with a knife yesterday.
The singer suddenly moves on to the falcette.
You don't have a fever.
Thank you so much for that information.
I can't afford to buy a new bike, so I'm gonna have to go with this old one.
Tom doesn't think there's life on Mars.
I can't stay here all day.
I became a lawyer to help people.
I paid Dan a visit.
I met him a few months ago.
These gloves belong to him.
She doesn't look more than 60 years old.
Can you trust her?
She's a talented singer.
I've done it many times.
Don't play poker with them.
Tom's very upset about something.
I'll call her right away.
I want to dedicate this song to Tom.
Tom gave me Mary's phone number.
Tom held the rope with both hands.
Tom doesn't pay attention to Mary.
Tom lives in the same building as me.
Don't blame others for your mistakes.
I thought Tom was coming to see us.
I never lied to her.
Tom burned his fingers on the stove.
They took her.
Mary could've done that if she'd tried.
Tom asked Mary where she wanted to go for lunch.
Can I have one, too?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with his classes?
Tom likes oranges.
It's an ongoing plan.
We want Tom to say yes.
I've been thinking about them all day.
I can't read or write.
How's Tom now?
Tom left on time.
Tom stopped there for a few days.
X-ray showed two fingers broken.
Tom said Mary's hungry.
Tom had to go there.
It was a fantastic day.
I said good night.
Try to escape.
Let's wait a minute.
Laws must be respected.
Tom made Mary wait a long time.
Do you know anything about Tom?
I'm doing this for the money.
We were just talking about you.
Excuse me, can I get a check?
I thought you'd laugh.
Mary's wearing two sweaters.
You see Tom, you'll understand.
I want to hire them.
I'm sure he's smart.
What road should I go?
Were you born there?
That's not what I hear anymore.
He said it was nine.
The butterfly was flying.
There's no time for that.
Both of these suitcases are mine.
Prices are rising.
She's not wrong.
I'll finally tell Tom today what I really think of him.
Don't be mad at me.
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you.
Do you like to sing?
I love the winter.
Show me her picture.
They trusted you.
He was born in America.
Tom certainly doesn't think so.
He called me just when I was about to go to bed.
If I can do it, so can you.
The sun warmed his skin.
Tom promised to come back.
Tom doesn't want me to go.
