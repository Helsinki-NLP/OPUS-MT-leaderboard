In Kineshma and the district, two men committed suicide
Previously, one of the hangers had already attempted suicide.
On October 30, around 1-00, in Lugoje village, a 1947 man was born by hanging himself.
He is known to have attempted suicide before.
What prompted a man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, 11–50, a 41-year-old man, resident of Kineshma, committed suicide by hanging at his place of residence.
No signs of violent death have been found, as reported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs press service, Kineshemsky.
Is there a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair a loose highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box carefully built on your car's dashboard.
These devices, which track every mile a motorist passes and convey this information to officials, are at the heart of a controversial attempt to modernize America's outdated highway financing system undertaken by Washington and state planners.
Usually, the boring highway planning arena unexpectedly gave rise to intense debates and colorful alliances.
Libertarians joined environmental groups in lobbying for the government's right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you drive, and perhaps even where you drive them, and then use this information in tax accounts.
The tea party movement is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy.
Although Congress cannot yet agree whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They wonder how, over the next decade, we can move to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of the road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
"This is not a matter on which we may have the right to choose," said Hassan Ihrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which is preparing plans to start tracking the state of miles passed by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology for that is already in place.
This need is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government's Highway Foundation, funded by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans don't buy as much petrol as they used to.
Cars drive more than one gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians don't want to raise the tax by even one cent at high gasoline prices.
"The gas tax simply cannot be saved," said Lee Mannitch, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his staff, 500 tracking devices had recently been installed on vehicles to test the pardon system.
"This will be the best alternative in the long run," he said.
The nerds call it a soft user's pay.
Not surprisingly, this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California look to the system in developing strategies to meet the targets set by the state's ambitious anti-global warming laws.
However, House member Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the Chamber's transport committee, said that he too saw the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free market adherents at the Reason Foundation are also thrilled to make drivers pay for every mile.
"It's not just a tax that's going to go to a black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President for Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards a mercy payment.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would involve about 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of the concerns of rural legislators representing voters, who often had to travel many miles to work or to the city in daily life.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers are about to pay the state for miles of running instead of a gas tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It's being considered in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes transport departments from 17 states of the eastern coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer vehicles were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could monitor every move.
"The concern about "big brother" and similar things is a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who is in charge of strategy and performance management in the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the trials were well under way, the Nevada branch of the American Civil Liberties Union warned on its website, "It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices."
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to keep records of the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of several states where there is a difficult search for low-cost technology that would allow the state authorities to keep track of the miles driven by the car, but without information about the place and time.
If you can do it, Han said, society will feel more comfortable.
Searching for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Originally, this company did not assist in collecting state taxes.
It sought to enter the developing market for the form of car insurance in which drivers pay on the basis of mileage.
But the devices she's testing attract road designers because they don't use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't track their speed and track their location," said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There were some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are far less expensive and less obsessive ways to do so.
In Oregon, designers experiment with providing drivers with different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can totally abandon the device by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state pass.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea to the alert public, forcing devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax device that will also accept parking counter fees, provide "pays as you drive" insurance, and collect a real-time speed data pool from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Automobiles will bring in the benefits that will be offered to them," says the urban design document.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder whether all the talk of a pardon is simply a huge distraction.
At the San Francisco Gulf City Transportation Commission, officials say that Congress could easily overturn the bankruptcy of the trust fund for highway construction by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you have to do is take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Law and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
EU prepares support measures for Ukraine in case of Russian economic pressure
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on emergency credit if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association treaty between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
A stand-by loan is being negotiated with the IMF, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their goal is to reach an agreement soon.
In addition to the potential credit from the IMF, Ukraine could receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF can overcome long-standing differences on the terms of financing.
He does not believe in the possibility of the reforms needed to obtain aid, nor does the international rating agency S&P, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step to B-B on Friday.
However, the EU representatives said that IMF could be flexible in lending terms, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country's financial support plan, the EU has a back-up option to provide Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which is now coming from Russia.
It could be gas from the Northern Flow or reverses from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia "insulates" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this mode of reverse supply to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks and is likely to lead to a decline in supply to other regions.
"There are negotiations between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources rather than from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," added Reuters.
Russia Without Car Pollution
Attempts to address the transport problems of major cities have been made in most mega-cities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
These were usually either the redevelopment and extension of the highways or attempts to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of vehicles and the time they were used.
The case of Singapore is well known, where strict quotas have been introduced for the growth of private cars and the right to purchase them is purchased at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced fees for entry into the city centre.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, allowing only vehicles with a certain eco-class to enter, using also high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a “five-year clean air plan” with a total cost of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to IA, Director of Transport Pollution Control, Beijing City Environmental Protection Bureau Lee Kunscheng, the primary goal of the five-year-old is to reduce leading air pollutants by 20-35 per cent by 2017, to increase the number of private cars to no more than 6 million (now 5.2 million), and to increase fuel use by no more than 5 per cent per vehicle.
According to the agency, cars in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme include limiting the use of road transport as well as introducing additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the city's green five-year-old measures include an accelerated transition to Euro-fuel standards compared with the rest of the country, the introduction of a local eco-standard and car and fuel labelling system, a restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, a ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition to the introduction of incentive financial programmes to replace old vehicles with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and official transport), and the development of public transport (including high-speed transport).
Car innovations in Beijing also include the ban on all private cars to drive within the fifth transport ring (six in total in the capital PRC) one day a week (relevant information is contained in the vehicle licence plate) and the issue of lottery-based car registrations (e.g. in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only one third of 2010).
According to the current State programme “Environmental Protection 2012-2020”, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should decrease to 128 (in 2012, there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011 “mobile sources” accounted for 41 per cent of all emissions of pollutants to the urban atmosphere.
In Moscow, for example, car emissions are ten times higher than industrial emissions and in St. Petersburg, nine times higher.
The Russian Federation is just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
The Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the HSE, Mikhail Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at curbing the demand for road travel are notoriously unpopular, and can be adopted by society only if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its vehicle fleet, where there are two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulatory impact - service and personal cars, as well as cars of “privileged” users with a total of at least 200,000 (about 5% of Moscow's total fleet).
In the recent period, urbanists from the ECOM centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study analysing the balance of urban areas between residential development, road surface and the number of vehicles.
The main findings of the researchers are that the city centre is provided with roads half as much as required, and most of the motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them for long periods of time in parking or simply in the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build car storage facilities rather than to expand, but to reduce the carriageway (to make the streets more friendly to pedestrians) and to restrict the use and location of personal transport within the security area of the historic centre (a total area of about 3,212 hectares covering a number of central areas of the city).
Fines for unauthorized street trade in Wogonda will rise to a point
In the opinion of the city authorities, an increase in fines will help to bring order to the Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the products they sell often do not pass the corresponding sanitary controls.
Which means that the health of the Vojans is in danger.
Thus, the lower limit for citizens for unauthorized trade will increase sixfold since November, from 500 rubles to 3,000 rubles, as reported by the Press Service of the Vologda Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of increasing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment on unfunded consumer credit and a massive reduction of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of that growth.
It has recently been entirely driven by consumption, which is almost unchanged," said the chief economist of Goldman Sachs for Russia, Clemence Grafe, presenting yesterday's quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
The nominal wage increase in Russia is now around 10%.
With an inflation of 6%, he will be able to provide future consumer demand at about current levels, expected in Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so they are likely to optimise staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages rise by 10 per cent, GDP by only 2 per cent, Mr. Grafe explained.
Companies have experienced reduced profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to dismissals and increased unemployment.
Russian business cannot raise wages, commenting on Russia and CIS Vladimir Pantuşin by the chief economist Barclays Capital.
Unemployment near historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
Employers have to raise salaries in order to lure employees from outside or to retain current employees.
Russia’s demand for support is also growing very rapidly.
According to Mr. Grafe, this type of lending has not had a multiplier effect on the country ' s economy because of the extremely high rates of consumer loans.
"The benefits to the economy from growing demand for credit have not been seen, money does not differ in the economy, but goes back to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem is, in Goldman Sachs, the default on unfunded loans is expected to increase.
They are taken mainly by poor people who have nothing to provide for them.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more often," noted Mr. Grafe.
Therefore, the second threat to growth in Russia is a possible non-payment crisis on unfunded loans.
Vasily Solodkov, the director of the WFE Banking Institute, is already seeing signs of an emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources available to State banks, were forced to raise funds at high interest rates.
In response, the state banks embarked on a war path and began to lower credit rates, as the economist continues.
Small credit organizations cannot issue loans at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks do not give up dumping, Russia is facing a full-fledged banking crisis, Vasily Solodkov believes.
The withdrawal of licences from a number of banks in recent weeks is seen by the economist as a precursor to a massive collapse.
"The state banks themselves will not deal with this situation: the deposit insurance system was originally not designed for a systemic crisis," the head of the institute warns.
But the increase in consumption will slow down and without a crisis of non-payment, are expected in an investment bank, because of the refusal to index the salaries of public servants and the military, as laid down in the current version of the draft budget.
The impact on consumption will be partially mitigated by the freezing of tariffs of natural monopolies (and consequently by the reduction of inflation).
But only in part: if investment does not grow (and the prerequisites for it are not yet - see the certificate), consumption growth will still slow down, confident of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for implementing pessimistic scenarios.
"Major risk is still a fall in oil prices," he says.
He estimated that the Russian economy would begin to decline at a cost of less than $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB is not yet in a position to reduce interest rates in the economy.
The paradoxical picture is that inflation has declined and banks have begun to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the CB announcing a transition to inflation targeting," Clemens Grafe said.
The Central Bank's interest rate policy does not affect market rates, only affects inter-bank lending rates.
"For the CB, this is the collapse of all hopes," Clemens Grafe praised.
The money received at the CD auctions is used by banks not to lend to the economy, but to manage their liquidity.
Once the rate goes down, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to get away with speculation against the ruble.
"At some point, the CB will realize that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Grafe and recalled that the state plans to put the ruble in "free sailing" by the end of 2015.
But we're either gonna have to do this sooner or raise the key bet of the CB (5.5%), he thinks.
According to his assessment, the ruble is now artificially overstated by 10%.
Ruble's only one way to weaken, the expert concludes.
But if the CB puts any doubt in the financiers that the elimination of the currency corridor is not part of a policy to weaken the ruble, it could bring down the ruble much stronger.
The Second Congress of the Peoples of Southern Ural was held in Chelyabinsk.
The Forum is on the occasion of the Day of Popular Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
The convention was attended by delegations from all the cities and regions of the region, representatives of national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive authorities - a total of about 350 persons.
The Forum ' s course is aimed at strengthening inter-ethnic harmony.
We can set an example here not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no differences or disagreements.
We live in full understanding," states Theophan, Metropolitan Chelyabinsky and Zlatoustovsky.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including the education of patriotism and cultural cooperation.
At the end of the convention, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued at the opera and ballet theatre.
This is where the exhibition of the national cultural associations of the Chelyabin region was opened.
Snowden is ready to "co-operate" with Germany on the U.S. intelligence issue.
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence whistleblower, stated that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander could not answer questions about his activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Streobele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, who the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, it was stated: “Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to view dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political speech with criminal charges that offer no defence”.
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
Charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense following allegations that NSA had tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who heads a parliamentary group in charge of the intelligence service, said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, "without endangering him or destroying his relationship with the United States completely", it should be used.
Mr. Streubele, MP for the Green Germany Party, published his photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Streubele said that, according to counsel for a former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would have needed assurances that he would be there "safe," said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a “hard and constant” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the world's response to "his political remarks".
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials — including in the United States — found the disclosure of an uncontrollable surveillance system beneficial to society.
The letter offers to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand baggage aboard their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their Wednesday announcement said that passengers could keep the entire can.
The new hand baggage charges extend to the bags in the upper luggage compartments, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said she would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if travellers paid only when they were at the landing gate.
Frontier's spokesman Kate O'Malley said the $100 charge should make the passengers take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge for this," she said.
The airlines began charging fees for the first and second luggage bags in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges fill as much as they can into a hand baggage storeroom placed in the upper luggage compartments, which often means there is a lack of space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection wasn't really about making money.
The thing is, Frontier's most loyal clients claim it's getting harder to find a place in the upper luggage compartments.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in line at the front of the Frontier flight may be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in line may pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that changing procedures on the website and at Frontier's registration desks is meant to ensure that passengers will know about the assembly before they get to the landing.
The new Frontier fee for hand baggage will not begin to be charged until summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about luggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that baggage handling costs money, and the passengers who need it have to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of loss.
However, most of them did not relate to hand baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first fee for hand baggage three years ago, and another Allegiant Air disk later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a collection is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the added charges.
According to his December 2011 report, the hand baggage charge brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines top manager, was recently flown by Spirit, and he was interested in what he would discover at the landing entrance when passengers faced an unusual Spirit collection for hand baggage.
"The landing process was the smoothest thing I've seen in my airline career," he said.
I was expecting to see the teeth scraping and a fight at the exit to land.
The plane was full, he said, "and landing went fast."
Frontier also follows Spirit for $2 per coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive soda or juice could keep the entire can and that coffee would be provided free of charge.
She'll still be distributing water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but refused seven months after passengers began complaining and no other major airline followed her example.
Frontier's initiative to charge for hand baggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its last move to attract customers to its website.
The airlines pay online ticket sellers such as Orbitz, between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than to contact a travel online agency.
However, Frontier went further than anyone in this area.
In September, she began to give half as many bonus miles to frequent flyer customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the bonus number of miles to 25 percent of the miles of travel.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would provide 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming a loss.
Revenue declined by 9 per cent, and flight opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results published on Wednesday by the parent company Republican Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to correct Frontier finance as part of the airline's sale.
NSA blames "internal error," not hackers for shutting down the site.
Covered by a secret National Security Agency on Friday night, it was stated that the shutdown of their site for a few hours had caused a technical breakdown, not hackers, as claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the scheduled update," reported the intelligence agency in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The statements that the interruption was caused by a distributed "service denial"-type attack [DDoS] are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSA website had not been operational for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
The NSA spokesman had previously told ABC News that the agency's internal secret network "unless" was hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the representative informed.
At least one online group of activist hackers stated that it was responsible for disableing the NSA website through the DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to capture the target site with traffic until servers are overloaded and the site fails.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The previously top secret NSA, once nicknamed "No such Agency", has been in the spotlight and fierce criticism in recent months after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and within the country — all a reaction to NSA secret files stolen from the agency and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency has sparked the notion that today's incident was the result of targeted hacking.
Bombardier's profits are declining as deliveries and aircraft orders fall.
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits on Thursday due to a reduced number of aircraft orders and supplies in the third quarter and contract problems in its railway unit.
The Montreal-based Bombardier company also did not publish any data on the flight trials of its latest CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial use would be implemented by the next September.
After the first flight of a prototype aircraft about a month and a half ago, it flew only three more times, raising questions as to whether the test phase was on schedule.
The results did not live up to expectations and led to a more than 8 per cent stock loss on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his rating on Thursday from "over the average market" to "medium-numbered" due to the belief that stock growth was limited in the next quarter or two.
"Although the decline in the number of aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the transport division's returns," Doerksen said in a stock market review.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market where Boeing and Airbus now dominate.
The first pilot aircraft was presented in March and flew for the first time in September after several months of delay.
However, firm CSeries orders are not yet too many, 177, as potential buyers await flight test results to verify the company's fuel efficiency and potential cost-effectiveness of the new liner.
There are currently 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
Chief Executive Pierre Baudouan was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 hard orders by the time the first plane was launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, leaders also assured analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward as planned.
"The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Boduan said during a telephone conference, adding that ground trials and software upgrades were planned during the plane's hiatus.
All manufacturers plan tests in different ways.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for the update, which is what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow it, as the company reported.
Still, analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first client will be able to operate the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier stated that it estimated the commissioning time and would provide new information in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight trials - although apparently in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, ending September 30, Bombardier's net income declined to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted return on the share remained the same, at 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents per share and gross income $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it delivered 45 aircraft in a quarter, down from 57 in the previous year.
The total number of orders dropped from 83 to 26.
The airline division's order portfolio was $32.9 billion on September 30, unchanged from December 31.
"In the aerospace field, the results were consistent with our objectives, but the low number of orders received and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor," Boduan said.
Gross revenue on the aerospace route fell by 13 per cent, to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, reported that gross revenue in this sector increased by almost 11 per cent, to $2.1 billion.
The order portfolio at the transport unit was $32.6 billion on September 30, a slight increase from December 31.
The revenue of the transport unit has been adversely affected by problems in the execution of several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced that Google's chief financial director Patrick Pichett would be on the board, fell by 8.5 percent, to C$4.83 at the middle of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony's counting on a lower annual profit.
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, having completed the past quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, has reduced the forecast of profits for the current fiscal year.
Sony's results between July and September 2013 proved to be more disappointing than expected, owing to the falling demand for television, video cameras, and personal computers produced by the Japanese Corporation.
Sony's television business, which in the second quarter produced the company's first operating surplus of 5.2 billion yen in three years, fell back to 9.3 billion yen operating loss in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through difficult times, especially due to the declining demand for television.
And while competitors seek a solution to the difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main rivals, Panasonic, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: sales of the company are growing at a high rate, especially through automotive systems and environmentally sound technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen in operating profits against the previously anticipated 230 billion yen.
However, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts expected the figure to be significantly higher, at 221 billion yen.
In an effort to overcome the crisis, Sony expands the food line.
In the middle of this month, the sale of smart clocks was announced from a Japanese corporation with a number of fashionable functions that would eliminate the need to pull a smartphone 100 times a day out of its pocket.
After Sony lowered the annual profit and revenue forecast, the company's shares at the opening of the Torogs in Tokyo in the morning lost more than 11%, falling to 1,668 yen per share.
The speech gene turned out to be a synapse booster.
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School found a protein that enables Foxp2's "gen of speech" to perform its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and the magazine's website can read its short contents.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known genome whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 with the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other themselves.
Scientists found that family members had been disabled by the Foxp2 gene, but how it performed its function remained unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their Foxp2 functions act as a catalyst for the formation of new synapses in the brain area associated with speech formation.
He does it through another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered by the search for factors that stimulate synapses.
SRPX2 proved to be one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, with only Foxp2 on his activity.
What SRPX2 does affect vocalization, scientists confirmed in a mouse experiment.
When the activity of the gene was artificially reduced in animals, they screamed less when separated from their mother.
If the gene activity was restored, the frequency of the sound produced was restored.
Previously, mice also showed a connection to the vocalization of Foxp2.
Animals who were injected with a human copy of the gene were fed more actively and at a lower frequency than regular mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, consequently, its SRPX2 is linked to purely “mechanical” characteristics of sound formation or more subtle processes.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned a gang leader of a police investigation is imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta passed information to criminal authority Neil Scarborough
Counsel was afraid his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A pretentious lawyer who told a drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid to expose his secret drug addiction was jailed for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Ditta gave criminal authority to Neil Scarborough secret information on the investigation of his drug trafficking activities after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer who had been nicknamed Bash and nicknamed a "cool lawyer" among criminals was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation on Scarborough, whom he had previously represented at a drug trial.
Officers observed 32-year-old Scarborough leaving three cocaine bags at a lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire County, while he was at a dinner party of a bar association with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta was "regularly using" a class A drug, after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two persons on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police supervision at that time as part of an extensive investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merciside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and more than £200,000 in cash in a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was passing information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be revealed.
Today, at the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditt, who works for the Forbes Solicitors, a law company located in Blackburn, was disgraced after being found guilty in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to possession of cocaine at one of the previous court sessions.
The lawyer's outburst occurred after the police investigating Scarborough found out that he had been on a regular phone with Ditta since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and discovered how he approached Ditt's house in Blackburn and placed 60% pure drugs in a black golf glove under a lawyer's trash box.
Shortly after the broadcast, Scarborough called numerous times with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court learned that Ditta was "regularly using" cocaine after tests found traces of Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, said he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a "lawyer's secret".
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and a hair sample was also taken from him.
During the police interview, he said that, along with the workplace, he had a home office and clients came to his house on legal matters.
However, the court learned that after important arrests, he had called the largest drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell them that detectives knew about them.
In the indictment, Anne White said, "If anyone knows they shouldn't violate the law, it's a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, as he has entered into too close a relationship with certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly be legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely exceeded the usual legal and client relationship.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible to allow these persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honour his profession, but disgraced her.
He became too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and allowed him to doubt his lack of interest.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and stated, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, whom I am not, and would like to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, I would have done so immediately."
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police stated, "Mr. Ditta has become a criminal lawyer as soon as he began acquiring drugs from organized crime."
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the main members of criminal groups who have instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and instil trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover up his profession.
Mr. Ditt's investigation was conducted by the Lancashire Specially Dangerous Organized Crime Unit, which has already reached a sentence for him in three cases of cocaine possession and now an obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire to obtain fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was convicted for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
A further 35 persons who participated in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta arranged a question-and-answer conversation in which he says that the work of his dream is a lawyer representing death-penalty clients in America, the ideal companion for him at dinner is Mohammed Ali, and motivation in work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavla is not ready to receive 22,000 spectators, and the police officers who were present at the KDC meeting of the Russian Federation today noted.
The flight programme was, in their view, roughly doubled.
During match 1/16 of the Russian Cup final with Spartacus, only a thousand stewards were involved, with a regulation of 9,000.
Spartakov fans were entitled to 2,200 seats, 10 per cent of the stadium's capacity, however, under an arrangement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5,000 tickets.
This data was made available to the head of the KDC, Arthur Grigoryantz.
Americans eavesdropped on Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, a representative of American intelligence agencies who chose not to reveal his name stated that the States had overheard telephone conversations by high-ranking Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that there are several listening points in the rising sun country.
He noted, however, that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not engage in intelligence activities against each other.
This, he said, was the case during World War II, when those countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite its allied relations with Americans in the post-war period, is an intelligence facility, reported NHK.
This information has not officially been commented on by either party.
Let's remind you, news of U.S. intelligence surveillance of the chancellor of FRG appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA could have tapped Merkel's phone for the last ten years.
The chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her wiretap very painfully.
She stated that the allies she believed were the FRG and the United States for decades, such surveillance of the head of government was unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden stated that he was prepared to share details of Angela Merkel's wiretapping with German prosecutors.
The German flew specifically to Moscow to meet with a former CIA officer.
Bashkriya can put grain on the market not before early 2014
Bashkriya, in the course of public procurement interventions, can place grain on the market no earlier than early 2014, considers the Republic's Minister of Agriculture Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not encourage sales to an intervention fund.
As long as the market price is higher, there's demand.
"Perhaps the grain will be traded after New Year's Day," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that in the current year, 3.1 million hectares of crops had been planted for the 2013 harvest, including 1.7 million hectares of cereals, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the previous year.
A total of 550,000 hectares (an increase of 105,000 hectares from 2012) were planted for the 2014 harvest.
The area under winter wheat and triticale has been increased, and the rhinos have remained stable.
There is no Brother Circle group in the M.A. databases that Leps was named to in the U.S.
The databases of Russian sylivists of the Bratsky Circle group, to which Washington listed singer Gregory Leps, are not listed.
According to Interfax of the Russian Federation's law enforcement agencies, all databases were verified after media reports of the U.S. Department of the Treasury placing Gregory Leps on control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother Circle", but no such group was found.
The dissemination of this information helps to maintain the myth of the so-called “Russian mafia”, which is allegedly operating abroad, is regarded by the security forces.
"Even in the very name is 'Brother Circle', there's some element of mystery, there's a hint of a secret bed.
"It's all very much like a public service announcement," said the agency's interlocutor.
On October 31, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that Arthur Badalian, Gregory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalski and Igor Szykov were listed on their control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate.
The individuals on this list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafour Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on the United States sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Gregory Leps "shall serve as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev".
At Gregory Leps's production center, they refused to comment on the U.S. allegations against the singer, calling them "bread."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama identified the Brother Circle Syndicate as a "significant transnational organized crime group" and instructed the Minphine to "prevent and prohibit their global criminal operations."
The blacklisting of a U.S. Minphine leads to the freezing of his assets in the United States and the prohibition of business contacts with him by persons residing in the States.
Scandal video hit the police.
Toronto's head Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and blatantly reckless antics, was caught smoking crack.
Canadian City Police stated that they had the relevant video and were ready to launch an investigation against the city chief.
He stated that he would not leave his post, reports CNN.
Information that the authorities had evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto police website.
Local law enforcement chief Bill Blair held a press conference on this subject.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share the skills with the public, but he was given responsibility for their existence.
According to Blair, a compromising Rob Ford video was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by order guards in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had previously written about the existence of the video, but until recently there had been no confirmation.
The mayor himself does not comment on this.
All he's saying is he's innocent and he's not going to resign.
A police video recording is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend, Ford Alexander Lisi, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, illegal profits, and criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Foxy served as Rob Ford's driver.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought journalists, appeared in public in a drunken manner, and allowed himself to be racist and sexist.
The USA Rostoveroinvest has recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender at the choice of the object's master designer.
The amount of the contract at Rostovaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the press service of the OAO, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, and according to the terms of the tender, the draft is to be prepared and sent to the state expert examination in spring 2014.
The winner will have to design a new airport passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and airport complex improvements.
In the first phase of construction, the interior area of the terminal will be 50,000 square metres, and it is possible to increase it in the future.
According to Rostoveroinvest, the project documents will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender was concluded, the architectural concept of the Southern Air Station complex, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects, had been defined.
The main terminal building project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Donu and other cities in the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience with major projects, the company designed terminals C and E of Sheremetimevo International Airport and a new air terminal at Knjevici International Airport in Vladivostok.
The South International Airport Complex will be built in the Aksai district of Rostov Oblast and will replace the existing growth of the airport, which will be closed and eventually integrated into urban development.
The construction of the air station complex is scheduled for 2014 and the installation of all facilities for 2017.
Politician in Turkey launched a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began construction of the separation wall in the Nusaybin area of south-east Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the PMD pro-Kurd party strongly opposed construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaibin Aishé Gekhan, on the border with Syria, declared a hunger strike protesting the construction of the separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reporting to RIA News in the Press Service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PDP) on Friday.
Police have repeatedly dispersed protest demonstrations.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muammer Güler, first denied the construction, then stated that the wall was being built to secure the borders.
"Nusaibin's mayor Aishé Gekhan, a member of the PMD, launched a hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the wall into a deadly struggle," stated the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from each other, the Kurds crossing the border freely for half a century.
"This is an inhumane situation that the Kurds will never agree with," quotes Aisha Gekhan of the party.
According to the press service, a meeting against the construction of the separation wall is planned in Nusaibin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set the rate of exchange for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, bolívara, against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on 1 November, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange sums equivalent to $10,000 a year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the country ' s bolivars at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the bolívar against the dollar will be established later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is estimated to be 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the Bolivar has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 per cent.
The Minister of Petroleum and Vice-President of Economics, Rafael Ramirez, stated on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to depreciate the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of price containment for products and commodities, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, have led to shortages of a number of products and the operation of the black exchange market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that Venezuela had a shortage of toilet paper.
Yundra director Andrei Belmach noted that it was difficult to tell how long it would take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place just a few hours ago, so to tell you how long it's gonna take to find a new coach, I'm not ready, ITAR-TASS says Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're looking into all the possibilities.
Priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I don't just want to find some coach, but someone who'll work at our club for a few years and get some results.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the provocative media law
"This is a scary place, and there is reason to ask: What can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?" the newspaper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of the Capital Group, a parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news website.
He said that the new media court "will always be biased, as it is a continuation of the government," and content and advertising restrictions would harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the government to "take over the media with a dead grip", and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "received a serious blow," and criticized the bill as "draconian".
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to enhance national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at Westgate shopping centre.
Kenya's media sparked the anger of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance footage, where troops who were sent to the scene of the attack are allegedly robbing an expensive shopping centre.
The reaction of police chief David Kimayo was to call two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was cancelled following mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishing houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists up to one million with an additional risk of being "delisted", i.e. getting a ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender ' s property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations".
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's so-called "vigorated blogosphere".
Politicians realize that by keeping the media quiet, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote National Mutuma journalist Matthew, characterizing Kenyan media as a key source of deterrence and balancing forces in public life.
"The politicians left to themselves will ruin the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to lift the cuts set by the National Wages Commission and to restore their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings per month, tax-free, one of the highest in the world.
There will be a new line of expenditure in the utility payments to the crows - a contribution for the major renovation of the house.
The most approximate estimate for a standard two-room apartment would be 100 to 400 rubles per month from the new year.
The precise standard will be determined by the Government of the region.
But when you paint the entrance, fix the stairwells, or even replace the elevator, it's up to the tenants to decide.
Such a law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Kvalnikov, Chairman of the Voronezhsky Regional Duma, said, "In this case too, order must be established - setting the order of the house repairs, accumulating funds not in the management companies - which we often have in Moscow or Orenburg or elsewhere - it will be the establishment of State control over the expenditure of funds that residents collect for the renovation of apartment buildings."
State-controlled construction is now part-time.
The law protecting against fraud has been approved by a wrap-up in final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4,500 people have been affected by dishonest developers.
Most of the problems have been solved.
By the way, the new law lays down rights and obligations for all those involved in the construction.
Vladimir Kkeynikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, stated, "It is no secret that there have also been abuses in this field, due to the fact that in the 98th year the co-ops caught the same ones, and in the 2000s the same co-payers."
People started making money to cover the loophole, including passing these two laws.
It has been decided to build a temporary stay centre for foreign nationals subject to deportation under Voronezh.
The Regional Parliament passed such a law not only under the pressure of the Federation.
The problems associated with irregular migrants in the region have been alleviated.
In the past year, for example, just over 100,000 foreigners had entered the migration register.
But only one in five issued an official work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Kkeynikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said, "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
There's no trial, and you have to deport them. You have to keep them somewhere.
The Federation has decided that such places should be established with regional funds.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is defined as Old Olshanka Semiluk district.
And lastly, the regional parliament gave new benefits to parents with many children.
First, families with 5 or more children are completely exempt from the transportation tax.
The budget loses 3.5 million, but so do parents with many children.
Second, and most importantly, those who adopt 3 or more babies will be granted housing subsidies from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 per metre.
A family of six, for example, is a father, a mother, a natural child and a 3rd adopted child.
For them, according to the regulations, the State acquires 108 square metres of housing for 3 million rubles.
For the left bank or the south-west neighbourhood, it is acceptable.
Well, you can buy a cottage for that at the center.
Baumgertner nominated for the Uralcalia Board of Directors
The current Board of Directors of the UAO Uralkaly has proposed the candidacy of the Director-General Vladislav Baumgertner, arrested in Minsk, for the new board, and is reported on the Russian company's website.
Bamgertner is on the list of 11 persons nominated to the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on 29 November, at which the new composition of the Board of Directors will be determined by vote.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
At the time of his arrest in August this year, he was charged with abuse of authority.
Later, however, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated at a press conference that Baumgertner's charges were re-characterized as "theft."
Petroleum goalkeeper Matt Dalton refused to comment on Vladimir Krikunov's departure from his position as mentor of the lowercamians.
Golkiper believes that acting head coach Dmitri Balmin has great authority with the players and will manage his duties.
Let's remind you, today, the Oilchemist retired the Crickuns.
To be honest, I don't want to comment on Vladimir Krikunov's dismissal, quotes Dalton RIA "News."
All I can say is that Dmitri Balmin will be able to live up to his obligations - I have no doubt about that.
On the team, he has great authority, and this young specialist is definitely looking forward to a great future.
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci won't help the team in Italy's next match with Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coaching staff decided not to include him in the game bid to save him for the 4th round of the Champions League's Group Round match with Real.
Nor will they compete with Parma Lichtsteiner, Vučinić and Pepe.
And Fábio Quallarella's forward recovered from the injury and is ready to play.
A tax manoeuvre that increases the mineral tax (NPPI) on oil, while reducing export duties and increasing excise, will result in fuel costs.
In the view of the experts, these measures could bring an additional 619.3 billion roubles to the budget.
The President of the Krasnoyarsk Court had his ID stolen, hitting him on the head.
The unknown attacked the president of the Krasnoyarsky Regional Court, Vladimir Dwaconko, stealing his ID.

U.S. Secretary of State: Intelligence agencies sometimes "go too far" when collecting data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that in data collection and wiretapping, American intelligence agencies sometimes "went too far," yet a politician noted that the media's information on the wiretapping of 70 million people was not true.
I assure you that innocent people have not been harmed in this process, but the attempt to gather information has been.
Yes, in some cases this went too far and was wrong.
I admit that, as the president admits... and we will make sure that it doesn't happen in the future," quotes the AFP Secretary of State.
Italian workers with seniority give way to young ones
Italian unemployment beats records.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5 per cent of the population is now unemployed.
Things haven't been so bad since World War II.
Among the young, the figure is several times higher.
40.4 per cent of the population aged 15-24 is unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is early retirement of older workers.
This experiment is already being carried out by the largest energy company in the country, and the laws enacted allow the regional authorities to provide a portion of the early retirement pension for long-term workers.
On the other hand, however, Italy is waiting for a common European problem of an ageing population.
And economists are not sure that the premature rotation of staff will justify itself.
What the construction of the TPU in Moscow will lead to
With each year, the capital authorities promise to build more transport and trans-shipment hubs (TPIs).
It is planned to put 255 TPUs into operation by 2020.
What the project actually turns out to be was handled by our correspondent.
A few months ago, a construction fence broke out at the Smolenskaya Line.
The inscription said the transport and trans-shipment hub was being built.
This was all very strange, since there is no ground transport near Smolenskaya and therefore no crossing is possible.
In order to reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, it is necessary to cross some 130 metres, including the land crossing the Pocket alley.
It's almost over at Smolenskaya's now.
The flower stand disappeared, the newspaper stand dismantled, and the asphalt before the entrance changed to a bar.
That's the whole transport hub.
Transport and trans-shipment hubs are flat and capital, as explained in the Press Service of the Metropolitan Department of Transport.
There are no capital TPUs yet.
And the flats involve parking, the removal of commercial facilities that prevent passengers from moving, the creation of small architectural forms and improvements.
In fact, it is not even transporters who do the ploughing, but professional well-being workers from the Moscow capital improvement department.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex design, explains the director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics, Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes there's enough roof over the head and a tablet to indicate the time of arrival of the transport.
For example, the Yasenevo Metro recently opened a fully-fledged flat-grave transplant node.
No overhangs, but with intercepting parking lots and tabloids indicating when the bus comes.
But in the pursuit of numbers, officials record everything in the TSP.
As early as 2011, the City Hall planned to build all 151 knots, 59 of them with capital construction.
There are now 255 TPUs in the plans until 2020.
One and a half of them promise to surrender as early as this year.
Although the city has a TPU development programme, no qualitative criteria have been identified, as noted by Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization City and Transport.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of transplants on each of them often deteriorates.
The criterion, in the expert ' s view, should be two: first, reduced time for transplants, and second, convenience.
First of all, the possibility of changing the mode of transport without going into the rain.
In Moscow, however, the construction of the TPU sometimes goes exactly the opposite way.
It's a vivid example of the "BLEEP" metro.
The suburban buses from the Yaroslav Highway used to come into the square in front of the main entrance to the OCE.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Jaroslavka to the Street of Cosmonauts.
Far from the subway, far from the monorail, but closer to the residential homes.
It's a gift that the residents absolutely didn't want a bus station under the windows and complained to all possible authorities.
Capital TPUs in Moscow didn't come at all.
The first of them started building five years ago at the Planer's Metro.
The project was designed to be exemplary.
Indeed, there was a sample of how a transplant knot given to investors turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there's bus ramps, a curtain to stay off the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
True, chemical trolleybuses Nos. 202 and 203 in Moscow's TPU were not given seats in principle.
They were pushed away from the subway as strangers.
But there are more places left to trade.
There's 32 stores alone, and there's almost everything, from zoos to auto shop.
Well, really, what if one of the bus passengers needs to buy a new car on the way?
When we build a capital TPU, somehow we always get a mall.
The situation recently reached its logical end when part of the parking lot decided to be placed in the market.
Now, on the third floor of the Planer's TSP, there's a tight trade in the floor parking areas.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech, and guards looking evil at our photographer.
The transplant node finally turned into a bazaar.
The thing is, the Planer's used to have a market, but it's been demolished.
And in the Prefecture, merchants were pitied and allowed to intercept the parking lot of the transplant hub.
Still, because of high prices, it's always empty.
The funniest thing is that the market has been demolished to build on its place... a new flat TPU.
That's the kind of rocking.
At the Kaluzhskaya subway, the distance from the subway lobby to the bus was 50 metres, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the mall, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the entire mall.
After 22 hours when it's closed, you have to go around it in the open.
However, the designs on Planer and Kaluzhskaya will soon appear to be flowers.
In mid-September, the City and Land Commission of the City approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25-story, excluding two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow by the Tuscino Metro, it will have 418.7 thousand square metres of space.
Representatives of the RZD railway station manager responsible for the construction of TPUs by the subway have already told journalists: future multi-storeys will house shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials assure that multi-tiered parking lots are huty from a third to half of the square.
Take the example of "people's" garages.
Let's say the 258-car garage that was recently built on International Street has an area of 8,015 square metres.
So it'll take about 80,000 squares to park 2,600 cars at Petrovski-Rasumovsky.
That's less than a third of the machina that's going to be built there.
Let's have one or two floors go to the bus ramps.
There are at least 150,000 square metres of commercial real estate left.
And this, for a minute, is almost two GUMs.
If the capital TPUs at stations and stations are built by rail, the rest of the sites will be developed by metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many "functional objects", including hotels, offices, and even gymnasiums.
By the way, the Moscow Property Department recently told journalists that a draft decree was being drafted that would allow investors to apply directly to officials for the TSP site.
No contests.
That's why transport is a priority for the city.
The perfect TPU is, for example, a Harvard station in Boston or a Spadaina station in Toronto, I'm sure Alexander Morozov.
There the trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the subway level and the distance from the subway car to the tram is only 50 metres from the street.
There's no need to trade around here.
But Moscow's officials are being pushed to the extreme.
Either we don't build anything, or we're gonna kill 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremism.
For the legislative protection of the patriotic feelings of citizens against provocations and insults directed against Russia, Fair Russia proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to punish them for five years in prison.
According to Newspaper, such legislative amendments, prepared by the Deputy Prime Minister of the Duma Energy Committee, Oleg Miheev, have already been sent to obtain an opinion from the Supreme Court and the Government.
By the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional relationship of a person to a country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for that country, responsible attitude to her fate, respect for her history and culture.
As Miheev points out, domestic legislation sanctions the abuse of official State authority, the flag and the coat of arms.
However, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be hurt by the insult of State symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, is not sufficiently elaborated in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the annual debate on the eve of Victory Day, when some media personalities allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the struggle against the fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday, Victory Day 9 May, real Vacchanalia unfolds every year.
While exercising in wit and "alternative view" of history, some publicists come to the point that it is a pity that cultural Germans have not conquered the wild Soviet Union!
I find this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main "spiritual bond" of the nation," Oleg Miheev resents.
Moreover, according to Miheev, there are many more patriotic people in Russia than religious ones, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and insulting patriotic feelings can be practically tolerated.
In the opinion of the popular elected person, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to prescribe appropriate penalties in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for penalties for insulting patriotic feelings, ranging from a fine of 100,000 to 5 years ' imprisonment.
The magnitude 6.6 earthquake occurred on Thursday, October 31, in the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, transmitting the Reuters agency.
The earthquake was in the ocean 10.7 kilometres deep and 54 kilometres south-west of the city, as explained on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The thrusts were recorded at 8:03 a.m. local time (3:03 a.m. on November 1, Moscow).
No casualties or damage caused by underground shocks have yet been reported.
Let us recall that Chile is in one of the most seismic areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of varying intensity are not uncommon.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
At that time, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake and the tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960, it recorded a magnitude of 9.5.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case to be dealt with fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev reported on Friday that Greenpeace activists' case would be considered in strict compliance with Russian law.
France can be certain that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, and we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee adherence to the laws," said Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
There is a French citizen among the detained Greenpeace activists.
Pierre Pizan, like other activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quotes Mr. Ero's RIA News.
“Our country cannot support activities that may harm the environment, no one may violate the law”, Dmitry Medvedev said.
He said that the activities of any entity that tried to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy extraction, were dangerous.
He stressed that these objects "as a gunpowder barrel", and recalled what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico, transmits "RIA News".
The UN declares new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin to work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty around the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro the previous night.
They were included in the outcome document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit participants the previous night that it was time to "be ahead of national interests."
"I am glad that the UN member countries have agreed to launch and control the process of creating the universal sustainable development goals, the SDGs," he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will spare no effort to use the powers vested in me by member countries to translate our vision of sustainable development, which is based on the successful achievement of the MDGs.
The security concerns in Mozambique are heightened by the conflict of influential people
Under the looking down statue of Zamora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to chant slogans of peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt decorated with the inscription "We demand security" on Portuguese, and joined a crowd on Thursday on the Metropolitan Independence Square.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports of clashes between Government forces and Renamo — one of the most violent clashes since the armistice was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa of the apartheid era as part of an effort to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the 1992 armistice, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide back into full-scale conflict, but recent events have made foreign investors and local residents nervous.
The stakes are high for a rapidly growing economy, as the discovery of huge shelf gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest may attract more than $50 billion as investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy, and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo Party, a leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo Party accuse each other of having created tensions.
Renamo's party claims that the government has become the instigator of the latest clashes, attacking its members in Sofala Province, the traditional Renamo stronghold, on 17 October.
Attacks on former insurgents then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group leader, reported to the Financial Times newspaper Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman.
The government blames Renamo for initiating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armandu Gebuza tried to dispel fears of instability.
Gebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt like a "lost man" who wanted to use "all that was left of his powers to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears increased following reports that Mazanga had declared Renamo's rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He reported to the Financial Times that he meant non-compliance with the agreement by the Frelimo Party.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
"These are two influential men (Gebuza and Dhlakam) collided with foreheads," said Joseph Hanlon, an open university lecturer and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo's party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The proportion of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), which is founded by former Renamo member, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who was due to resign next year when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is not clear what the potential of Renamo is, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key north-south highway.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala Province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beiro, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railway tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened an attack on the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked whether Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo’s party wanted “to warn the international community that things are not going very well in Mozambique”, Mazanga said.
Instability has increased the Government’s dissatisfaction, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent increase in kidnapping, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent Mediacoop.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the Government and the President, who must find a solution to these problems," he says.
Omar Sultan, a demonstration participant, said that people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace to resume, they want free access to roads," he said.
The Art Mainstream premiere series will take place in Moscow.
The Art Mainstream film series, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will take place at the Roland cinema from 1 to 5 November, reports RIA News, citing the organizers of the project.
The Art Mainstream program will be opened by French comedy director and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at all costs".
This is the story of the French capital model Maié (sama Kerichi), who is being deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, the audience will also be shown a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Dook "Mebius", the melodramatic Bayopic Oliver Hirschbigeel "Dian: The Story of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts starring and the main film of the May Cannes Film Festival "Adel's Life" by Abdalatif Keshish.
The only Russian member of Art Mainstream will be the winner of the film Alexander Veledinsky's "Geograph Globe saw" on the basis of Alexey Ivanov's novel of the same name.
The main role - the charming teacher Victor Slujkin - was played in the film by Constantine Habensky, whose work was also marked by the Kinotatra prize.
Children should study myths and legends as "models of way of life," says the author.
The account of the Torah could show that "gross power cannot defeat sophisticated cunning", and legends about King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
In saying that many myths will be "too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too indecent for teaching in schools", Crossley-Holland advocates "a thorough selection" of age-appropriate texts.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I advocated their introduction to the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that the "excessive morality" of authors and teachers "rejects interest" in children, and the main ideas "sublimated" into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote "Synopsis of Norwegian Myths" for Penguin publishing and "British Folk Tales", said, "You may have intentions, of course, but you better keep them to yourself."
Perhaps a great difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but that there should be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And that should be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly articulated.
The old principle is to show, not tell.
In Voronezh region, a football fan is detained breaking a window in the waiting room of the station.
At 9 p.m. on 29 October, at the Gräzy-Voronezha station, transport police officers removed two football fans, native to the Moscow region, from the passenger train.
After going to the team's favorite game, the guys on the way threw a drunken deboss on the train.
Young people were taken to the duty section of the Line Police Station at the Gräzy Station to draft a protocol on an administrative offence.
There the fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police officers issued administrative material to them and released them.
Young people bought tickets to the next train and waited at the station station for his arrival.
In the middle of the first night, fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and his foot broke the front door window in the station waiting room.
A transport police officer and a security guard of the RDZ were on the sound of a broken glass.
They were able to apprehend an intruder who had tried to escape the scene.
The staff of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation ' s South-East L.O.L. are subject to verification.
The question of the initiation of criminal proceedings is under consideration and was reported by the senior director of information and public relations of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in connection with the transport of Sergei Olkhovik.
Vitaly Mutko: Waterhouses?
I think we're 15 years back.
Sport Minister Vitaly Mutko gave his opinion on the riots at the podiums during the Russia Cup match Shinnik - Spartacus.
I'm in favour of having sports organizers take responsibility for all of this: clubs, leagues, RSFs.
But we can see that they've taken a dreary position.
They're waiting for someone to come and clean up.
That's a very good position, but not quite right.
We have to organize fans, clubs have to invite their stewards, not let things run their course.
We've now drawn up a special government regulation on the rules of the stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will deal with the problem closely.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedoun's interview.
State, let's fast-track the law.
It's like those Bavaria fans came to Yaroslavl and they all set it up.
We're outside observers.
In fact, it's terrible to see a stand being watered from a firewall.
And that's in a country that's preparing for the World Cup.
"I feel like we're back 10-15 years ago," Mutko said.
Snowden can be questioned in Russia
An ex-American intelligence officer, Edward Snowden, is likely not to travel outside Russia to testify in the wiretapping cases of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.
According to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, an American can answer questions from the German Attorney General's Office in writing or in Russian.
Edward Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he would lose refugee status and could be extradited to Washington by countries allied to the United States," said an agency interviewee.
"In principle, however, the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federal Republic of Germany could send representatives to the Russian Federation or hand over written questions to Snowden," added the source, adding that the matter should be dealt with at the inter-State level.
Formerly German Bundestag member Hans-Christian Strebele reported that Edward Snowden was willing to testify in a wiretapping case by the American intelligence services of the German Chancellor of Negotiations.
Snowden is willing to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or on German territory.
An ex-C.I.A. officer made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the U.S. NSA blocking all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
To do so, however, all the conditions for his arrival must be clearly defined," told Strabela to Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the Interfax source's statement, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information about secret U.S. surveillance operations on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the U.S. authorities, who had charged him in absentia with serious charges, and remained in the transit zone of Sherememievo Airport until early August.
On 1 August, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russian territory for a period of one year and left Sherememievo on the same day.
Yesterday, an American lawyer, Anatoly Kucheren, stated that his client had taken a job with a "large Russian company".
The NSA's surveillance of Angela Merkel last week was reported by German media.
According to journalists, the chancellor's phone calls began to be tapped by Americans as early as 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly located at the United States Embassy in Berlin.
Following the publication of this information, the German authorities stated that the surveillance of Merkel violated German law and sovereignty.
Ponomarev left Fair Russia
State Duma deputy from the Party of Fair Russia, a member of its branch in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomarev, filed an application for withdrawal from a political organization.
According to a parliamentarian, he applied to the party's New Siberian Regional Office.
According to her charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of the "justicedresses."
We're sitting here drinking tea...
"For some reason, many want to see the painting "Ilia Ponomarev puts on the table party," but there's nothing so epochal about it," the MP commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintained a good relationship with the regional esers office.
However, Ilya Ponomarev, a member of the State Duma, does not intend to give up his mandate.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remained a member of the faction and was legally unable to leave it.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave the Fair Russia party appeared on October 30.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov would come with him, but the latter soon denied the information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese MIDA Fumio Kisida met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“We would like to have a frank exchange of views on the further development of the political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty”, Kisid said at the meeting.
The Foreign Minister of Japan recalled that after Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between countries had become warmer and bilateral.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation would meet Japan on complex political issues, writing RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies the resolution of the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
To that end, there are today protests in Tokyo to demand the return of the land lost since World War II.
There are cars driving through the Japanese capital, from which the loudspeaker is told, "Return the northern territories!"
Police don't stop protesters, they make sure the noise doesn't go out.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be said boldly that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, entertainer Frank Faye, who worked as a conference artist at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a talkative manner.
Faye's innovation has eventually been picked up by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hersch, founder of the Carolinas stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started in Carolinas, and then achieved greater success, reached a level where they were already too famous to compete in the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the performances of Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mar, as well as Stendap for Heroes, an annual music and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be among the others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy also expanded.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year gained popularity in an unconventional way, for example through shows on small television channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was famous for his role in the comedy series on a little-known cable television channel (the "League" on FXX on fantasy football), and now hosts his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the cast both at Saturday night live and at Parks and Recreation Areas, although she is best known for the series of "Marsell - shell in boots" viral videos.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with a unique style (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a treacherous, race-focused Camau Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival's brightest moments will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but then became a successful director on television and in film, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is certainly the central element of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks on some street between the two houses and thinks, "Here's if I'm left with no money at all, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities have initiated talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the British Embassy, where Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British vice-premier Nick Klegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister reported that the dialogue with the Taliban had begun, as stated in a statement by the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
He said he hoped and prayed that the dialogue would work in accordance with Pakistan's constitution," added diplomats.
The Pakistani Taliban (Techrik-e-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently of them in the north-west of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the establishment of an Islamic State.
The Islamabad Government had previously attempted to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement had refused to engage in dialogue.
It stated that it would only negotiate if the authorities took troops stationed in areas where the Taliban were active to permanent locations and released arrested Islamists from prison.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns over the creation of large stocks overshadowed a message showing that China’s energy-intensive production sector is gaining momentum.
The standard US oil in December's supply lost 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel later in the morning of European time in electronic bidding at the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract increased by 39 cents, the sum of which was a 5.8 per cent drop in the October price.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy stated on Wednesday that US stocks had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels have been replenished.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, based on two reports of Chinese industry showing a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China's recovery may continue to gain momentum after growth in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after a 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Brent's oil, a reference type of international oil used also by United States refineries, has lost 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
The head coach of Colorado, Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the goalkeeper Semen Varlamov from the first minute of Friday's match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, conveys from Dallas a co-cor to Natalia Schmelev.
And what are we waiting for,' said Rua after the morning run of Lavin.
Of course, we are all concerned about what happened, but we are confident of it and feel that it will be good for him to get out on the ice today.
We want him to go out to the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure the situation didn't affect the goalkeeper's condition?
We'll see today.
No doubt our players will support Varley by helping him guard the gate, as was the case in previous matches of this season.
The main thing is that no one on the team is going to make any conclusions until the court has dealt with this situation.
There's no need to be a vegan in Siberia: greenhouse tomato doesn't replace soup.
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for living in Siberia, was asked by RIA News correspondent.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they cannot endure the winter without loss of health, and no greenhouse tomatoes compensate for them, believe vegan day before vegan's New Siberian dieters and doctors.
Drinking Litres
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, diet doctors are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia it is at least not healthy to adhere to such strict dietary standards.
The complete abandonment of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain indispensable amino acids that are very difficult to compensate for by plant proteins.
You have to put at least milk or eggs in the diet," I'm sure nutritionist Marina Bogey.
She cites fish containing the indispensable Omega-3 fatty acid.
Its richest vegetable oil is linen oil.
"To consume it in the quantities necessary for a person, you need to drink litres!" says a nutritionist.
Medics are convinced that Siberians need to pay special attention to their diet during the winter.
Vegetarianism is particularly questioned this season.
In our realities, there are high demands on food.
To stay warm, you need increased caloricity.
"If a person limits himself to animal products, accordingly, he does not get that calorie," says the specialist.
Olga Pozniak, a dietologist, agrees.
She adds that bringing vegetables and fruit is not an option.
It is better for a person to eat mainly food that is grown in the region or where he was born.
The genetic code is set to better absorb and digest these products.
And in the winter, people don't want to eat pickles, they want to eat hot soup or something wetter," the doctor explains his position.
According to her, of what can eat vegans, various grains, croupes, beans, local vegetables, apples remaining in the winter, frozen berries are truly useful.
But it's certainly not enough to feed enough.
According to the gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians only had enough vitamins in their bodies from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh environmental conditions, when temperatures can change by 30 degrees in a 24-hour period and snow is laid in May, is inconvenient.
The body needs energy for life, and that's, above all, fat," says the medic.
Doctors note that veganism is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And in keeping with vegetarianism, we give them inferior.
Pregnant women also need increased levels of protein, vitamins and micronutrients in the menu.
"Veganks miss them," I'm sure God will.
Arifulina says a grown man is free to choose anything to "play those toys he wants."
He has an already formed body, a skeleton, organs.
And yet, children must be well fed.
If parents deprive him of any micronutrients or amino acids by choosing what he will eat for him, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of any kind of substance for brain development, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow," she says.
All the medical experts interviewed agree on the low quality of winter grown in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains less of the micronutrients we need than (bred) in the open.
"The quality of the products is wrong," says God.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the willingness of producers to harvest more crops is detrimental to quality.
"Apples don't get brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly yellow and mold, tomatoes tasteless and nearomatic," cites medical examples, adding that they are likely to be filled with excess fertilizer.
And they're not the suppliers of vitamins, they're the cellulars.
The Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology Institute of Agrarian Problems, candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk, disagrees with this.
She says that, with the right approach and respect for all standards and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full-blown vegetables.
If you try to drive out more from a square metre, of course, you'll be able to water more, and you'll be able to feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow rapidly, they are large but watery and unsweet," she explains, adding that quality is primarily a matter of conscience for the producer.
The Court suspended execution of the decision on the “stop-and-search” practice in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeal suspended execution of a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's “stop-and-search” program, and suspended the judge from the case.
The United States Second Circuit Court of Appeal stated that the execution of Judge Sheera Scheindin's decisions would be suspended pending the outcome of an appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the town had violated the Constitution in the way he carried out the street detention and interrogation programme.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and corrective orders, including an order to appoint a supervisor to help the police office change the practice and the training programme associated with it.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a hearing by the parties on the motion to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be challenged because it had violated the U.S. Code of Conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid showing bias, partly due to a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to court criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unduly addressing blacks and Hispanics on a “stop-and-search” programme.
It had appointed an external monitor to oversee major changes that included policy, training and monitoring reforms, and had decided to launch a pilot programme to test video cameras in police stations where most of the arrests took place.
In August, New York decided to discontinue the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases had been discontinued after police checks.
A debate on the city ' s appeal is due to take place after March 14, 2014.
The "stop and search" tactics were criticized by numerous civil rights lawyers.
Stop-search has been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of which are black and Latin American.
In 2004, four persons, all members of national minorities, filed a collective lawsuit in court.
Supporters of changes to the “stop-and-search” programme in the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to unfair practices, create a more robust and effective police service and may influence the way other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that changes will reduce police morale rather than crime, result in unnecessary spending of money, and will not solve a more global problem of difficult police conditions due to a reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not stop the practice of “decease-and-search”, which was consistent with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York Police stopped people.
In the area of the Tretakovsky Gallery, a pedestrian area was opened
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretakovsky Gallery and occupies a section two kilometres from the Novakuznetskaya subway station to the Bolotna Square.
Street Torsers, flowerers, benches, urns and toilets, deaf fences and illegal advertising are all installed throughout.
In addition to the Clementovsky and Lavrushin alleys, which were already pedestrian, five streets - Ordinsky dead end, Grand and Little Tolmachevi alleys, Kadashevsky Waterfront and Swamp Square - closed for cars.
Traffic on the streets of Maroseik and Petrovka is not restricted.
On Friday Street section from the lobby of Novokuznetskaya Station to the Clementov alley, pedestrian conditions were created without removing traffic and cutting the carriageway, transmitting newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian area was the Tretkov Gallery, the temple of Clement's priest Pope, a museum, libraries, monuments, and other landmarks.
Previously, the Tver Passage, the Poles of the alleys and Kuznetsky Bridge Street were entirely pedestrian.
The large Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian area opened in early September, decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson hacked the phone to check the confidential message.
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "a phone break, surveillance, and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm false information about Charles Clark's novel, who was then Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor, Queen's Counsel Andrew Edis informed the Old Bailey Court that in May 2005 News of the World received false news that Clark was meeting with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulkeir to hack Paulby's voice mail and watch her outside the house for an interview, but Coulson also called her and left voicemails,” heard the court.
"The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand by someone's house, hoping to catch someone by surprise, he is the person who likes to offer history to people to see what they will say," said Mr. Edice.
He said the News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the cell phone hack?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yeah!"
Rumors of Clark's novel first caught the attention of the News of the World editorial when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
A tape containing voice messages received from her phone at least three times was removed from Mulkeir's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private detective's computer that featured Ms. Polby and her sister as "Projects".
During the period she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby ' s grandparents received anonymous calls requesting information about her, said Mr. Edice.
At that time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Wezerap monitored Ms. Polby's movements.
Leaving her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and which I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edice said Coulson's involvement in the story was the same as that of other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blanket about an affair with a married woman while he himself met with corresponding Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with other people to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkeir, Turlbeck, and Wezerap confessed to hacking phones.
Snowden states that he is ready to talk to the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany in the wiretapping case.
An ex-CIA officer, Edward Snowden, expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany, transmits RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA officer to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestag MP Hans-Christian Strebel, through which Snowden conveyed the message to the German authorities.
Strebel met Snowden the previous day in Moscow.
Four people were injured in a fire on Tver Street
Four passers-by were injured as a result of a fire in a reservoir in central Moscow, Tver Street.
According to Interfax, citing a source in emergency services, one of the victims has been hospitalized.
According to the source, passers-by were injured during a fire in a smoked underground crossing.
According to RIA News citing Paul Livinsky, the head of the Metropolitan Department of Fuel and Energy, electricity is now completely restored in all homes on Tver Street.
The fire at the heat collector near 15 on Tver Street took place on the evening of 31 October.
There was heavy smoke coming out of the storm drain hatches, and the underground crossing at the Armania store was smoked.
Eleven houses on Tver Street were decommissioned as a result of the fire.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was eliminated.
The US cuts food aid to the poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday, the U.S. food stamps known as “foodstamps” have been reduced by the end of the relevant government program.
The food allowance for a family of four will now be allocated $36 per month less than previously, spoken by officials.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in fiscal year 2012 the benefit per person averaged $133 per month.
Food aid spending in the United States has increased to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14% of Americans rely on free food aid issued through foodstamps, which has been called since they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress demand further cuts in the funds allocated to the programme, stating that it should be targeted at those who need it most.
Food store owners across America are concerned that cuts will reduce consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to debate how to further reduce government funding.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platformer free of charge
Blizzard's studio released its 1994 Blackhorne platform on PC free of charge.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game became available on Battle.net in the Blitzard section of classic games.
However, some gamers note that only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service are currently able to download it.
The game is also not available to Russian users.
As broadcast by the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC is no different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackhorne also remained unchanged.
Blackthorne's platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
One day, dark ruler Sarlack decided to kill the bright King of Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The game's main hero is Vlaros' son Kyle, who was rescued from death by being sent to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight Sarlak's minions and protect the planet's inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorn was the first game the studio released after its renaming as Blizzard Entertainment.
It was formerly called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorn's publisher was Interplay.
There will be new machines on the Moscow Metro.
But selling tickets to passengers isn't for money, it's for sitting down.
One 30 ruble trip will cost a potential passenger 30 seats.
The number of sittings will count the special device using modern technologies, ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first vehicle will be installed at Exhibition Station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of the new ticket sports, the Russian Olympic Committee president Alexander Zhukov and Olympic gymnast champions Alexey Nemov and Elena Załočíčíčíčík will take part in the presentation of the new ticket sports.
National Security Agency confessions reinforce corporate paranoia with regard to government surveillance
On a warm afternoon in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
According to instructions from the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, his task was to photograph the roof of the United States Mission building, which is less than 5 kilometres from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media say that BfV hoped to find antennas of listening devices, which led to talks between the US and the German Foreign Office in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, assured again in September that the United States was not using foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the commercial secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became a whistleblower, has begun to publish his treasure of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company executives are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted at his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency followed the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored from U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised corporate paranoia caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had probably been tapped for about ten years.
If Europe’s most influential person can be targeted, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made evident intensive cooperation between US intelligence agencies and companies.
I think it's quite likely that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grun, president of BITMi's association, which represents German small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the US now presents almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
All the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, still did not show that the United States had passed on the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain information technology and Internet capabilities and felt that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we have to create German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"It's not an option," says Gasso Plattner, president of a German software company for SAP business.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
All but IT industry.
And yet the reach and technical development of US spy agencies, made known by Snowden's revelations, shocked some companies that used to think China was the biggest surveillance risk.
The big shift takes place in cloud technologies, where European company managers have become more aware that data stored in the US are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by Cloud Security Alliance's trade association, about 10 percent of its non-United States participants abandoned plans to use a cloud service provider in the United States after exposing the American program for intellectual analysis of Prism's data.
Jim Sneib, one of the executive directors of SAP, said, "We see consumers asking a new question that didn't arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction."
Many German leaders claim that the latest reports are merely proof of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most precious secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
What economic espionage is going on is not surprising.
It always happened.
"This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy," says Kurt Bock, Chief Executive Officer of the BASF Chemical Company.
The Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we spy on them, too, because it is part of our national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to brag about the responses they have taken, as this may give an advantage to the opponent.
Large companies have long learned that taking a free flash drive at the exhibition or leaving the laptop unattended in the hotel room is at least indiscreet.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi automotive company, says it has been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German Federal Constitutional Protection Service recommends that company managers consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during overseas travel due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their particular niche.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access," warns in the BfV report.
The US warns its own companies of economic espionage from other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Report in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second series of violators who hack for economic intelligence, after China, claims The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French DCRI Internal Intelligence Agency, reportedly stated in an interview this month: "The Service knows very well that all countries, even when cooperating in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a teenager in Georgia who died on "a ridiculous accident" believe their son was murdered.
The parents of a teenager from Georgia whose body was found inside a rolled-up sports mat in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, stated the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Waldosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertically standing mate, attached from behind to the podiums in his high school gym.
Investigators at the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office concluded that Johnson had died by tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old disputed it.
"They are absolutely sure their son was killed," said FoxNews.com Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff says he did.
"They think it contradicts logic, the laws of physics, and common sense," Krump said.
They think it's a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag," he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was his death the result of the crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll look into all the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to know the truth.
"I hold the view that there are sufficient grounds" for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the primary autopsy revealed that Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxiation".
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
"There are a few questions that should be resolved or clarified," he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to require a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The Lawndes County Sheriff's Office spokesman was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
On Wednesday, Judge South Georgia ordered the authorities to publish all video recordings of the security cameras that the investigators were looking at.
Teenager's parents said they hoped the videos contained the key to finding out how he died.
Spartacus: For information on persons who displayed fascist symbols
On the official website of Spartacus, the Moscow club announced the appearance of a fascist flag on the podium in Yaroslavla.
"At the Shinnik Cup Game - Spartacus on October 30, unknown provocateurs at the stadium in Yaroslavl demonstrated fascist symbols.
We ask all those who have reliable information about the perpetrators of this criminal offence to provide it
"Remuneration guaranteed," says the application.
We're looking for fans who posted a fascist flag in Yaroslavl.
Let us recall that in match 1/16 of the Russian Cup final "Shinnik" - "Spartak" was interrupted several times due to riots on the podiums.
The Spartacus fan sector also featured fascist symbols.
As a punishment, Spartacus can play around three games without an audience.
There will be a meeting of the committee on Friday.
If you have any information about who leaked and posted this symbol, please contact us.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on children's allergies
On Wednesday, the disease control and prevention centres published a list of recommendations for the control of children ' s nutritional allergies in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now, one of the 20 kids in the United States has food allergies.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the incidence of food allergies among children increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The manual provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and service staff of food allergies in children and how to help in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep stocks of adrenaline — most commonly used for injections by the automatic medical syringe EpiPen — to assist with potentially lethal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently amended the regulations to allow schools to make adrenaline supplies with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "it feels like something's sticking into my tongue," "it feels like I have hair in my tongue" or "the language stings."
Parents of intersex children can choose “uncertain sex”
Germany was the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with intermediate sexual organs.
Newborns will no longer necessarily be credited with male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any sex of such children, allowing parents to indicate sex as “uncertain” or “uncertain” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to relieve pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions on the sex-abortion operation and to counteract discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said many years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'll remain a doctor-made piece of art with bruises and scars.
Approximately one in 2,000 children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of some 60 pathological states that are diagnosed with "sexual development violations" is a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or semen) or unusually developed external sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that if gender cannot be defined, it is better to use and assign all available information than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said that the new German law "sounds like a good idea."
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening violations that require prompt intervention, but most children don't have them," he said.
You can assign a floor without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are gay.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as distinct from transgender or transgender people, as their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to the male or female sex, but is typical of both at the same time or is not characteristic of either of them.
These characteristics can be found in secondary sex traits such as muscle mass, hair cover distribution, breast and buildage; primary sex traits such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in chromosome and hormone structures.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and crimes based on prejudice.
Boys with gender bias now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to place the male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, was the world's first person to be recognized as “sexless”, defending in court the right to maintain “uncertain” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third designation in addition to M and F - X, i.e. intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a newscast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators from this prominent Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that "in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state where gender is the object of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization."
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have children set sex at birth.
"Raising a child is hard enough and without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she said to a website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, by the name of a beautiful Greek god who had signs of both sexes.
And just a decade ago, the medical community perceived gender as a leaf on which to erase everything and then draw it again.
But now many are challenging the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how a child will perceive the sex assigned to him when he grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "an urgent psychiatric case," Dresher said.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist — you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with intermediate-type genitals was proposed by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily changeable.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social – the way parents raise a child – interact with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during the negligent circumcision, to castrate the child completely, removing his testicles as well, and to raise him as a girl.
"Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it wasn't," Dresher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Dresher said that now some doctors are still "applying to this model."
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these sex-shifting operations claimed themselves to be "dissatisfied with the result."
This was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes of XY, but intermediate-type genitals.
The doctors could not determine exactly whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a "full life" of a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external sex organ and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was assigned vaginoplasty.
But when he was depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out was awful.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual developmental disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone to develop his genitals normally.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, receiving shots of testosterone and removing his chest.
The surgery made him barren.
Today, he defends others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexity.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California Law Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law "encourages labeling and stigma".
"Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make hasty decisions and give the child an 'uncertain sex'," she said.
We're afraid he'll help me intervene.
We think it's better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to make third-sex choices".
" Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender," she says.
German law implies appropriation at birth.
It is a battle that little children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammologist-rentgenologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with sexual developmental disabilities and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that German law would "support" both parents and children.
The daughter of Baratz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called "the syndrome of total insensitive to androgens".
Since her androgenic receptors are not working correctly, Katie has developed female signs.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now, at 29, Katie is married and holds a residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves," Baratz said.
He gives them time to do some tests and to understand the situation, as well as the length of time before they write "male" or "female".
In that case, you are fine — raise the child, love the child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that drives parents because they don't feel they're doing the right thing," she said.
Eventually, the child will decide with what sex he or she is more comfortable with — and that is wonderful.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Habibulin stressed that he understood that he had to play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard on training.
In the last two Hawks meetings, Habibulin first missed six pucks from Tampa Bay and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missing puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I haven't done it, quotes CSNChicago saying Habibulin.
- I need to find some confidence in the exercise, so I should probably look at them like games and try to get a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel pretty decent in training.
But somehow, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The goalkeepers -- I don't think I'm that alone -- always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself not to miss so much puck.
It's great that my one-clubs are supportive, but in principle, it's simple: I have to play better.
Two games isn't the whole season, but I wanted to spend them much better.
But it happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'll just try to play the next match better.
There's a bus on Altai.
In the Rubtsovsky district of Altai Kray, a PAZ bus was turned over.
As a result of the accidents, 13 people were reported to the MES Regional Office, according to the updated data.
Previously, 10 victims had been reported by law enforcement agencies in the region.
According to the agency, the accident occurred at around 9 a.m. local time on the Novonikolaevka - Vishnevka road, one kilometre from Novonikolaevka.
There were 12 passengers and a driver on the bus from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, all of whom suffered injuries of varying degrees of gravity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were taken to Rubtsovsk City Hospital No. 1, and two persons were hospitalized at Rubtsovska CRS.
Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 aircraft to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that, once established in Latin America and Asia markets, Superjet 100 aircraft will also be delivered to Europe.
"We expect a total of more than 170 aircraft of this type to receive such arrangements," quotes "Interfax" the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a press conference with French Premier Jean-Marc Eiro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that there was serious cooperation with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once the aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope it will ever be delivered to France," said the Russian Premier.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by Civil Dry Aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the 100 passenger seats segment.
Dnipropetrovsk power started a unique program to save... the storks of the storks.
In ancient times, to bring the storks to the court, the villagers on the high pole mounted a wheel from the cart, and the heavy nest was well kept on it.
Such special pillars have long been abandoned, so the storks have loved the poles of the power lines, the interlocking branches rely on the wires, making the austic house secure.
Anja's grandmother, whose home in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikovsky District, has been inhabited by a true family for 20 years, began to notice the nest settling despite the best efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new twigs on top, and the bottom layer is already in between the wires, it's about to collapse.
Of course, it's a pity to have a family of storks nested at a stall every year, brought out and fed three or four chicks in the summer, but I don't want to be left without light.
As the birds flew to the warmer parts, Grandma Anya called the Tsarician REC, which belongs to the support.
I didn't even expect that they'd react so quickly.
When our experts arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, as DTEC's technical director, Dneproblenergo, Sergei Berezovsky, told us.
The wires, which were in fact already inside a nest weighing 150 to 200 kilograms, began to corrode.
At any moment, the birds could have died of electric shock.
And the locals risked being out of light because of the wire damage.
So the line mounts started a nest rescue operation, not for the first time in our practice.
An ornithology scientist from Dnipropetra National University helped develop a nest transfer scheme.
They also conducted training sessions for district network staff.
The famous Ddopropetrovsky ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised energyists at all stages of the redevelopment of the nests.
For starters, it has been estimated that there are more than 50 authentic "housings" in the region in a state of emergency.
Special metal platforms similar to the funnel were welded to reconstruct them.
The foundation was soaked with willow branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to scholars, it is enough to lay the old branches as a basis for birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
Then the storks themselves will finish their own dwelling.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Sandschanka, Novomoskovsky District.
A new concrete pole was placed next to the electric pole and a platform with an old, already inhabited nest was placed on it.
The entire operation cost nine thousand hryvnias of energy.
And the other day, the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikovsky District, at the behest of Grandma Ani.
This is where the platform was fixed to its original location, but it was only lifted over the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their “housing” has been overhauled.
By the end of the year, four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsariccan districts of Dnipropetrovsky are awaiting the same reconstruction.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others kill them ruthlessly.
The last day, the whole area was covered by sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolic District, the day the pheasant hunt was opened, poachers shot down a swan family living on a local pond for entertainment.
The noble birds were not at all afraid of the people, but the locals fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers, when they heard the shots, ran to the pond, four beautiful lions were already lying dead on the water.
The Apostolic Police Department is now investigating who shot the birds listed in the Red Book.
The Russian March is getting more popular.
On November 4, People's Unity Day, Moscow will be held as agreed with the City Hall of the Russian March.
According to the Levada Centre survey, support for the Russian marches is increasing - 40 per cent of citizens have to varying degrees endorsed the idea of holding them.
According to the Levada Centre, 40 per cent of citizens approve the Russian Marches to varying degrees, 11 per cent of whom are definitely positive and 29 per cent “promptly positive”.
The popularity of the idea of the Russian marches is gradually increasing - in 2006 only 14 per cent of Russians welcomed these actions, and in December 2010 twice as many (28 per cent) of citizens supported them.
Only 7% of Russians are "specifically negative" and 19% "mostly negative" are "Russian marches".
Another 35 per cent were unable to articulate their attitude towards this action.
This year, Moscow City has agreed to hold a "Russian March" of up to 15,000 in Lublino, which was reported today by the head of the security department of the capital Alexey Majoorov.
This nationalist action has taken place every year on People's Unity Day since 2005.
When asked by sociologists, "Did you hear that Russian marches are held in Russia on November 4 under the slogans of protecting Russian rights in Russia?" three quarters (75%) of citizens replied negatively.
Only one in five Russians (20 per cent) know about this action.
Significantly, in December 2010, almost one third of citizens (31 per cent) were heard about the Russian Marches.
It will be recalled that three years ago, on 11 December, an elemental rally of nationalists took place in Manezhny Square, which turned into mass riots.
Levada Center also asked Russians about the November 4 celebration.
In two years, the number of people who know the correct answer (People's Unity Day) increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15 per cent of citizens attend the celebration.
About the same amount (17%) intend to celebrate November 7th of the October Revolution.
Most citizens (62 per cent) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How Moscow City has agreed to the "Russian March" in Lublino
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the "Russian March" on 4 November in Lublineau.
This was reported by the leader of the Russians, the organizer of the Dmitri Demushkin March.
In addition to the Lublino march on People's Unity Day, there will be a rally and a rock concert of the "Colovrat" group, also agreed with the authorities.
How did the Russian March 2012 go?
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, the nationalists marched from the Yakimana Waterfront to the Central House of Artists, where a rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20,000, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs referred to the figure of 6,000.
Message: Obama's campaign staff considered Biden's exclusion in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the closest advisors to President Barack Obama were secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This discovery is the brightest sensation of everyone's expected book Mark Halperin and John Hailemann on the 2012 campaign "The Stacks Doubled: The Game Changed 2012".
The Times edition received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the president's closest aides had conducted "large-scale research in focus groups and public opinion polls in late 2011" to assess whether Biden's exclusion could help raise the waning hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to political columnist The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by senior election staff and White House officials, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daily, to assess the impact of the election of former Secretary Clinton as Vice President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded in the Chicago Election Headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president's closest advisers — including Daley, former head of Obama's campaign staff Jim Messinu, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that replacement was under consideration.
The book Stacks doubled claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden despite their "near personal relationships", but eventually abandoned this step when their data showed that Clinton's addition to the electoral list would not "enhanced Obama's substantial chances."
In an interview with Martin Daily, he confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden Clinton.
"I have been active in addressing a lot of things, and it was one of them," Daily said to the newspaper.
You must remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what do we do?"
Although Daley described the study as a "necessary test", Martin told CNN representative Anderson Cooper that the campaign staff had invested enough in exploring whether this step would bring dividends to the vote.
"Pre-elected headquarters don't spend that much money on polls and focus groups unless they take something seriously," Martin said in AC 360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was exploring the possibility of replacing.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss knew about a possible reshuffle.
Although Daley said that he did not think the president "was aware" of a possible replacement, former chief of administration admitted that "possibly", Obama knew.
Martin added that "Staves doubled" does not provide a clear answer to the question whether the political sensing has reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was unaware of research into the possibility of removing Biden from the electoral list.
"Possibly," Martin replied.
Would you like a glowing ice cream in the dark?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first glowing ice cream with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came to this idea by reading a scientific article on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate a glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the language of the person who eats it, raising pH levels in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lizney me, I'm delicious," says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still at a very early stage, in terms of production, so for £200 you'll get about 2 g of substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your language at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, it will increase pH levels and ice cream will start glowing.
We've been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the luminescence of a jellyfish is four times the price of gold.
So every balloon costs me around £140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, goat, and suss gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop invisible ice cream."
It's by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
Avangarda coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking of preparing his team for the regular KHL championship match against Salavat, noted that the omichis had conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from the Magnagorical Metallurg.
The expert stressed that Avangard should focus on the defense game.
We watched a video match against the magnetic Metallurg, which quotes Chebaturkin's official "Avangard" website.
- We missed a lot of pucks, not a good time.
They missed out because of their mistakes, because they didn't play the game.
We knew the opponent had performers.
According to statistics, they've had five on-the-job attacks - three pucks have scored us.
Very good implementation.
Were these errors taken into account in the preparations for today's game?
Me and the boys, every match is carefully taken apart, we talk after the game, we prepare for a new rival.
All that matters is that the installation is being carried out.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game assignment was completed, and the score was 2–0.
Missed the locker room goal, and in the third period, they started to get it wrong.
Given how hard the game was, I didn't see the point in connecting the defense team.
We need to get the whole team down.
Now, the Avangarde has a long home series, matches go on in a day - the team's getting tired?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The most important thing now is the implementation of your moments and the performance of your game task.
Hockey's an emotional game, if you're doing an installation, it's not that hard.
Due to the new regulations imposed by Russian Customs, hundreds of furs have been standing in line on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donetsk officials have promised to provide drinking water to drivers and to install biotualets.
Hundreds of furs piled up at border points at the entrance to Russia.
This situation has arisen because of the amendment of customs regulations.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm that the Russian side is creating a queue that has not given advance warning of innovations.
Since 28 October, the Russian Customs authorities have begun to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, as reported by Vladimir Denisov, Deputy Head of Eastern Customs.
The new model document is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The crossing points are operating in a high-speed mode.
FACTOV's correspondent visited the border and spoke with truck drivers who had been held hostage.
Prices at a roadside cafe shop at Novoazovsk crossing point are rising every day, as is the turn of the fur.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching about two kilometres.
The Novoazovsk-Veselo-Voszenka Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, cargo is sent to the Stavropol edge of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia.
On Sunday, before midnight, a trucker named Alexey Golovanovev (in a photo), who is in transit from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week, is still in circulation.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an extra package of documents and cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance to which they are transported.
The minimum insurance is 4.5 to 5,000 roubles (about 1100 to 1,300 hryvnias).
Those who travel near (say Georgia, Armenia) with a load of up to $50,000 pay about 15,000 rubles (3,800 hryvnias) and pass.
And the rest of them are stuck - no one has that much money with them!
Imagine if a driver takes a shipment worth only $4,000, but even to Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (almost 23,000 hryvnias) to pay for the transit!
The conditions for survival at the border - none - are lamented by the truck drivers who have eaten near their cars.
In border shops and cafes, it's always expensive, but we've never seen a price like here!
The sellers were oriented and quickly turned them into 15 grivens worth a baron, seven grivens for a cup of coffee, and 25 griven for a plate of soup.
There's only one coffee shop.
There's no toilet.
Let's go to bed and go to the bathroom.
No washing, no shaving...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife's got everything ready for me.
For a week, another trucker, Victor Skotarenko, is comforting himself.
Will it get to my car in a week?
Why do you have a liter of water?
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias each.
What, is the bottle crystal or is the water on the silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take it while there's something else, the saleswoman is sparring.
After media coverage began, the plight of Ukrainian drivers drew the attention of the region's authorities.
The leadership of the Amtrosievian and Novoazov Raigozads were instructed to provide drinking water to all those who are waiting in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border, as stated by the Acting Chairman of the Donetsk Oblast of Sergei Dergunov.
Ambulance teams are on duty at the crossing points now.
Biotualets will also be installed for the convenience of humans.
According to the official, the issue of queues will be resolved in the coming days.
According to the Press Service of the Donetsk Oblast Administration, as at 31 October 32 and 68 vehicles had been idle at the international crossing points of Uspenka and Novoazovsk, respectively.
The Facts will keep the situation under review.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to slander the Lithuanian president.
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the countries of the Eastern Partnership, such a statement was made to the BNS agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
This information has been published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to "talk" to the President of Lithuania, Dal Gribauscaitay, and publish falsified documents allegedly found in Russian Gosarhive, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to intelligence services, the Department of Analysis of the Public Processes of the Administration of the President of Russia on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is preparing an information attack.
The structure is led by Evgeny Umerkov, who has visited Lithuania on several occasions and participated in the Congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
A member of the Department of V. Smirnov is also alleged to be involved in the operation.
According to the intelligence agency, Smirnov, under cover of scientific work, regularly travelled to Lithuania until the end of 2012 and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnova is now prohibited from entering the country.
The day before, Lithuania's president Gribauscaite stated that she knew about the information he was preparing for it.
In her view, the main reason was Lithuania's successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and the “country's desire for energy independence”
The Lithuanian leader has previously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities more than once.
In this way, she stated that Lithuania was treated “not sufficiently with respect” in the Kremlin.
In addition, Gribauskeite accused Russian head Vladimir Putin of bringing “only demands” to Lithuania.
Let's remind you, in September Rospornadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian milk into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products did not meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
At that time, the leader of Lithuania said that if Russia did not lift the ban, his Government should prepare an address to the WTO.
In the United States, the school's principal fired on teenagers.
The principals of an American high school have literally become desperate.
The man, he said, had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
As the New York Post writes, juvenile hooligans threw toilet paper at the man's house.
As a result, the headmaster of the school opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
As the hooligans were not on the director's property, he was charged with aggravated assault.
A man was released on bail at $125,000.
Note that shooting civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in the center of Ridgecrest in the American state of California just across the street.
The perpetrator then took two random passers-by hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier at Newtown Elementary School, Connecticut, a shooting was opened.
Adam's mom worked at the school, she was an educator.
Shooting in American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on 31 January at an American school, this time in Anlanth, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and make a masquerade for our neighborhood.
Now I'm more of a thief.
I haven't been called in the last two years to hand out candy in my apartment, and I'm probably not going to be there this year.
However, statistics show that I'm a white crow as far as Halloween is concerned.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and jewelry.
The only thing I wait for every Halloween is the trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent will be spent on costumes.
This year, at the peak of fashion, sexual inanimate objects.
Women no longer have to be sex workers; they may also be sex foods, such as pizzas, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies through the Walking Dead, and I'm sure that the Daft Punk-style astronauts will be in our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the costumes most often sought are zombies, Batman, pirates, and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed up our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren't the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
That means a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't mingle.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, lollipops, Milk Duds candy, Twizzlers chewing candy, and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million children requiring candy who have prepared to conquer our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and, let's not deceive ourselves, eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is candy in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Association of Confectioners, almost 35 million pounds of them are sold for Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery I've yet to solve.
Nothing like a haunted house to express the essence of Halloween.
They have amazing names, such as "The Wrath Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Wight and Cry" and "The House of Shock".
Moreover, according to the American Hunts society, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America that generate about $500 million in income, as well as those amazing photos where you almost peed, which your friend posted on Facebook, and you can't remove, and then the guy you like sees this picture and leaves a comment like "classic facial expression."
And in conclusion, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving Jack's lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, what we've been doing since we were kids.
Fortunately for us, the baby thing in pumpkin only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out those pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack's lamp, slowly drying out on your porch, probably arrived from the state of Illinois, who raised 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want to do a harder job, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try cutting something out of their 2,032-pound pumpkin.
The Estonian Ministry of Defence website was restored after an attack by Ukrainian hackers
The website of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia has been restored after the morning cyberattack, and the press service of the agency reports.
According to the Department of Defense's Vice Chancellor for Information and Administrative Affairs, Taymar Petercop, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our experts quickly set things up, and so far the site has been restored.
"The damage to the Ministry is minimal," Petercop said to the Postimes edition.
According to Petercop, it's too early to talk about who staged the attacks.
"We will necessarily analyse the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from it, but it is absolutely impossible to prevent such incidents," he admitted.
Naponym, on November 1, the Anonymous Ukraine group posted a message online in which it confirmed a hacker attack on the Estonian Ministry of Defence website and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We are in favour of an independent Ukraine.
"Hands away from Ukraine," says Anonymous's statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine reported that the Marine Company of the Teodosian separate battalion of the Ukrainian Marines would take part in the NATO response force command and staff exercises, Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Due to the violence, several schools and the hospital had to be closed.
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of Southern Matabeleland had to be closed because students had been attacked... by goblins.
According to the local elder, the children were panicking and it was impossible to continue their studies.
A story about goblins may sound like a child's fiction to a European, but in Africa it is a very serious argument for closing the school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, a hospital was closed down in Zimbabwe because medical personnel were also attacked by goblins.
Launch of the Land Rover Race Series announced
Inside are racing seats and six-point safety-belts, as well as an internal communication system.
Advanced brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support, and car storage between events are available.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said, "Rally participants turning to Bowler changed".
Some of them are not experienced drivers, but people looking for excitement, adventures, and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try different disciplines of rallying in the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of rally rye.
We were very pleased to develop a Defender Challenge car — this will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to participate in activities in the desert in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian sylowics don't know anything about the Brother Circle group - New News
This is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After media reports of the U.S. Department of the Treasury placing Leps on control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate 'Brother Circle', we looked at all the databases, but no such grouping was found," said the agency's interviewee.
In his view, the dissemination of that information helped to maintain the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which was allegedly operating abroad.
As previously written by "NI", yesterday the U.S. Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the Brother Circle criminal group.
Russian singer Grigory Leps was also named among them.
He's on the list as Grisha, posted the day before.
They match the data of a popular Russian performer.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevridze, the creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, five others are mentioned.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, an Uzbek citizen and another from the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified.
In the United States, it is certain that Gregory Leps, who resides on Phuket Island, transported money for the bandits on their order.
A photograph of the singer is attached to this report and all his data are given that are true.
In fact, Leps did recently buy a house on Phuket.
The agency noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The inclusion of a person in the U.S. Ministry's blacklist has resulted in the freezing of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him by persons residing in the United States.
Leps' assistant Maya Serikova stated that no notification to the singer had been received: "It's hard to answer the question whether it's the Gregory that everyone is talking about right now in the US scandal."
All Leps knows is media information.
Officially, there were no personal notices to him, although I don't know if there are any in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all funny on the one hand and surprising and unexpected on the other," she said to RIA News.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live on the Phuket, but according to the U.S. Ministry of Finance, he does have a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that news had caught him on a flight to the City of Enlightenment.
Ran out on the field in a Shinnick match.
Some details have come to light on the identity of the fan who ran out on the field during match 1/16 of the Russian Cup final between the Yaroslav Shinnik and the Moscow Spartacus.
As stated by the head of the KDC, Arthur Grigoryantz, referring to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Moscow.
He's in custody right now.
"In addition to this, Grigoryantz spoke about how the fan managed to break through the field: "It turns out that this one, call him an audience, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, citing heart problems.
He came up to the E.R., which was confirmed by the E.R. doctor.
And then he pushed two escorts away and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the Eastern and Southern rostrum to the corner of the Eastern and Northern rostrum.
He ran through the field.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Prior to the entry into force of the Sports Act, this is a stewardial area - the police can't interfere with what's on the field.
He ran to the rostrum, climbed through the Eastern Tribune.
And at that time there was unrest on the Eastern Tribune and the treadmills," said the head of the KDC.
Let us recall that, by decision of the KDC, Moscow's Spartak will hold the upcoming matches of the 15th round of Russia's championship against Locomotive and Zenita and will also pay a fine of 600,000 rubles without viewers.
Fire brigades were called to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous yield in his career.
Coker-spaniel Ruby ran away after she was in a small accident.
Three days later, she was stuck in a career, spotted by a man walking a dog.
Firemen came down a rope on a cliff to save the dog from imminent destruction.
The puppy was fortunate to have been rescued after fire brigades were called up to raise it and get it to a safe place, after somehow being stuck at 50 feet on the dangerous slope of the hindsight.
Ruby's nine-month-old cocker-spaniel ran away after being in a car accident on Sunday afternoon, and spent three days alone before being rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at Flappit's career in Denholm in West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby, and thanked West Yorkshire's fire and rescue service.
They were feverishly searching for their missing dog and posting addresses on social media websites after she ran off into a career after a small accident.
At around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a watchful dog driver spotted Ruby stuck at a height of 50 feet on a career retreat.
A technical rescue unit from the Clekhiton fire station rushed to the scene, descended down the ropes to save Ruby, and used a transport to lift her up the slope.
Rescue team officer Andy Clayton said, "She was in a dangerous position."
It was right in the middle of a hanging slope, 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move her muscle during the rescue, she's completely frozen.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Rescue team officer Peter Lau said, "Ruby is very lucky she was rescued."
There was a possibility that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an examination, and it was found that she was all right, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "It was scary to watch the rescue."
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when we got her back in our hands.
The vet said that if she was exhausted and passed out, she'd probably fall down.
The firemen were great.
It was very brave — what they did.
We're so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of Kitley added, "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
Firemen were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't flirt with Katie Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, a pop star stated that she was a backing vocalist for the 2004 Jagger song Old Habits die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a rocker veteran, and noted, "He was playing with me when I was 18 years old."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for 70-year-old Jagger said that he "reserved categorically that he had ever hit Katie Perry."
The representative added, "It may be confusing it with someone else."
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking off Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time, we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition for EU membership.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and a border with barbed wire along Adrianov Vale.
True, Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer movements across the rest of Europe, although — predictable — it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor has it been pointed out that EU member countries spend a great deal of time turning their formal rules as conveniently as they do.
As Scotland is now outside the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels to replace what he really wanted from the Scots.
So it's not a noteworthy story.
And so old that it turned into a fossil: for the first time, I heard a "cut" that "independence means passport control", at least 40 years ago.
Still, there is an interesting moment lost in the old tale's retelling.
Why does independent Scotland have to comply with Europe’s orders?
Why change London's yoke to Brussels's, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With Eurocrisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Party of Euroskeptics Alternative for Germany, founded only this year, appeared out of nowhere and received nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, thus effectively displacing the Free Democrats (similar to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis was a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency have led many people to think that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments operate with excessive budget deficits — that was true only for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem blocked its members at exchange rates beneficial to German exporters — which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, southern Europe finds itself in a pre-eminent disadvantage in terms of productive opportunities compared to Germany.
The only life-saving means is to cut wages and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current fiscal and currency problems is the deeper problem of Europe's productive capacities.
As a result of the green energy package introduced by Brussels — a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers — the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
It's a paralysing unfavourable price conditions, as we've seen in Granjmouth.
No global wage freeze will stop a devastating US cheap shale gas victory over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is a riot, especially in France, once the strongest supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and place Paris on the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France’s devastated economy in a desperate situation.
The result is the right-wing, anti-EU party Marin Le Pen "National Front" has just won the decisive by-election, dropping the ruling Socialist Party to third place.
Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to British Labour that it cannot be assumed that a split among the right would automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU election next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If — and this is very likely — anti-EU parties are supported in these elections, such a bloc will be able to dominate the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's my opinion: the growing sentiment against the EU and against a single currency in Europe will soon come together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become some sort of vague Europe (sovereign) nations that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will rebuild their own currencies.
I suppose Britain distances itself from this project, hoping to get close to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that Britain will be left unaddressed in the cold Atlantic.
What position does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in essence) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will succeed in a more free European arrangement, provided that we preserve our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-Federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating Norway ' s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which gained an impressive majority of votes in 2011 thanks to opposition to the spending cuts offered (and realized) by the Labour Chancellor of the Treasury, Alistair Darling, and subsequently created by a coalition of Tories and Liberal Democrats.
It would be preposterous for Scotland to vote for independence just to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Early Aging
African American and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity before their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that obesity epidemic can be a trigger mechanism for early puberty.
The trend towards early puberty is not so pronounced in boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be scared if her daughter begins to develop breast conceptions and develop pubic hair at age 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time comforting parents – usually it doesn't mean a quick onset of full sexual maturity," said Caplovitz.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and submuscular hair, and the smell of the body, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in menarche's age (the first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
"After breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years to menarche," said Caplovitz, who is also the author of the book Early Girls' Sexual Maturity: How to Cope With this Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is a discussion of what constitutes an actual onset of sexual maturity but is considered "premature" when breast growth is accompanied by a sharp increase in height to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop — something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progress can provide a basis for endocrinologist analyses to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to stunting and low growth in adulthood.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, level of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is careful about medications, but admits that "adventure to puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls that they are different from their peers."
Another big problem is that parents just don't want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues," said Caplovitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter began her menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones are responsible for milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
In boys, as in girls, puberty is early.
Caplovitz claims that the precept that has the greatest weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls between 6 and 9 years of age, which linked the amount of fat in the body to the period of puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In that country, African-American and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity before their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Throughout the world, early puberty appears to be affected by everything, from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys have hair on their faces and pubes at a younger age, the trend towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the subject.
Pimples and pubic hair appear even in infants and nursery children.
"We must be careful how we define the true onset of sexual maturity," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at Gorieb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from a pediatrician about how to speak to their child.
"This may mean an earlier conversation than expected," explained Caplovitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when this occurs earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
Stuck in Chit, American Boeing prepares for flight
As part of the Open Skies Treaty, the United States aircraft that carried out observation flights over Russian territory and made an unplanned landing at Chit on Wednesday on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 Moscow time will leave the city's air harbour.
The airport authorities allowed the flight to take off after receiving the money for the fuel.
The plane will be flown to Ulaanbaatar, reported at the airport.
According to other sources, he's going to the United States.
The plane that flew to Ulaanbaatar reportedly landed in Zabaikal Kray due to fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita Airport.
There are 30 people on board, including a crew, who spent two nights inside the airport, as reported by ITAR-TASS.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, under the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board an aircraft have no right to leave Chita Airport, they can only pass border controls at two Russian airports, in Cuba and in Ulaanbaatar.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 States parties.
Observation flights take place over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, to help monitor the implementation of arms control agreements, and to enhance crisis prevention and crisis management capabilities within OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the late celebrities make - MK in the U.S. MK
The ranking of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income was 160 million from October 2012 to October 2013.
Notably, other out-of-life celebrities who earned a few times less last year are behind him.
The second on the list of the most "situated" missing celebrities compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year was Elvis Presley, 55 million in a year, and a line below Peanuts comic book author Charles Schultz with 37 million.
Apart from these, the first five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was last year's leader (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein were also listed.
The first boutique of Igor Guliev opened in Moscow.
On 23 October, the first flagship boutique, Igor Guliev, was opened in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulyaev is known to the general public for his magnificent articles from luxury-class fur.
And now they can appreciate even more fashion fans - his first boutique finally opened in Moscow, about which the designer had a dolce vita-style party.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
That's why I'm particularly glad I opened a shop in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That's the way Igor cut the red tape and invited everyone to... try on the models he saw!
Rocket aircraft manufacturers fight over seat width when large orders are at stake
There was a fierce debate among the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a violent confrontation at the Dubai Air Exposition this month.
The controversy revolves around the width of seats provided on long-distance flights to economy-class passengers whose interests are not always the focus of airlines, while the space allocated to them plays a key role in the assertions of the effectiveness of recent aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class lounges, but its main American competitor Boeing says that this is for airlines to decide.
The dispute is taking place at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete in selling increasingly large versions of their two-engine long-range aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected at the 17–21 November event.
The composition of the back of the aircraft — especially whether 9 or 10 people are sitting in row — is central to statements on the cost-effectiveness of new mini-aerobus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in the economic class over 17 inches wide, housed 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 will be carried in economy class 350 people in 18-inch seats located nine in a row.
Aircraft giants often exchange technical strikes through professional press advertisements.
And now Airbus addresses the public directly in front of an air show in Dubai, where 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the beginning of a new advertising war could be by showing the financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant pressed against each other, entitled "Would you agree to that?"
"Boeing offers long-range main flights on seats narrower than regional turbovint aircraft," said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when wide-body Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-distance travel, and the century's border, the weight of an average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The coverage of the waist of a 21st-century average American man is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. Health Service statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the 1950s seat concept, when the average waist grip of those recently called "reactive public" was already.
Airbus says she commissioned a study showing that an additional inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus figures in seat size and says producers should not interfere in decisions on how airlines can strike a balance between tariffs and conveniences.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the passenger compartment depends not only on the width of the seat.
"It's really all about giving airlines the choice and the opportunity to do what they think they have to do to succeed," says Boeing salon specialist Kent Craver.
They don't want us to decide for them what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase space on the sides, but for suppliers this is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is a race behind aircraft orders estimated at at least $700 billion at catalic prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of American to European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, seating is precisely what fuels rivalry in the battle between the latest jet planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability by one place in their last two-engine long-distance models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365 local Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared Boeing characteristics are partly based on a comparison of the 10-seat 777X series with the original 9-seat design of the design decision 777.
Winning in unit cost decreases when compared to the 10-seat layout currently used.
"The reason Boeing does this is to squeeze more seats and make his plane more competitive than our development," said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that lounges with full 10-seat rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense seating that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
"Seats 18 inches wide would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view the Airbus proposal is driven by the 777th model threat," said interior specialist Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a vendor catalogue from which airlines can choose.
The world’s jet sellers even carry roulettes to check competing plans.
Appreciating comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very tight layouts for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10-seater rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional modifications to the lounges, offering wider passage seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of major modern aircraft, experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but may distract attention from the 777X model sales wave.
A new anti-nicotine vaccine can rob the smoking process of pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the smoking process of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from a lifetime of nicotine dependence.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Whale Cornell Medical College in New York stated that the first results are encouraging.
"We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nitrotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine hit.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, who were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And mice that were not given the vaccine "relaxed," and this is a sign that nicotine reached their brains, says researchers.
These experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine magazine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be made so often that they proved expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into an antibodies factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they had a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they won't get the pleasure of it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Olejnikov: one third of the rural settlements of Podoskovya are fully subsidized
Vice-Governor of Podmoskovya Yuri Oleinikov stated that almost one third of the rural settlements in the Moscow region were entirely subsidized
A total of 187 out of 288 settlements receive grants from the region ' s budget.
In 2013, 187 out of 288 settlements received grants from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent of subsidies.
As part of the budget, about 25 billion rubles are allocated from the regional budget," Oleinikov said.
The Lieutenant Governor also noted that only three urban settlements, Motish, Lortsovo and Pushkino, had a budget of more than 1 billion rubles in 2013.
The incomes of rural settlements in many areas are less than 3 million rubles, “that is not enough”.
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements in Podmoskovje is over 70 per cent, “with the quality of services falling”, noted Oleinikov.
He had previously instructed the heads of the municipalities of Podskovje to consider, before the end of November, which settlements needed to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or changed administrative management.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to that, the governor of the Moscow region stated that, as part of the administrative reform in Podskovje, it was planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
There is also a request in Mozhai, Kashire, Solar, Kolomena, Luberts and Kotelniks for the consolidation of municipalities.
Discussions on this issue will begin in the cities and regions of the region in November.
The Chairman of Mosoblduma, Igor Brynzalov, also stated that there were about 30 rural settlements planned in 12 regions of Podskovje that were to be integrated into the upcoming adm reform.
This is because of the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in Podskovje, less than one third have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 have a grant base.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children.
Diana Arbenina doesn't hide the great pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Although it is now that Arbenina devotes most of her time to creativity and community activities, she still finds the opportunity to deal with Martha and Artham, not only spending time teaching them, but also entertaining as she can.
In the last week, Diana reported twice to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
First, she posted a picture on Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, I had fun with fans, showing you how Artham and Martha dressed up for Halloween.
The broom races are ready! our first halloween" - that's what Diana called a picture of her children wearing holiday costumes.
Which is not wise, because they, like any other Russian boys and girls, are involved in this celebration because they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce “uncertain sex” when registering children.
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to indicate “uncertain” in the registration of children born with hermaphrodite.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the “sex” on the birth certificate for the time being.
Instead of "F" (women's sex) or "M" (men's sex), parents may temporarily record "X" (uncertain).
This decision is intended to prevent parents from rushing into a “clarification” operation.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphrodite.
Tripods deny being influenced by Obaid.
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation into the state's anti-corruption oversight body.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denies changing the lease of offshore facilities at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obaid, who secretly owned shares in three properties on state land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obaid had lobbied several state ministers to extend leases to Sercular Kee, where the Obeid family owned two restaurants and cafes, without a tender after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obaid's secret involvement in real estate, following testimony given by the former Deputy Chief of Administration, Mr. Tripodi Lynn Ashpool, on Thursday.
For several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be submitted to an open competition.
The tenants opposed this and also wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, business leases on Sercular Kee, which brought about $2.5 million to the Obeid family per year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obaid, who admitted that Mr. Tripodi had strongly recommended changes in the Government's rental policy.
ICAC's interpretation of telephone conversations included conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port ministry after working under Mr. Obaid in the Fisheries Division.
"Whether the issue discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of a commercial lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willy, Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a high-ranking official, Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria
A senior administration official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli warplanes attacked a target in the Syrian port city of Ladhiqiyah on Thursday evening.
The official didn't specify what the target was, but said at least one.
Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
On at least two occasions earlier this year, Israel launched air strikes against missiles inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers of subclass 457 may be tested for "validity"
The “trueness” test for foreign class 457 visa workers is under consideration by the Government as it proposes an expansion of repressive measures.
The test, if adopted, will be applied on the basis of criteria aimed at preventing the use of visas at the level of 457 to fill unskilled positions or as a loophole for the movement of family and friends to Australia.
The paper submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McQuew criticized the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it might hurt Australia's neighbours.
"The loud statements of "foreigners - at the end of the line" and "at first work for Australians" represent a very unpleasant backlash to times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market," she said to the Australian India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white labour was to be protected — and if some in the region saw backlashes of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The document before the discussion set out 12 measures that had previously been considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets officials about human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the “trueness” criteria are accepted, the applicant for the visa may be examined for “whether the candidate is genuine in conditions where the candidate is a relative or a close acquaintance of the owner or a person involved in the financing of the enterprise”.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of holders of sub-class 457 visas, since previously enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of an alleged heart attack after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The victim's nine-year-old son accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father's death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board.
The Australian authorities rushed a man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A friend of Semen Varlamova's stated that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of hockey player Semen Varlamov Evgeny Vavrinyuk stated that he was suffering from alcoholism, transmitting the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said a woman in particular.
Let us recall that Vavrinyuk sued for beating the Russian team Semen Varlamova, who is also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockey player pulled her by her hair and also beat her - her arms, chest, stomach and neck were damaged after the attack.
Varlamov himself came with a guilty plea to Denver police and confessed to the beating, detailing what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released on $5,000 bail.
The court did not restrict the athlete's movements across the country, but prohibited him from approaching Vavrinyuk.
He also faces a prison sentence of up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
HS2 involves the opening of a high-speed link to Scotland and North England, with the start of Phase I in 2026
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer noted that the project would "unite Britain".
Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said that he was "excited" by the prospect of working with the UK government on the plan.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When Phase Two is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and North England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and reduction of travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to cross from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal on HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other."
We're developing HS2 because the benefits it brings are enormous.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also a transport link between cities and each other; 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh throughout the UK, will receive the best service thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added, "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland".
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to "uniquivocally" support Scotland's inclusion on HS2.
Mr Brown said, "The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the general argument for the high-speed railway across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburg railway line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with British ministers next year and to taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Thorium is a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to provide for energy needs.
The combustion of hydrocarbons (where they exist) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large space for generation.
Atomic energy costs more than one, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste management.
Recently, scientists have drawn attention to thorium, another radioactive element of Mendelev's system.
It is found all over the world, and it is claimed by experts that its fission does not leave waste that must be preserved for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Australian airline passengers will need to continue to switch off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite U.S. efforts to ease the regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority has allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during take-off and landing provided they remain in Flight Mode.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required U.S. airlines to do an enormous amount of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they did not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they were considering the application, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in place in Australia.
"The Civil Aviation Safety Authority currently does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," it said.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to ensure safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety regulations communicated to them by crew members.
Virgin, which had already discussed with the Aviation Safety Authority the increased use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on board, was not opposed to changes, but stated that it would follow the direction of the regulator.
"We would welcome the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's consideration of authorizing the use of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer service now that it (a wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft," the spokesperson said.
Qantas stated that it would abide by the rules currently in force.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not planning to change it soon," she said.
The FAW Regulation applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly look closely at the FAU decision and the reasons behind it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the regulation will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to mobile radio signals, as well as to review manuals, training materials, regulations for carrying hand baggage and instructions for passengers.
"After the airline verifies and confirms the immunity of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones at any altitude," FAU said.
In rare cases, the crew will give instructions to passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, the group recommended that heavier devices should be located under seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan is heard in Kubani's anthem by notes of extremism
The football match between Angie and Kubanyu resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of Krasnodar Province and Dagestan after fans burned the Dagestan flag, and Kubani's anthem sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatips on Thursday invited Republican parliamentarians to go to court because the anthem of Krasnodar province allegedly calls for inter-ethnic strife, in particular calling for a war against “basurmans”.
Take the anthem of Krasnodar Krai, which in modern times approved this anthem in 1995.
It's a shame, and nobody does it.
"You are remembered here as the mother of the enemy, as the father of the enemy, as the basurmanine we go to the death battle" - why write such words into the anthem, poison some of the believers on the other believers," expressed solidarity with Abdulatype President of Parliament Hisri Shikhsaidov.
Putin secured impunity for his friend Assad
And now, the news from across the ocean is from Syria, where, as we have learned today, Israel struck Russian-made missiles reportedly destined for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition of destroying its chemical weapons production by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement brokered by Russia that allowed the US not to conduct the military operation they came close to this summer.
More about weapons and what this means to the Syrian president, will be told by our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel.
Washington has stated that the Assad regime will be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal made by Assad's friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria will relinquish its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A team of international experts reported that Syria had disabled the declared chemical weapons factories.
The longer-term and arduous task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say Assad's days are numbered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer a legitimate and has to leave.
But Assad stays.
And I feel even more confident.
His troops are still using artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people were forced to leave their homes, and many were starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Al-Assad has escaped punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement has been described as a success of diplomacy, the inspectors have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself has given the impression of a man ready for cooperation.
Today in Washington, D.C., the United States Ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child is starved to death, its mother is unlikely to be better off not being killed with chemical weapons.
Assad's holding up for now.
And he's changing his weapon to power.
The President of the Russian Federation has established a separate Ministry of Construction and HKH
Russian President Vladimir Putin created a new ministry responsible for construction and HKH and offered to lead it to the ex-Governor of the Ivanov region, Mikhail Menu, in the process of a private meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men at the residence in Novo Ogarevo, and Men did not refuse to lead the new agency.
The spokesman for Russian President Dmitry Peskov explained that all the functions related to construction and LHC were moving to a new ministry from the Ministry of the Region.
Mikhail Men is the son of a well-known Orthodox priest, the protoiery of Alexander Me, and has graduated from the Lipkin Institute of Petroleum Chemistry in Moscow.
Since 1995, his political career has begun - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Dumas from Sergijevo-Posad District, was a member of the State Duma, the first vice-premier of the Moscow Region Government, and vice-premier of the Moscow Government.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Men was governor of Ivanovsk Oblast.
The pawnshop owners in Singapore are doing well while the middle class is experiencing difficulties.
In a pawnshop at the Bendemir mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthaling lays a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for his daughter's schooling.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there," says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia — where household debt is increasing — is such that ValueMax, where it is making its deal, became the third pawnshop registered on Singapore's stock exchange this week.
Credit on jewellery is not just a quick way to get money (S $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthaling), but also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Usually, pawnshops in Singapore account for an effective annual interest rate of 17% – just above the 15.4% offered at the United Overseas Bank branch, a local lender with a branch at the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require credit or wage proof tests and can issue loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people in the entire region resort to pawnshops because families feel pressure because of the rising cost of living and the rapid increase in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and cheap loans fuelled by free monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families resort to pawnshops to offset the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, indicated an increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to the rise in mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list with 80% of GDP, compared with 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and in consumer demand.
"The point is that with rising prices, people in the middle and lower part [of the income scale] will seek ways to supplement their income wherever they can," says Song Seng Won, an economist of CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Recorded high gold prices in the past two years have increased the rush with which people pawn their personal belongings as they take the opportunity to get money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items laid in the city-state 200 pawnshops are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's pawn the gold chain of the grandmother and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest EastyMoney pawnshop operator observed an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
Growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemir branch and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, executive director of the ValueMax.
The company will finance expansion using 60 per cent of the S$66 million leveraged this week as a result of the listing on Singapore's stock exchange.
While some creditors had been criticized for high interest rates, she said that the pawnshop was not only offering cheaper tariffs than other creditors, nor was it directly increasing debt.
"Clinents mortgage items they already own, and monetizing personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.
The mortgage is gaining increasing public acceptance as a means of obtaining short-term, secured financing.
And the pawnshops are not only used by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax offices by laying gold bars or Rolex clocks, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
"They include wealthy persons who need to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties," said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number of health facilities available and their status that matters to the population, but the quality of health care provided.
The implementation of the programme “Modernization of Health Care in the Tula Region 2011-2013”, and the reorganization of our city's health facilities, will lead to the establishment of an optimal structure for the provision of health care to the population, including gynaecological patients, pregnant women and women in childbirth.
Thus, with the integration of the hospital, it has become even more possible to bring in specialized specialists from the NSAU to consult pregnant women with various pathologies, and to conduct additional hospital-based examinations.
During the modernization programme, the logistics of the maternity ward has been significantly improved and modern equipment has been introduced to meet world standards.
During these years, about 8 million roubles were allocated for major maintenance of premises, and 112 items of equipment worth 42 million roubles were purchased.
The most up-to-date equipment is an intensive post for newborns.
In the operating room, the Caesarean section uses the Sell-Saver machine, which allows for the collection of blood from the operating wound and, after special treatment, the return of blood to the pregnant woman, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
A clinic laboratory diagnostic unit is also equipped with modern equipment.
The women ' s clinic operates an electronic register, and the introduction of electronic maps and patient health records is planned for the near future.
The development of telemedicine has made it possible to consult gynaecological patients, pregnant women, mothers and newborns with regional experts.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens are arrested by French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been under way since March this year.
Some 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes in a Strasbourg hotel and then beat and robbed them.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old formerly tried Chechen.
Bavaria defender David Alabama became Austria's best athlete in 2013, reporting the official Bundesliga website.
In this dispute, he outperformed winter sports, which have traditionally become the best in the country.
The skier Marcel Hirsher took second place and the ski jumper Gregor Schlirensauer took third place.
Last season, a 21-year-old Filipino-Nigerian Austrian helped his team win the German Champions League, Championship, and Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Bowl.
Arshavin's ex-wife is resting with actor Andrei Chadov.
Former common-law wife of Peter's Zenita footballer Andrei Arshavin Yulia Baranovskaya spends a vacation with actor Andrei Chadov.
Julia is resting in Italy at the company of actress Anastasia Zaroad, her fiancé, figurative Sergei Slavov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Photos of joint couples walks are published in Instagram Anastasia Zaroad.
This is not the first joint picture of Andrei and Julia.
On October 5, Zavravova published a picture of a couple standing on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, Havbek Zenita, Andrei Arshavin, admitted to living apart from his civilian wife Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, with three children.
It has recently been revealed that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alice Kazmina.
Arshavin's new friend was married to the top manager of the corporation.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's health
The federal government insists that the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's weakened health system will be supplemented by stringent conditions that guarantee that the state government will not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plybersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent measures" to prevent a crisis caused by the ageing population of this island state, higher levels of chronic diseases, and system limitations.
The funding decision for four years was made after government consultations with independent Tasmania MP Andrew Wilke.
"The Government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," said Ms. Plybersek today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for the plan operations blitz campaign.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help to bridge the backlog.
There is also money for unrecorded clinics in Hobart and Loneston to improve the quality of post-inpatient care, to train health professionals, to provide mental health services and to introduce personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
"These investments will follow the ideas put forward by advanced doctors on how best to help Tasmania's health system," said Ms. Plybersek.
The Minister insisted that the Tasmania Government should work with strict accountability and responsibility.
The state will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it spends these additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million would solve nothing “unless they are followed by genuine reform that will put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable footing”.
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to bringing this state's health system out of its critical state," said Mr. Wilki.
According to the state government, these additional sampling procedures largely offset recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today's statement is a "decision similar to that of a polycoplasty".
"The reason we're here is because the Labor state government threw $430 million out of the health system," he said to ABC TV.
When the state government rips off nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, you can't pretend it's good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plybersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The screening by Guillaume Niklu of Denis Didro's novel may boast of an exceptional production and historical details, but it is also more difficult to perceive than it should have been.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760s, tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to the monastery by his family.
When she starts to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadistic apostolic woman and becomes subject to erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to dirty or sensational — and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative runs the risk of becoming a test of a moistress and an audience.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing equipment, says the observation team.
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, and an international observation team announced on Thursday, while violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the outbreak of the country's civil war almost three years ago.
The declaration of the Chemical Weapons Organization was issued one day before
The deadline of 1 November set by this organization based in The Hague to ensure that Damascus destroys or “does not work” all chemical weapons production facilities and mechanisms to mix chemicals with the delivery of poison gas and fills them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
This statement was made during the fierce fighting on Thursday in the town of Safirah, where experts believe the chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites are located, reports the British-based Syrian Centre for the Defence of Human Rights.
A group of activists who were tracking casualties through a network of activists in Syria stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of that number, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
The group stated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bashar Al-Assad, 18,678 pro-Government fighters and 187 Lebanese fighters of Hezbollah were members of the Government.
Also among the dead, according to the statement, were 2,202 army defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to a United Nations estimate of 25 July, 100,000 have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought in Safir for several weeks with insurgents, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The battles highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the tight timing of their mission to rid Syria of a toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “now satisfied that it has verified and seen destroyed all critical means of production and mixing/refuelling equipment declared by Syria”.
It added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two locations for security reasons, said the inspectors.
On Thursday, the OPCW stated that both locations were, according to Syria, “delivered and ... the chemical weapons programme items in them were moved to other declared locations that were verified”.
It was not immediately possible to ascertain whether the Safir site was one of two places that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons to be approved next month by the OPCW executive committee.
"I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said Ahmet Üzümcü, Director-General of the observation group, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year now, the civil war has faced insurgents, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad government and its security forces, which are made up of members of its Alavit sect, the branches of Shia Islam.
With regard to other events, the leader of the Rami Abdurrahman centre said that there had been a heavy explosion on Wednesday at an air defence facility in the coastal province of Syria, Ladhiqiyah.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over the conviction of the organizers of the Bali terrorist attack
The survivors and relatives of 202 killed in the Bali bomb attack in 2002 reacted with anger to the verdict of the last of the conspirators who had been brought to trial and stated that Umar Patek should be shot dead.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in creating explosive devices used in the attack.
He could be released within 15 years if he received parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of massacres in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kut, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person called a “subversive” for his reputation as an explosive craftsman should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of the mother of Perth June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
Barely holding back her tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
"I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the firing squad,” said Ms. Cortin AAP.
- I must live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters."
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device planted in a parked van outside was detonated immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the fate of three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the massacre — Amrosi, Muhlas and Imam Samudra — who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
Save his life, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last party to the Bali terrorist attack to stand trial.
He had been hiding for almost ten years, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American troops killed former Al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence evidence showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't give up," said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he did not regret how much grief he had caused other people.
The sentence is delivered in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: "Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but don't call from a mobile phone)"
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch films and listen to music, but not to talk on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, said FAW administrator Michael Worth at a press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAU how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and installation rules to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among airlines that had already submitted plans.
" Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon," FAU said.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane door closes.
They must not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain gives "good".
Passengers shall switch off their devices again when the aircraft is down to land and shall not include them until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected against electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, stated FAU.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional flight attendants, welcomed these changes.
"After the new policy is well implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option," Glading said.
We are frankly tired of being "school on duty" when it comes to this question.
But Internet connections for surfing, email exchanges, text messages, or downloading data will still be banned at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to aircraft mode.
Thus, there is still no Words with Friends, an intellectual Internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when there was a common case: the actor was removed from an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was on its way to land.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still have to be put in the luggage room because they can hurt someone if they fly all over the cabin.
Mobile phone calls in flight will also continue to be banned.
The Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU, has regulatory authority over telephone calls.
The FAU may lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Council, a national transport safety expert for CBS News, stated that cell phones were still considered a risk.
" Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know through the FCC that they can interfere with cell towers when the plane is in the air," said Rosenker.
The sectoral advisory committee established by FAU to study this issue recommended last month that the Government allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on FAHs has increased to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill argue that there are no valid reasons for bans related to security.
It is also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce restrictions as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAU began limiting passengers' use of electronic devices in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers, high-tech gadgets of that time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAU as resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines have offered passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise height for several years.
Fixed-wing aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are adapted to the wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, said Wert.
Today's electronic devices usually emit radio signals much lower than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, radiate only minimal signals when scrolling pages.
But the signals become stronger when the devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to reduce restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company uploaded an entire airliner with their electronic read devices to read Kindle books and flew on it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passengers Association stated that he considered interference with the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only isolated reports from pilots proving that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of those messages were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAW allow pilots to require passengers to switch off devices during boarding in reduced visibility.
A group of tourism industry representatives welcomed these changes, calling them a reasonable step towards meeting passengers who are now using many technological devices.
"We are glad that FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security," said Roger Doe, CEO of the U.S. Tourist Association.
Motor schools will be able to conduct driving tests
Driving permits will be open to private companies with their own computerised motorbike.
This is written by Kommersant with reference to the draft Government Regulation “On the Admission to Driving”.
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such motorcades in Russia.
It is expected that students of such “privileged” auto-schools will count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Auto Inspection will monitor the examination every six months.
If it is found that more than 30 per cent of the theoretical exams and more than 20 per cent of the area do not pass at the first time, such a school will be denied six months of privileges.
The technical requirements for motor vehicles contained in the draft Government Regulation have been in force since 5 November 2014.
The project also includes requirements for training in driving two-wheelers.
As of 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will have to take the urban driving test to obtain category A rights.
In addition, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers would be required to obtain Russian rights after passing the examination.
A bird transported by air to a safe place from a drilling rig in the North Sea has been released back into the wild.
A bird transported by air to shore after being found in depleted condition on an oil rig in the North Sea was released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was placed in a helicopter heading for Aberdeen last month, and was then released by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at the rescue centre in Alloya.
Center manager Colin Seddon said, "This water shepherd is likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has entered a zone of strong winds over the North Sea."
Looks like the bird's exhausted and was able to find shelter on the oil rig.
He added, "She was unable to take off again, so we were asked for help."
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Are Europe’s elite willing to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to gather business representatives and determine what changes UK wealth and job creators want to see in relations with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive poll of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about Britain, business, and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a broad segment of business in the UK by size, sector, and region.
The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have learned that the vast majority of enterprises are currently seeking export opportunities outside Europe, with a particular focus on countries that are upgrading and growing, while the EU countries are stagnant.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than waste time on a long and difficult process of reforming the EU's complicated institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from competition regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being in Europe’s trading zone — even 40 per cent of the large enterprises traditionally the most pro-European-built of all companies agreed.
Last and foremost, our survey of business executives revealed that the clear majority wants Britain to pursue a course to change the treaty and relations with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which was seen among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business insists on a "significant change" that will return power to the UK.
The stakes are high — achieving treaty changes and better terms for Britain will provide a 16 per cent shift in voting to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to review UK membership conditions in the EU.
It also shows that business expects that revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back to the UK.
The best conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and as our survey shows, for business this means an increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels's regulatory work.
U.S. Secret Service wired the Pope's personal phone.
The Vatican's activities are under the watchful control of American intelligence agencies.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that U.S. intelligence has been listening to all negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now a close guardian of Pope Francis.
His phone began to be tapped before he became head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also monitored.
What the U.S. attached special importance to.
The intelligence service connected to the cardinals' cell phones that gathered in Rome to select another Pope.
The residence phones, where the members of the conclave lived, were also listened to.
American spies were listening to all the main contenders for the papal throne to prevent Washington's undesirable figure from appearing on it.
Panorama magazine writes that "the big ear of the United States" continued to intercept prelate conversations until the end of the March 12 conclave.
In the United States, it is alleged that since 2005, Argentine Archbishop Bergollio has been selected as the future of the Pope.
American intelligence has also been engaged in negotiations related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives, mining information about politicians and financial flows, continues to work at the United States Embassy in Rome.
In turn, the Vatican has conceivably declared that he is not concerned about the American 'twilight', even if it does.
Holy fathers have no secrets from U.S. leadership.
The snowboarder for the Olympic bill was specially photographed
The Bank of Russia issued a commemorative note on Wednesday to commemorate the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The bill number was 100 rubles.
But online bloggers are already actively ironic about the memo note.
Following the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they drew attention to the fact that a picture of a snowboarder from a banknote could be found in photo banks.
In particular, in a free-of-charge photo repository, StockExchange, where the photograph is dated 2005.
The same photograph is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megaobsor on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in RugGear smartphone advertising.
The Olympic banknote is done in a blue-blue gamma.
On the one hand, a snowboarder flying over Sochi is depicted, on the other hand, a species of Olympic stadium and a Feverbird.
The banknote design author is Pavel Bushuyev, who won the competition among students at the St. Petersburg Academy of Art, Repin.
The presentation noted that several sports - skiing, freestyle and ski jumping - were considered, but eventually chosen snowboard because it was a relatively young sport.
According to the news source close to the CB, the regulator does not care about the public's view of the wide distribution of the snowboarder's image from the Olympic note and is currently studying the situation.
But in Gonyak, you're not too worried about the noise around the Olympic note.
The Head of the State Press Service, Natalia Nikiforova, told News that all the reasoning about plagiarism is funny.
The snowboarder on the note will turn to the right, in the photos on the network to the left, she clarified Nikiforov.
The man in the photo shoot to create the bill was filmed from different points, then the final image was chosen, on which is the characteristic position of the snowboarder.
It also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist received a salary for work.
In the view of the experts, the discussion of the Olympic bill image is positive at all.
The recognizability of the image in the bill - plus its promotion - is considered by the executive director of the Rusbrand NP Alexei Popovichev.
It is difficult to prove a 100 per cent similarity of images in the bill and in the photo banks, so claims to challenge intellectual property against the image are unlikely to be made.
The Olympic note first appeared in China - a commemorative note of 10 Yuan was issued for the Beijing Olympics in 2008.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to their estimates, the country's beer consumption will remain stable next year, and that's at best.
Although businessmen initially expected growth.
After all, this year is not a good year for them: sales fell by 7 per cent.
The head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, Isaac Sheps, Chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers, reported on this at the Third Annual Conference of the Adam Smith Institute, “Communications of everyday demand in Russia”, which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed public regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market had already declined by 18 per cent, as there had been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in recent years in terms of the production and circulation of beer, a drink with a low alcohol content, reported to Scheps.
No country in the world has such a strict restriction on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical prohibitions that are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer complained that many of the legislative prohibitions designed to reduce alcohol abuse had little impact, yet new initiatives were constantly emerging.
The ban on the sale of alcohol in kiosks since this year has hit beer manufacturers the hardest.
"We lost 35,000 consumers at once," said Isaac Sheps.
The brewers have two predictions next year.
Optimistic is the one Sheps was talking about: the sale of foam beverage will remain unchanged.
Pessimistic - drop another 2-3 percent.
In order to preserve their profits, businessmen have to move from mass consumer varieties to the premium class: beer will become smaller, but it will be more expensive.
In the meantime, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are yet to be seen.
"By my observation, the level of alcoholism remains at about the same level," said the drug doctor Alexey Sotnikov.
True, there has been an increase in the proportion of patients using surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who have "sucked" on alcohol containing tonic drinks like the Jaguar, whereas it was "drink" alcohol that prevailed 10 years ago.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford car factory in Allvoljesk.
According to the trade unions, all the laid-off were compensated.
However, much more acute than the problems of workers is the question of reducing production in the region.
A deputy of the ZakSa region, Alexei Etmanov, stated at the meeting that some 600 people had been cut down at the Ford factory in Allwolopesk.
According to him, this occurred as early as September, when about 600 people left the factory under a voluntary dismissal programme developed with the organization's union.
Workers who had chosen to resign had been offered “gold parachutes” in the amount of several salaries.
As a result, the vast majority left their jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's enough.
However, the authorities did not plan to adopt any programmes in the next two years to support regional enterprises in difficult circumstances," he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnant production in the region and the large job cuts when adopting the budget.
The Fords do not refute or confirm this information.
We're waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as he shows up, we'll definitely publish it.
Talk about labor cuts at Forda's factory in Allwologz has been going on for a long time.
For example, the company's plans to fire 600 people were reported as early as September.
The plant had previously declared the production of vehicles suspended.
The factory cited the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia as a reason.
According to Petrostata, industrial production in Lenoblast declined by 5.4 per cent after nine months in 2013.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
The U.S. will be able to use mobiles during take-off and landing.
The new regulations for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing have been approved in the United States, and BBC reports.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, and the new regulations will be in effect by the end of 2013.
However, Internet connections for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights of less than 3 kilometres.
Due to the risk of interference with the aircraft ' s radio equipment, cellular voice communications will continue to be banned.
Thus, airline passengers will be allowed to read electronic books, play tablet games and other gadgets, and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the regulations are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of electronic devices during flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobiles on aircraft equipment and aircraft controls.
According to the source, according to the U.S. example, it is also possible to review existing standards for the use of electronic devices in flights in Britain.
The Russian Mafia in the U.S. has finally established a new name, the "Brother Circle"
This week, the blacklist of "Russian mob" in America has added new names and four companies.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance introduced three Russians, two Uzbeks and an Israeli into the Bratical Circle.
One of the Russians was famous singer Gregory Leps, whom the U.S. suspects of transporting money to members of the group.
There are a total of 22 individuals on the U.S. blacklist involved in the Bratical Circle and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts expressed doubts about the existence of such an organization.
"The declaration of the 'Brother Circle' is more like an attempt to unify fragmented criminal groups," said organized crime expert and New York University professor Mark Galeotti earlier.
In his view, the "Brother Circle" reflects a popular perception of the "Russian mob".
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else to confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," quotes Mr. Galeotti of the American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Professor George Mason Liz Shelley also agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
"If they are acting together, it's more like a criminal network, but not an organization," she quotes the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Brother Circle" unites the more close Russian thief in the Aslan Usoyan law known as Dead Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, the activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zachariah Kalashov, who completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Deed Hassan, and another member, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew of Dedu Hassan.
He noted, however, that some individuals were not related to Usoyan.
In his view, they were all combined rather by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion of Gregory Leps, Russian President Vladimir Putin's favorite singer, into the Brother Circle, has attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Of course, we expect to get more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, which is why it was decided why it was put on such lists, said spokesman for Head of State Dmitri Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
Like all citizens of the Russian Federation, their interests will be protected.
The head of Gazprom Alexey Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field.
The start of construction of the Southern Flow pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazprom.
"Today there was a landmark event: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the Southern Flow pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said Gazprom chairman Alexey Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
The Southern Flow is intended to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which contains most of Russia's European gas, increases the risk to conventional routes, officials say.
Miller stated that direct association with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been removed "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the Southern Flow at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should start in other countries further along the pipeline by the end of the year.
The pipeline has an annual design capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning, in Sarat district, a Peugeot car driver set out on a 115 km road on the Odessa-Reni road and collided with a bus carrying six people.
This is reported by the Press Service of the Office of the Public Prosecutor in Odessa.
A 31-year-old Peugeot driver died in the accident.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver were injured and his leg was slammed.
The doctors provided the woman with first-aid on-site, and she refused to be hospitalized.
Ambulances also examined all other passengers.
The rescuers raised the bus with a crane and released the bus driver, whose leg was trapped in the bus door.

Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences even before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has become aware.
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with sexual offences against children before charges were made in 2011 against a child care facility employee in Karingbach, Jonathan Lord, and reported to the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
But the commission's opening statement stated that it "never dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children within its organization."
The Chief Executive Officer of Philip Hare was asked about one case in which YMCA employee was charged with offences related to child pornography and another case in which a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Ferness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He admitted that YMCA also allowed inaccuracy in its opening speech to the commission, claiming that "there were external YMCA audits that acknowledged that YMCA was at the forefront of child safety."
The evidence presented to the commission indicates that YMCA was notified that it received the second-end evaluation of four possible quality audits conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and the lower management had missed out by hiring the Lord, and failed to ensure that the staff had a clear understanding of their obligations regarding reporting violations of child security policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that YMCA corporate ethics prevented staff from reporting Lord's violations of child safety.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including that Lord had been alone with the children, had personally cared for them, had brought them to his knees, had said that he loved one of them and had allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under Lord's direction and asked to be taught to protect her children because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that she had found Jackie Barnatt, the child custody manager of YMCA's Karingbach branch, who was Lord's head, "very frightening and often hard to reach."
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the staff members' explanation that they were uncomfortable to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with the Lord led them away from the idea of reporting him.
Mr. Hare said that he had presented his opinion to the YMCA council of New South Wales that the lesson for the organization from "the Jonathan Lord incident" was not "concerning the provision of information" by staff members, and the board agreed with it.
Mr. Hare stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges were filed was made by Liam Whitley, Director General of YMCA for the custody of children.
He said it was intended to prevent corrupt evidence, but it was "exercised" and the decision was poorly implemented.
YMCA New South Wales was not a safe organization for children while working at it by Jonathan Lord between 2009 and 2011, and the commission was briefed by Professor Stephen Smolbone of Griffith University, an expert on child abuse.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and monitoring staff.
Hearings are postponed until December 20.
Fashion Week in São Paulo.
She's not just a model in her home country, she's a real star.
Although Giselle Bundchen left the job for a while, distracted by motherhood, she came here on purpose these days and this week.
The months' absence did not prevent her from keeping her place on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the world's highest-paid supermodel.
This time, she took part in a Colcchi dephilia.
The end of Fashion Week is usually the most interesting shows.
Like what the stylist Lino Villaventura organized.
Marke is over 30 years old, parallel to the production of the pret-a-porte luxury class, the modeler is active in theatre and cinema, producing plays and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 firms and companies involved in the textile industry and the fashion world participated in the closing week of fashion in São Paulo.
It is one of the most dynamic industries, employing more than 2 million Brazilians, with annual turnover reaching $50 billion.
Tony Blair said he would take a chance to return as British Prime Minister, but admits that return is unlikely.
The night before, in an interview commemorating the fifth anniversary of his resignation, a 59-year-old politician presented his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since his retirement in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador in the Quartet of Middle East peacekeepers.
When asked if he would return to the position of Prime Minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said, "Yes, of course, but I don't think that's going to happen, so..."
Milana's head coach Massimiliano Allegrey expressed regret at the no-man's performance in the Italian 10th round of the championship match with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failure at the start was due to a series of injuries to leading players.
I'm really sorry we couldn't win, but Tmw brings up Allegry's words.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't let Lazio do anything.
In the second, the Romans added, but in general, I can't say that we've lost concentration.
I had to win.
Last season, we met the challenge of getting into the Champions League.
We are now behind schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
Connoitive event experts who were moving to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy who had taken his first steps just a few months earlier, this baby with his pet Shetland pony Toffee raced through three tours to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple, the same height, received high ratings for appearance, behavior, and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybink Mounted Sports Center in Radri, near Cardiff.
After coming to a general view against the background of men and women in fine bowl hats, he shifted his cap over and proudly spent a round of two-year-old Toffy.
The judges praised Fenton for his unyearly developed innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffy got the highest grade for appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffy on his third birthday last March, and since then he's been studying with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffy make up a beautiful duo."
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second performance with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unknown people in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantigo, near Abb Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has shown horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "The entire audience was shocked, and everyone was shouting cheering and clapping."
He ran through the sand along the length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did his job beautifully.
Fenton is crazy about animals — he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Based on the way he started, he will soon be taking part in the Horses of the Year — and I'm sure he'll do well.
A representative of this annual horse exhibition said, "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together, they're a great team.
The judges commended Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for the way they presented themselves in the show ring.
They assess the coherence of the pony and the manufacturer's performance – Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper “to be reorganized” which published the call
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the front page a call for the release of the accused in the libel of the reporter, should be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The newspaper New Express, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public statement asking for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with a state share of property.
Now the New Express has to go through a "complete fix process," as the regulator reports.
The order for “correction of errors” came from the Guangdong Office in the areas of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express newspaper published several false reports about Zoomlion's listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The New Express editorial guide was disoriented," said the regulator's statement.
He reports that a decision has been made to "impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a withdrawal of his reporter's license."
He also "ordered Yangcheng Evening News Group to make full corrections to the New Express and recommended that it investigate the situation-related newspaper officials and immediately amend the management of the New Express".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he claimed financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page, stating that she supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on State television, admitting that he had published false articles for money.
"In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public confidence," he said to the state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen's confession, the New Express published an apology on the front page, stating that the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say that the practice of extracting confessions in China is still widespread, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to self-incrimination.
A U.S.-Mexico tunnel was discovered to transport drugs equipped with its own railway
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation, and electric rail systems, has been found.
The U.S. authorities described this four-by-three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret moves they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, whose zigzags are nearly six football fields long, links warehouses near the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, United States.
The area is filled with low-profile warehouses, which facilitate the clandestine loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were smuggled through it, as stated by the authorities.
According to court documents, law enforcement confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officials, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after the cannabis herb harvest in October, which made it difficult for drug cartels to deliver their product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found passage about 700 yards long, equipped with rail tracks that ran from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November.
In Belarus, pensions have been increasing since November this year, and reported to the Belta correspondent at the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection ' s Directorate-General for Pensions.
As of 1 November of this year, the average wages of employees in the Republic, applied in the previous pension recalculation, will be adjusted by 5.4 per cent and adjusted accordingly, in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on pension increases.
As a result of the recalculation of the old-age pension from November, it is estimated that the average increase will be 5.3 per cent.
The average old-age pension will be Br2 million 295,000.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million inhabitants of the Republic.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on increased pensions will increase by Br274.3 billion per month from November this year.
At the same time as labour pensions are recalculated, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplements will be recalculated in November of this year as the minimum subsistence budget increases per capita on average.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million 47,000,530 - 2.1 per cent higher than the one in force from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, the minimum labour pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and supplements will be increased by 2.1 per cent from 1 November.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion-0-years were set aside to pay pensions for increases in 2013
British police give Assanju notice of extradition
British police today gave notice of the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had given a 40-year-old Australian "official demand to surrender" to appear at a police station, adding that if that requirement was not met, he would be further arrested.
Assanju faces extradition to Sweden on sexual offences charges after he has exhausted his opportunities under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, seeking political asylum from that South American country.
Scotland Yard "has given a 40-year-old man an official demand to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice", as reported by the spokesperson.
He continues to violate the terms of bail.
The embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the police notice.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to be charged with espionage following the publication of more than 250,000 American diplomatic dispatches on the opposing secrecy website WikiLeaks.
A driver driving 130 miles an hour with a hot drink between his legs is fined £1,000.
The motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
35-year-old Andrew Howey of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to take him out between his legs.
In the Colchester Howie Peace Court, he admitted the charge of driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driving permit resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also required to pay £90 and an additional fee to assist victims of crime of £100.
A tax for foreign real estate owners will cause the London bubble to burst.
Treasury had carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but was awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had introduced a state duty rate of 7% for houses worth more than £2 million and an annual payment for buyers who decided to own houses in a partnership rather than as individuals.
To date, the state has paid for housing in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea districts, amounting to £708 million in the 2012/13 fiscal year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook stated: “It is very difficult to argue that the taxation of high-value real estate is undervalued, regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system, after the State has increased its burden on expensive houses and the introduction of related anti-evasive legislation”.
"But this move may result in some foreign investors being reluctant to buy real estate in London or current owners will not want to sell it," he added.
The cost of first-class real estate – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market at price – in London's rich southwest belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by a record 11.8% in the past year.
According to a study by Savilles, prices in central London continued to show sustained growth of 5.6% on an annual basis, but were overshadowed by an active "domestic market" with a surge in prices in the southwest, in the north (7.4%) and in the east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the dog's tail moves are linked to her mood.
Earlier studies showed that contented dogs spin their tail to the right (in the dog's view), while troubled dogs wave their tail to the left mostly.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can notice and respond to these subtle differences in tailing.
Professor Giorgio Wallortigara, a neurobiologist from Trent University, says, "It is well known that people have left and right sides of the brain in different ways involved in forming agents that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we tried to look at it from other species as well.
He added that just as in humans, the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the versatile twisting of the tails of other dogs, researchers watched animals as they watched films about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of animal heartbeats and analyzed their behaviour.
We'll probably soon figure out why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other.
Professor Wallortigara said, "We showed dogs a video of dogs -- either naturalistic versions or silhouette to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct the tail more to the left or to the right."
When animals saw that otherwise nothing expressing the dog moved its tail to the right (in terms of the spinning dog's tail), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning predominantly to the left (again in terms of the wading dog's tail), their heartbeat was increasing and they looked anxious.
Professor Wallortigara said he didn't think the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should worry about and what they should not.
He notes: "If there are several encounters with other dogs and often the wiggling of their tail in one direction is related to more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians, and trainers a better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at Bristol University Veterinary School, said it was not the first study to verify whether left and right sides mattered to dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a happy dog.
And in another scholarly paper by Victoria University in Canada, he said, "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when the wiggling of its tail was directed to the left rather than the right, instead of becoming alarmed, – the opposite behavior towards Italian research."
He said that differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in films or robot dogs as dogs.
A useful study of how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
"While there is sufficient evidence for different mammals that two brain hemispheres are used for different purposes, many details have yet to be specified, and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way and sometimes the other.
Arctic Monkeys are delaying a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This cheffield band was to perform at the city concert site Hydro on Friday.
However, the disease of vocalist Alex Turner forced them to move the show.
This band's statement was made after she was also forced to postpone the concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.

Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February.
Pope Francis will raise new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on 22 February, as announced by the Vatican on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect popes, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the selection of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the cardinal's age of 80, he can no longer take part in the election of the pope — it is the prerogative of the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In announcing this news, Vatican spokesperson Father Federico Lombardi said that a meeting of all current cardinals known as the consistance would be held before the San ceremony.
"Papa Francis decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a constory in February to facilitate planning other meetings with cardinals from around the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February the number of cardinal electors is likely to decrease.
He said that usually the pope names as many cardinals as he needs to bring the number of cardinal electors back to 120, as well as as as as many cardinals over 80 as he wishes.
Consistency next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, according to Valero.
So far, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe, and especially in favour of Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance," he noted.
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a negligible number of cardinals.
It will also be the first cardinals selected since Francisco formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with seeking ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad made his own decisions.
"Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that "full possible" that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before — all for the first time.
Valero said that popes usually promoted the cardinal bishops from major parishes, but Francis "a half of surprises - so we don't know who he's going to call."
GM withdraws a number of new pickup trucks in the United States to refine seat backs
General Motors Co withdraws nearly 19,000 entirely new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models of 2014 to address manual seat back adjustment problems, in accordance with Friday's notification from U.S. traffic safety regulators.
On some of the pickup trucks, front seats may have a defect in the back inclination mechanism.
As a result, seat backs do not meet the Federal Motor Vehicle Head Restraint Safety Standards.
"In rear impact, head restraint may not adequately protect occupants by increasing injury risk" is stated in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website notice.
The withdrawal models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM pickups began in June and represent the most important launch of the car into serial production for the leading American automobile manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM reported a defect to pickup owners in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider notification to owners due to the 16-day shutdown of the Government, which reduced the increase in car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM announced on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickup trucks and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM stocks at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon rose by 1.4 per cent to $37.47.
The scream of Obama's voter's despair
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change.
He says that Obama allowed Republican obstructionism to derail commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with Obama's reformed health system website, drone attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard University School of Medicine.
I'm reading a terribly sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in times of discouragement in the second year of medical school and give me a renewed sense of hope.
It is called "Dirty for Victory", and these are memoirs about Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients at night and go to bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and performances could be breathtaking.
The election victory was impressive, and news hosts paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates were crying out of joy, and my parents were saving every newspaper they could find.
A young team of strategists would come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his level of support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Return to the present is a rough awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I omitted my first ballot, changes have indeed taken place.
It was something I couldn't imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the lifting of the rule of "Don't ask, don't tell", the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, public health choices and the closure of the Guantanamo base, among others.
But after countless times, when I sided with the Obama administration to protect it in front of colleagues and peers, I ran out of explanations I can offer.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot explain permission to listen to foreign leaders or drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain the collection of data on the privacy of Americans by the National Security Agency or the pursuit of whistleblowers who reveal government misconduct.
He cannot explain the murder of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, without trial, or the failure to comply with State funding and spending limits during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the report's conclusions, which states that the White House's efforts to silence the media have been "the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
More recently, it cannot justify failing to develop a simple web site for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable health care.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that the leadership could contradict the political campaigns that precede it?
It is clear that elected office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and by random events such as the massacre in Newtown.
Nevertheless, it is evident from all the examples I have cited above that they were to a large extent a choice of their own by the Administration.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an obscure and crude alternative, and seemed unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I believed that in his second term, Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would live up to the hopes we have heard of for so long.
However, when Obama's rating dropped below 45% this week, it became much more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me long for a lot of promises that have gone away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton stunned Obama in the Pennsylvania primary election.
At a meeting to analyse the causes of failure, he told his staff that they must return to normal and remain true to their purpose.
"I want us to return our attractiveness," he said.
- We must remember who we are."
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave.
Deputy billionaire Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining tycoon, who has an unresolved $6 million carbon tax dispute, made this statement at a time when he was trying to shake off questions about whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding to abolish carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from political measures.
"He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they get leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Sanshine Coast seat of Fairfax constituency, with a margin of 53 votes after the recount.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the voting procedure in the elections in order to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should a decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system to come in, enter our data into the computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
Using a pencil seems strange these days.
The Electoral Commission was exploring electronic voting opportunities and had recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his programme included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and he would take his new job “very seriously”.
Public office implies public service.
"We seek no awards other than thanks to history for serving this district at a critical moment," he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders in its foreign exchange unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is further evidence that global scrutiny by regulators of alleged currency manipulation is gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they were cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world's largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be removed during the unfolding investigation, which echoes the scandal of manipulation with the LIBOR interbank rate.
After refusing to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulatory authorities this month.
"Our ongoing investigation of this issue is ongoing, and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and our other regulators," reported to the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, informed persons said that RBS had handed over records of e-mails and instant messages that had been received and sent by its former trader, the UK regulatory authority, the Financial Action Control Office (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left the RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave in his current position as the European spot currency trader at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the leader of the European spot bidding in Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by the Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher's instant communications group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to knowledgeable individuals.
The UBS bank reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said that he was investigating alleged currency market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators around the world — the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's antimonopoly authority Weko, FCA, the United States Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers conspired to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Credit Suisse also started internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, said familiar persons.
Banks view instant messages and e-mails over several years in search of cases.
The news of the audits has surged in traders in activities that in recent years have been one of the largest sources of income for the trading units of investment banks, but have experienced difficulties this year, given that low volatility of currencies reduces opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the gravity of the situation, saying that a vast and highly liquid currency market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between various trading platforms and the increased use by banks of their domestic platforms means that "you can begin to influence the market for a very small price."
This news came on the same day that Credit Suisse Bank announced that it had fired one of its London Stock Exchange traders this week, after it had caused losses of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the issue was able to be localized," Credit Suisse reported.
The Supreme Court upheld the Obama Health Act.
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama's landmark health law is constitutional, which is a major victory for the Obama administration.
After voting 5 against 4, the judges ruled that separate orders under the Patient Protection and Accessible Health Act requiring citizens to acquire health insurance before 2014 or to pay a fine were constitutional in accordance with the Government's tax powers.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2700-page law and further ruled that the requirement of the Health Care Act that states improve the requirements of Medicaid, otherwise they would lose all federal funding of Medicaid, was not unconstitutionally coercive.
Twenty-six states and the National Federation of Independent Business filed a motion to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is a cause of discord?
In the State Duma, politicians and experts discussed how to maintain national peace in Russia in the framework of the “Open rostrum”.
Among the suggestions was to ban football in the North Caucasus, because it's all scandals and discord.
Speaker Sergei Narishkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to reduce the "grade of tension in society", politicians and the media must be correct in their remarks.
He must have meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire in one of the television broadcasts if they didn't want to limit the birth rate...
All speakers also referred to measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and to measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which gave rise to confusion in the discussions.
Maxim Grigoriev stated that the events in Biryulev were "a model conflict that could have been predicted," but "we have too many people and authorities to answer for these questions," and seven nannies have an eyeless child.
The concept of multiculturalism that Europe has long practised with regard to migrants has failed, in the opinion of society, and must be found.
Historian Yuri Petrov had high hopes for a new single history textbook.
"There is still a need to create a manual on the history of the country's peoples' culture so that students in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Züganov proposed to criminalize "calls for dismembering Russia": "If the U.S. radio says you have to give Alaska to Russia, you'll be arrested and given 20 years in jail!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to inflame.
As usual, he accused journalists who bring sick and acute national problems to public debate: "There's nothing to be said in the dust of controversy!"
One Russia faction leader Vladimir Vasiliev immediately advised journalists to conclude a "chart" and agree to talk on the subject carefully, and then the same commitments can be made by politicians.
We have some 30 laws that regulate migration, and order has been established in general, as stated by Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that held regional and municipal authorities responsible for inter-ethnic peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andríchenko did not share the admiration for the law: it does not “clearly understand what it is to adapt migrants, its mechanisms and its limits.
So the actors will have different interpretations of the scope of this power.
In addition, municipalities lack the necessary personnel to deal with such complex issues, lack the means, and the methodological advice they could use is not provided by the centre ...
Gajimet Safariev, head of the Duma Committee for Nationalities, proposed the establishment of a special agency with the formidable name “Ministry of National Security” to deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who led a similar agency in the 1990s, which was subsequently abolished, opposed.
It's enough to have at the federal level a special person, a "minister without a portfolio" to whom to turn, if anything.
"We walk on the edge, the shells are tearing apart, it is very important for members of different ethnic groups and religions to stand up together against provocations, and this work should be given decent information support," said the RRC representative for the Vsevolod Chaplin Society.
There should be no neutrality of the State with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, in its view.
Here Oleg Nilov led the discussion into an unexpected course: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, still need to be looked for, but they are pushed on the wrong path, the wrong way," he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "The footballer is beaten up by the crowd, the flags burn, the comrades throw stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There's another sport called rugby...
"They won't be equal in the world in this sport!" said the right-handed.
No one will play rugby in the Caucasus! Mr. Zhirinovsky immediately intervened.
You're going to offer them a Curling!
You need to know the specifics of the country, it's like offering the Georgian Zaporizhian...
In Yaroslav, representatives of the Moscow club distinguished themselves at the podiums during a game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the Russian Federation, Arthur Grigoryantz, reported that "Cuban" was fined 500,000 rubles, transferring from the Football House the "SE" correspondent Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions have been imposed on the Red-Dar Club for the burning of the Dagestan flag by fans on the podium during the 14th round home match against Anji.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from RFPL.
We've been looking into all the materials.
A fine of 500,000 rubles has been fined for misbehaviour on the part of Cuban viewers.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei patent claims filed by Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, whose price it interrupted at the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar Consortium, which bought $4.5 billion of Nortel patents, filed patent rights infringement claims with the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match Internet search keywords with their respective advertising, as stated in the lawsuit, which is the basis of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones operating on the Android operating system of Google, which fiercely competes with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial $900 million price for Nortel patents.
Google raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering an entire $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel Patents case to the Rockstar Consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in this deal the determining factor was partly the Motorola Patent Library.
"Despite a failed attempt to purchase at auction the patents that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them," says the lawsuit.
Rockstar requires increased damages from Google, as it argues that Google's patent violation is intentional, as required by the claim.
Egypt takes the oath of first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi takes the oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of Egypt's political struggle.
ISLAMIC Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he sworn in, becoming the country's first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
In his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the shore of the Nile built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We seek a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Mursi said during a solemn ceremony aired live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations of a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," Morsi said, a 60-year-old engineer with an American entity from the Muslim Brothers, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years was a banned organization that was the target of the harsh actions of successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Morsi arrived with a small convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike the Mubarak-era presidential pomp, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his convoy on a normally busy road connecting the city's centre to the southern suburbs.
Although Mursi was ridiculed as a non-charismatic "reserve wheel" of the Brothers, his personal prestige has grown sharply since his victory and Friday speech, in which he attempted to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists, but also for all those who want to complete the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, judges in wooden panels of the hall, where he took an oath.
Morsi later headed to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra that performed the state anthem, during which he stood at the stand "quitely".
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was met with the slogan "Army and People One Hand", which chanted hundreds of gathered in the university's main lecture hall.
Founded in 1908 as a pillar of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamist student groups .
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where a rebellion broke out, ending Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and promised to return the powers of the President, whose office was disenfranchised by the military council, which accepted cases from the deposed leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath of office before the court and not before Parliament, as is customary, he does the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech at Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
A further meeting of the Tyumen Region Association of Mechanical Engineers was held at the Yalutorov Motor Vehicle Plant.
The event featured the presentation of a new line for the production of welded steel pipes.
According to business director Denis Gribanov, a marketing study on the steel market in the Tumen region was conducted in 2011 with the arrival of a new owner.
The region has been found to consume more than 50,000 tons of welded pipes per month.
It was then decided to change the profile of the plant and to install equipment for its production.
More than 7,000 tons of manufactured goods have been shipped this year.
Investment in the plant was over 120 million rubles, Denis Gribanov told me.
A new station was launched in October, allowing for a wider range.
The plant produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for the private sector, small forms of construction and the furniture industry, and a large profile for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50,000 tons of products per year, representing about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the shift to another activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - it now stands at 157 - an increase of more than 50 employees in the acquisition of new equipment.
The enterprise is re-trained and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new longitudinal steel cutting aggregate up to five millimetres thick, which will reduce the cost of the product as well as another plant, with a pipe production rate of up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the plant is about to learn how to produce pipes that are used in housing and utilities.
The aim of the management of the enterprise is to close up to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tyumen region for these products.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroumov, advised that greater attention should be paid to the modernization of the engineering industry, in addressing the managers of the industries.
This is also the case for State support to industry, which includes reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
In the current year, 150 million rubles had been allocated for that purpose, two thirds of which had already been spent.
The last commission to review subsidy contracts accepts documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of participation of local producers in international fairs.
A budget of 150 million roubles has been budgeted for the following year, which can be used to compensate for leasing fees and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million for energy conservation programmes.
The funds for reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of Tumen region for the oil and gas complex, are being reduced to 72 million roubles.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the long run this form of support will cease, as the reason for its introduction was to compensate for the mining tax that oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become direct spending obligations of the region.
In view of this, the Government of the region gives priority to direct support to industrial enterprises rather than to financing the oil industry through them.
The budget assistance will relate to investment projects to be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the emerging oil situation.
The subsidy for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage of the industry in the southern region of Tumen, and if it is eliminated, it will be difficult to compete at a price with the middle strip of Russia, where the cheaper labour force is.
Moreover, the question of the continuity of the new owner of TNC-VR, Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders in the tumenese enterprises, is unclear.
The Uvat Project Agreement expires in 2013 and no application for extension has been received.
At present, southern enterprises that specialize in oil and gas equipment cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains whether taxes on oil extracted in the Uvat region will be paid to the region or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomić will work 240 hours for an extremist social media video.
The Lenin District Court of Tomsk sentenced a resident of the city to 240 hours of compulsory work, who posted an extremist video on the social network, to a spokesman for the press service of the Regional Court on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his page on a popular social network, which is on the federal list of extremist material.
Criminal proceedings have been instituted against him under the article of the Criminal Code entitled “Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as humiliation of human dignity, committed in public”.
"Leninsky District Court considered the case in special order and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime by imposing a penalty of 240 hours of mandatory work," said the agency's interviewee.
She added that the man had fully pleaded guilty.
Azarov promised Ukrainians the collapse of commodity prices after signing an association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that prices in the country will fall significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He stated this in his interaction with the readers of his Facebook page.
I can certainly say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs charges.
Thus, once the agreement has been signed and the Free Trade Area provision has entered into force, the level of customs duties on EU imports will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices would have to go down.
"This is about goods coming from EU countries," wrote Azarov.
For other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
However, there should be no price rises there either.
Therefore, the messages on the billboards that have appeared quite a bit recently in our country, that an association with the EU is a price increase, is not quite so, or, more precisely, not at all," summarized Azarov.
Investigators check information on child abuse in Bisk
On 29 October, the media published a report that a kindergarten teacher in Biska had locked a child in a basement for educational purposes.
All the circumstances are currently being investigated by the investigators, as well as a legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten staff.
After the charge of Evgeny Vasiliev's malnourishment, she spoke
Eugenia Vasiliev, who has been the subject of close media attention for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous press publications, both on thefts in the Ministry of Defence and on her personal relations with the ex-Minister of Defence, Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and her addiction to valuable things.
However, on 1 November, the Oboronservice case's figure broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva stated, "Of course, the original challenge was one thing: to get any negative information about the former defense minister out of me."
There was blackmail for me to testify, or I'm going to jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Next we go to court, prove our innocence.
We're 100% sure of the win.
It may be concluded from the interview that Vasiliev was perhaps the one who was most affected by the words that she did not have a good taste.
It is probably a statement by Vladimir Markin, the official representative of the UK of the Russian Federation, that a collection of paintings collected by the figure in the Oboronservice case revealed forgery.
Among the property seized is a number of paintings that the hostess, confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art expertise assigned by the investigators after the seizure of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and, simply put, were cheap counterfeits," Markin noted in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they admitted they weren't stolen from the DOD, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it's just a mess," Vasilyeva says.
However, to ask whether she would plead guilty to any of the 12 criminal episodes she was charged with, Vasilyeva said, "No, of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the SC of the Russian Federation that Vasiliev had evaded the examination of the criminal case file, the figure's lawyer stated that he and his client were “not allowed to familiarize themselves with the case file”.
What was the reason for the revelation of Vasilyeva, under house arrest, who had not yet spoken to the press?
Maybe as a woman, she couldn't refuse to answer the bad taste charge?
Or is it true that Komsomolka journalists claimed a couple of days ago that she "came into an even bigger trance under house arrest" because of news of Anatoli Serdyukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the family?
The well-known war columnist "KP" Victor Barantz wrote in his article "Serdyukov back to his wife?", "Students do not rule out that after such a shock she may become more chatty in interrogations."
In the past, Vasiliev took over some of the charges of illegal sale of real estate from the Ministry of Defence.
Presumable trouble.
What needs to be done in the garden before freezing starts
From the fungicides in the fall, it is better to choose copper-containing drugs, e.g. 1% Bordian mixture or Abiga-Pick, Oxihom, Ordan, et al.
Do you think travel agents went back in time because of the Internet?
There seems to be a reverse trend in Flight Centre.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record income from resters in Australia and the UK.
This tourist firm now expects its main full annual profit before taxation to be between $325 million and $340 million, as compared with the previous forecast, ranging from $305 million to $315 million.
If the current benchmarks are met, this would represent a 12 to 17 per cent increase over the record $290.4 million gain in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre earned 8 per cent of profits in the first half and started the second half with good performance, especially on week-long trips to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits in our 10 countries, and for some of them a record high return is expected in the full year before deduction of interest and tax contributions,” he said.
- This includes Australia and Britain, which usually bring us the largest profits."
In Australia, leisure businesses recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the UK, the Flight Centre's leisure business went well, while corporate clients spent less.
Her business in the United States compensated for losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half, and profits are expected for the third full year in a row.
Last night, Flight Centre stock grew by 3 cents to $38.20.
On October 31, the Barnaul police discovered two playrooms.
The first worked in the Industrial District on Flying Street.
At the time of the inspection, there was a game at the establishment.
The club counted 24 machines.
Another play club was found in Lenin District on Anton Petrova Street.
There were 20 slot machines used here.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation reports on Barnaul that administrative material has been compiled on the article “Illegal organization and gambling”.
The tech's been seized.
In the near future, the case files will be sent to the courts in the industrial and Lenin districts of the city.
In Yekaterinburg, the perp killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are searching for a criminal who has brutally killed two sisters.
Their bodies were burned after the murder.
According to the “New Region” press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation for Sverdlovsk Oblast, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were found the day before in the Kirov district of the Ural capital after a fire was extinguished in a three-room apartment located in a residence on Ural Street.
The identities of the dead were soon identified.
It turns out that they are sisters, one of whom is a resident of Catherineburg, 44 years old, and the other is a 33-year-old resident of Orenburg Oblast.
They rented a burnt apartment a few days ago.
His investigation came under the personal control of the chief police officer of the Mikhail Borodin region.
The internal affairs authorities worked out various versions of the murder, and checked the alibi of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
It also establishes the purpose for which the women rented the apartment and where they had lived before, what they had been doing and with whom they had been in contact.
Schools were encouraged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature beginning in 1914.
The examination will also be presented with "out-of-programme texts" to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course in English literature and language will be cancelled.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to take a separate final language examination, with persistent recommendations for selecting English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education is due to produce new curricula in English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subjects to be radically revised.
It will make changes to other substantive items next year.
A separate regulatory body for the OFQUAL examination will present a revised structure for the secondary school final examination, with a new rating system and fewer coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that he had "come to a broad consensus that we must reform our examination system to restore public confidence," insisting that school graduation exams would be "more complex, more ambitious and more stringent."
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours per year, while in Singapore students do about 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to mathematics in the schedule, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school mathematics graduation exams, combined with an increased coefficient in the ranking table, are likely to provide an incentive for schools to provide additional training in this subject.
In the curriculum, more emphasis will be placed on “real life goals”, including financial mathematics.
The tickets to Hayha will cost tourists 2,200 rubles.
As of tomorrow, from the Good News in Hayhe, tourists will begin to carry ships on a pillow.
For those who want to go to China, that means extra money.
The puma ticket is traditionally much more expensive than the heater.
As reported by Amurasso's help desk, the cost of a normal ticket would be 2,200 roubles.
It'll cost 2,800 rubles to drive through the high-comfort hall.
By the way, the tickets did not cost much this season: for the same price the pumas carried tourists in the spring and in the fall a year ago.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rate of the Russian Federation is insufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the Russian Federation's growth rate of its GDP insufficient and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business credit and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, reports Reuters.
We were planning GDP growth this year around 3%, maybe even a little more.
It'll actually be a little less than 2%.
Against the background of recession in a number of countries in Europe, it seems not to be very bad, but it is not enough for us, because the economic base is not as strong as in a number of countries, and in general, a faster pace must be taken to develop.
It is now very important that Russian companies, Russian businesses, receive normal loans at normal prices - the first thing that must be done," the head of government stressed.

Travel through mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend receiving hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country — only one per 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device.
Dr Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main characters of the 2013 CNN.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main heroes to make him the CNN Hero of the Year.
This man will get $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwell saw his father return to life and return to unconsciousness, wandering through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, his arm was only broken, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that resembled herself for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwell.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwell accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they might have received.
"It's not easy," Bwelle said.
- You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., run to the hospital to be first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation has not changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if the Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them wouldn't be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of health spending in the country is private.
"His only problem is poverty," Bwelle said.
- And because of poverty, they can't enjoy their lives."
Seeing his father's suffering and so many of his compatriots, Bwell was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes weekend trips to rural areas to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 other people are forced into vans, tied to the roofs by medical supplies and travelling across the border to visit villages in need of assistance.
They're not always lucky.
They've had to push cars through rivers and mud many times.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as real heroes: it is a festival with songs and dances and the best facilities the locals can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed a cause for celebration, and Bwelle, with his broad smile and unlimited energy, is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the brigade begins receiving hundreds of patients.
"We accept 500 people on every trip," Bwell said.
They come from the entire county within a radius of 60 kilometres of the village, and they walk.
Each of these clinics provides a variety of health services on a day off basis.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for the school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anaesthesia.
Operations are generally conducted in a school, municipality or home building; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the post-op area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to light the operating and sanitary treatment of equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers operate until early Sunday morning.
It's too fast, but the team's commitment usually helps to support the village musicians.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake and working," Bwell said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that his free hernia treatment surgery would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these weekend clinical treatments and working at the hospital as a surgeon, Bwell also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It was this second job, he said, that provided 60% of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest was covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in Bwell's band.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to make money for the organization to keep these campaigns going.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in his tasks, it is an opportunity for practice that they would never get at home.
"We were given the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold tools for Dr. Bwell," O'Malley said.
As a sophomore student, you would never get that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But on arrival in Yaoundé, their meals, transportation and training are paid for by Bwell.
"He's a hero, no doubt," O'Malley said.
He gave his life to that organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon was endless.
For Bwell, an almost constant workload is not a heavy test.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling their father’s promise, is what brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy doing this job," Bwelle said.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh to reduce their pain.

Snowden agreed to testify about Merkel's wiretapping.
A member of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele met Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the interview, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the Attorney General's Office of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case concerning a possible wiretapping of the telephone of the German Chancellor by the U.S. Attorney General's Office.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or Germany.
He made it clear,' said Hans-Christian Strebele, "that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
First, however, the conditions for his arrival must be clearly defined.
Meanwhile, American legislators are beginning to respond to a scandal surrounding US spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill yesterday imposing additional restrictions on the American electronic intelligence agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
This was stated to journalists by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Mackay, at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoğlu, and reported by Belta correspondent.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the public administration of the two countries will provide worldwide assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts with each other," noted Vladimir Mackay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would provide all the necessary facilities and cooperation to that end.
The Minister also reported that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara, following which a protocol had been signed.
The parties have drawn up a road map for Belarusian-Turkish interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy agency, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, economic and investment, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture and energy, as well as seeking new forms and areas of interaction.
“The protocol of the previous meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey regard each other as reliable partners”, he said.
The Foreign Minister of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoğlu, in turn, reported that in the negotiations held, the heads of foreign policy agencies of the two countries had decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
According to the Minister, the trade between Belarus and Turkey should be increased to $1 billion.
Turkey was also an important partner in investment cooperation, which should be further developed, as there was an unused potential in that area, he believed.
Relations between our countries have always been very warm, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
All necessary conditions will also be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," noted Ahmet Davutoğlu.
Obama renounces his words about health care
Among the storm of criticism, President Obama went back yesterday on his often repeated, unequivocal promise that "if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it."
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people are receiving notices to stop service delivery from their providers, the Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama made a few mistakes on his original public promise.
"Most people with health insurance that works can keep it," he said in his performance in Boston.
Referring to what he described as "a revival in the news" about the cessation of services, Obama called on the receiving Americans to seek other options in the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better, integrated health insurance plans at the same cost or even cheaper than predicted.
"You'll get better terms," he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Health Care Act.
"Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better," Sibelius said in a statement to the House of Representatives' Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the law on affordable health care, said that the launch of the Internet sales site has been "horriblely bad" since October.
"I'm as upset and angry as anyone," she said.
- I really want your trust back."
An irritated Sibelius dropped this phrase, which was picked up by a turned on microphone sitting behind her to an assistant at yesterday's House hearing after a heated debate with House Member Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, on whether she herself was obliged to join Obama's health program.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Siebelius to say why the "architect" of the Affordable Health Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now imposes on millions of Americans.
The Rosbalt Agency revoked media status for uncensored war
On October 31, Moshorsud decided to invalidate the Rosbalt Agency's registration licence, writes Lenta.
Roscomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of media status, for systematic and gross violations of the media law.
In the course of the trial, an unpleasant precedent was set: the court considered it possible to close the media, effectively denying the publication the right to counter-arguments.
What's "Rosbalt"
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private Internet SMI in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications were (and still are) notes referring to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to the power structures continued throughout the Agency's existence.
While Rosbalt had an extensive source base in various agencies, it was also suggested that Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Victor Cherkesov, was in charge of the project.
However, Chaplin's role in the management of the Rosbalt is not fully clear: she is most often referred to as the “project manager”.
Larissa Afonin is the director-general of the agency and editor-in-chief, Nikolai Ulyanov.
In recent times, Rosbalt has not featured in federal media ratings - either by quote or audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the attendance rating of Russian media websites according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the website rosbalt.ru is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), and the monthly audience is about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are notes on the Kremlin's powerlessness with Ukraine, the death of the band's soloist King and Fool, and the pogroms in the Metropolitan Biryulev.
Rosbalt's conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the Media Act came into force prohibiting journalists from engaging in uncensored fighting.
The agency found banned lexics in two videos published on the agency's website ("Gigit of Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot desecrated oil towers").
The other parties describe in different ways.
Roscomnadzor accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the media law on the basis of video footage and requested the court to withdraw the agency's licence.
Rosbalt stated that the agency's claims were wrong: first, the videos were not editorial material; secondly, the mother's words in them were disguised; and thirdly, the videos were removed from the site immediately after warning.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor ' s claims to the Peace Court - and when Moshorsud accepted Roskomnadzor ' s claim on 22 October 2013, the complaints were still pending.
However, on the 25th, the justice of the peace had ruled against Rosbalt: editor-in-chief Nikolai Uljanov had been found guilty of violating the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20,000 rubles - 10,000 each for each video.
Obviously, this prejudged the outcome of the Moshorsud hearing - if you give up the thought that the outcome might have been prejudged earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to invalidate the Rosbalt registration certificate, effectively depriving the agency of media status.
It is not possible to say that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency supported the deputies of the State Duma (an application to the head of Roscomnadzor, Alexander Jarov, signed 26 deputies on 10 October; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the CRC).
The President of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Vsevolod Bogdanov, Pavel Gusev, Chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, and Mikhail Fedotov, Head of the Presidential Council for Human Rights, claimed that the publication had been illegal.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, Roscomnadzor's leadership even provided him with some assurance that it would not come to an end before the licence was withdrawn.
The Rosbalt trial showed that under whose jurisdiction the media in Russia is safer today is a big question.
Syria destroyed chemical weapons equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities and has recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament has been completed by Damascus on the day before the deadline.
Prior to 1 November, Syria was to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare chemical warfare agents for use, transferring to the BBC.
The destruction of the stocks themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the OPCW representative, the poisons are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on 21 August in the outskirts of Damascus, according to the United States.
The primary task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from being repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November: by that time, OPCW and Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of poisons.
There's a lot of questions.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian declarations will be carefully checked by the Western intelligence services.
They will readily advise the inspectors on new sites for verification if there is reason to suspect that Damascus is not completely candid.
The US believes that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community required the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached through Russia, to destroy or disable all capabilities for the production of projectiles, poison gases and liquids and to fill the shells with these substances.
Now that this phase has passed, the next step should be to destroy the chemical weapons already in the possession of the Syrian army.
It is assumed that there may be more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, dermal gas and other banned chemicals stored in dozens of different locations.
Its destruction requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities agree on a timetable for the first time — two weeks.
OPCW Field Operations Manager Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors were "personally watching the destruction of the equipment."
"They no longer have the capacity to further manufacture or mix chemical weapons," he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and found that the projectile and poison production plants were either destroyed or rendered inoperable.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to be inspected there, as stated in the document, but the equipment from there has been transported and verified by OPCW experts.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical weapons infrastructure was "especially difficult" as it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW won the Nobel Peace Prize, but according to Smith, it is not yet time for the inspectors to celebrate — they were too busy working.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage "has gone inappropriately far"
John Kerry demonstrated a relaxation of U.S. surveillance defense tactics, making an unprecedented admission that in some cases US espionage "has gone inappropriately far."
The Secretary of State also admitted guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being "on autopilot" during Edward Snowden's high-profile revelations about NSA spy activities.
These leaks put the U.S. government at the centre of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking by video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said, "There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the government, have actually taken some of the things going on on on autopilot, because this opportunity already existed — both during World War II and during the very difficult years of the Cold War, and certainly September 11th."
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone inappropriately far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain himself to people, and he is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted with good intentions and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We work in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, detonate people and attack Governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happened?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building bombings, and killing people because we were able to learn about these plans in advance."
Meanwhile, American legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. espionage abroad and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the US, said the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs on Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"For U.S. national security interests, it is really important that Europeans remain our supporters of our common anti-terrorist efforts," said Democrat Murphy, who serves for the first term and is chairman of the Senate's international affairs subcommittee on European affairs, in an interview from Washington.
- And I'm going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs."
The news that NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some US allies, although the agency's head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the US.
Other revelations included documents released by Snowden indicating that NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone as well as the telephones of some 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended spying on the allies as necessary and said it was a routine case on both sides.
Against this background, Murphy said that his office would arrange for a travel of members of Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
He said that the programme of the visit was still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relationships, he said that some degree of "hardness for better motives" would also be manifested.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people about what spy programs they themselves have used for many years.
"While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence activities," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry should go to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address issues of hostility to the US strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran, as well as US intelligence activities.
In the new composition of the public observation commissions, the influence of prison inmates will increase
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (PS) can approve new compositions of the Public Observation Commissions (CSCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voting option is adopted, the lobbyists of the silos will increase their influence.
ONC is a public body that monitors the conditions of detention in places of detention.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Rassiev, the unrest in the Copenhagen colony - it is through the ONC that most of the high-profile incidents are publicized behind bars.
There is a struggle between human rights defenders and silo lobbyists to control the ONC.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the ONC, I proposed that the human rights experience should be a criterion for selection.
"It was not accepted, and lists were formed without establishing criteria," says Valery Borschchev.
Borschev is the current Chairman of the Moscow Supervisory Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, a pan-Russian body of human rights defenders working on prison issues.
As a member of the State Duma from Apple, he drafted a law regulating the activities of the ONC.
The OP Council should vote for ONCs in 43 regions of the country.
Fewer than a thousand applicants apply for 1,800 vacant seats, and in Ingushetia and Cabardino-Balkaria competitions could not be organized due to lack of candidates.
OP promises to organize a pre-recruitment for vacant seats.
The Moscow ONC is one of the few competition commissions, even though the new membership will have 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borschchev, in the current composition of the Metropolitan Commission, 11 human rights defenders and 9 silos, and in the version that is voting on the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
Thirty human rights defenders wanted to join the Metropolitan Commission.
However, a representative of the "Boy Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin may be re-composed.
He has been a member of the ONC for three years, but has never visited a prisoner.
Borschchev believes that the Silivists, by appointing their president, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so human rights defenders do not exclude collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of the silos is coordinated by the member of the ONC, Anton Flowerkov, who heads the Russian Officers, an organization that defends the interests of the security agencies.
"I don't eat babies on a trek," said the BBC Daily Anton Flowers.
He denies lobbying for any lists and says he does not intend to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opponents.
According to Flower, he wasn't even interested in what list the OPs are voting for.
He considers the disclosure of Borshchev information to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chilean ONC.
Her former leaders will be suspended because of last year's Copenhagen riots.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the local commission had ignored the prisoners' problems.
But ONC Rostov-on-Donu can move from human rights defenders to silos.
From the new lists, a human rights defender-chairman of the local commission had disappeared, but one of his opponents had turned out to be, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber had ruled him out for unethical behaviour.
The lists of the Moscow and Rostow Commissions of Borschchev consider "the estate of Kopeijsk".
The revelations of Hope Tolokonnikova did not affect Mordova's ONC, which is considered to be "strong": only one human rights defender wanted to join the new staff, and she did not even have the documents for the contest.
Board member OP Nikolai Swanidze told the BBC Daily that he had voted against the proposed list as he resented the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague, Pavel Gusev, says he voted in favour because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
He coordinated the development of the UNC rosters by the Deputy Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, who is also a staff member of the FSI Research Institute.
The mushroom told the BBC Daily that it was not the right thing to divide candidates into human rights defenders and silos and did not agree that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient authority to obstruct the work of its members.
The fungus is not supposed to predict the outcome of the CP board vote.

Australian woman appeals against imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by the Phuket Provincial Court on 15 June of filing a false lawsuit following a report by Thai police that a local taxi driver had carried out an attack on the night of Sunday 10 June, while two other men held her.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking her relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
Prior to the trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a general-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuketa, rather than in a women's adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who applied to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was "extremely concerned" about its daughter's well-being and waited for her to return to Australia.
"It is obvious that this was an alarming time, but we hope that she will return home safely as soon as possible," Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail at 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on vacation in the Craby Resort Area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that an appeal could result in the court increasing her sentence to two years and forcing her to serve her sentence in an adult prison.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its damaged tourist image, leading to acquittal.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris for the presentation of his novel, Yeltysheva, translated into French.
Let's remind you, it was this novel that became the finalist of four prizes: "The Clear Wallet", "Russian Booker", "National Bestseller" and "Big Book."
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded a cultural prize by the Government of the Russian Federation.
Roman Senchin is an undisputed leader in the generation of the current thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prozaics.
Virtually every publication of its hard-core, modern-day narratives and narratives has sparked heated controversy among critics of a wide variety of backgrounds.
It can be argued that collected articles on prose and publicism of Senchin, reviews of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s until the early 2010s.
In the debate about the works of "one of the most controversial contemporary writers," according to critic Sergei Chuprinine, the talk is mostly about what its participants are meant by the word "literacy" as they see the present and future not only of our verbality, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow most articles and reviews from the regional media and blogosphere to be included.
Analytical and overview articles are generally given in the abbreviations in the sections “Absassians”
