I want to address all political commentators, political scientists, talk shows.
Don't demonize the people of the Khabar region.
This is where the hardworking and wonderful people live, as Michael Degtärev told them.
In an interview, Degtyarev recalled that he was a member of LDDP and a one-party Furgal and added that he wished him luck in court, and the party and personally Vladimir Zhirinovsky would provide support in court.
The full text of the interview is published on KP.ru.

Semilarski v. Prosecutor's Office: the cassation of former Vice Mayor Tartu will be considered on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be adjudicated in early September.
The courts of the first two courts refused to hear the Semilarski claim, but in April his cassation appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant, as her authorization did not fall within the competence of the Administrative Court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damages incurred in criminal proceedings.
"The prosecutor's office and the county court are responsible for regulating such matters," was previously explained to ERR correspondent, Tartu court spokesperson Anette Crutzmann.
She claims that Valvo Semilarski appealed the decision to the District Court, which did not change the decision of the Court of First Instance on 5 February.
Now the State will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's defence counsel, jury lawyer Oliver Nyaes, his client had been unduly suspected of bribery for about two years.
He now demands that the Public Prosecutor ' s Office refute the incorrect allegations against him and compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint with the court was the statements made by the Prosecutor for Special Cases of the Luuna District Prosecutor's Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with another vice-mayor Tartu Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes at the time.
"Remember that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that Tartu's leaders, one of the most influential bodies of local self-government, were corrupt.
These public suspicions hanging in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have proved false, the D.A. doesn't want to say anything about it," commented Semilarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyaes, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecution should operate.
"The allegation of bribes and corruption turned out to be false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia as well as on Lithuania that, during the investigation phase, State representatives must be careful in selecting words so that suspects are not represented as criminals before sentencing.
The Public Prosecutor's Office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which unfortunately was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski," Nyaes said.
“Semilarski's public representation as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still revealed are unacceptable, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfairly towards the complainant”, added counsel.
As Rus.err.ee wrote, former vice-mayor Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted for bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, a former official is tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption law in transactions of a particularly large size.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, former Deputy Mayor Tartu participated more than thirty times in the City Hall meetings in making decisions related to Tartu companies with whose owners or leaders Semilarski had been actively interacting at the personal level outside of working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarsky had personal interests, so he had to withdraw from decision-making.
Earlier, as Rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecution office had suspected Semilarski of receiving bribes and violating anti-corruption law in transactions of particularly large size.
This occurred in October 2016, when he was detained together with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centralist Party).
At that time, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both vice mayors.
Both officials then resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached a court that fully justified politics.
The investigation into the Valvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.
An ex-soleist of the Hands Up group visited the Tver Oblast
The ex-soleist of the "Rookies Up" group, and now the solo performer, businessman and actor Sergei Zhukov has posted a picture of Kalyazin of Tver Oblast in his official instagram account.
Photo published a day ago, Saturday, July 25.
"I raise my hands to the new Baby and say hi to you from the drunken, fresh air!
What's the weather in your town?
We don't have rain today, but it's not up 20 yet," writes Zhukov on social media.
The singer is probably resting in the beautiful city of Tver Oblast with his family.
Residents in the region have already thanked the performer for the visit and have expressed their hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Baby" referred to in the post is probably due to a new version of the old song Zhukov has now recorded with blogger and musician David Manukian (DAVA M).
However, most fans remain behind the old version: "Sergey, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
Support me with the devotees of Hands Up, "We don't need a new baby."
Most people write directly that the original, which in time became a hit, is more enjoyable.

How the CD’s decision to reduce the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to reduce the key rate again.
It dropped by a further 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% annually, formally another historical minimum.
Based on the return of a brief reduction in the rate, as well as the tone of the CB statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks more optimistic about economic prospects than before.
This means that the current monetary easing cycle may soon stop.
"We have continued to soften monetary policy, primarily considering that there are still risks of inflation falling from 4% in 2021," said Bank of Russia head Elvir Nabiullin.
They are linked to a significant decline in economic activity and a decline in domestic and external demand.
Economic recovery, according to Nabyullin, will take more than a year and a half.
She noted, however, that following the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes had been revitalized: energy, consumer and investment demand had been restored, consumer goods had been built and produced, and the annual rate of decline in transport and production had slowed.
According to the updated BC forecast, the economy will decline by 4.5-5.5 per cent in 2020 (presumed 4-6 per cent) and recovery in 2021 will grow by 3.5-4.5 per cent, and in 2022 by 2.5-3.5 per cent.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast at annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per Urals barrel in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
Previously, the CB expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the inflation forecast of the Bank of Russia for 2020 was 3.7 to 4.2 per cent, compared with the previously anticipated 3.8 to 4.8 per cent.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, and is viewed by the Russian and CIS economists Renaissance Capitala by Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced the key rate for over a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the CD dropped it by one percentage point because of low inflation due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the stagnant economy due to the pandemic and its associated constraints.
The chances for monetary policy pre-adjustment persist (at the next meeting on 18 September and until the end of the year), but the limit is close, agrees with Rosbank's chief analyst Evgeny Cochelev.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to the proximity of a pause in easing interest policies - disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to prevention measures, and faster (than expectations) recovery of demand, he says.
In addition to the subsequent actions of the Bank of Russia, greater attention will be required to the inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as to the external volatility increased in the context of geopolitical conflicts, Cochelev points out.
In one way or another, a reduction in the key rate will further reduce the rates for the most reliable borrowers, and perhaps also on mortgage, says the senior economist at the Open Bank's think tank, Maxim Petronevich.
The adjustment of the rates would be less pronounced than the reduction in the key rate, he explained.
Demand rates may fall by an additional 0.3-0.6 percentage points in the second half, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7 per cent, without excluding the BCS Premier economist Anton Kadovic.
Average deposit rates, in his view, would also fall - in the coming months they could fall to 4.2-4.5 per cent (now barely above 4.5 per cent).
They can go down to 4% if the CB lowers the key rate in the fall, considers Kačatović.
The Centralist Party promises to pay all its debts by the end of the year

Interview: Lithuania's ruling Union of Peasants and Greens again led party rankings
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, led the party rankings.
This showed a survey conducted by Wilmorus pore sociological research company to order the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary election, the peasants lost their first place and led Russia's main critic in Lithuania for a long time, the opposition Union of the Nation - Christian Democrats (Conservatives).
Recently, however, Lithuania's President, Gitanas Nauseda, after assessing the electoral capabilities of the parties, stated that the Union of Peasants and Greens after this year's parliamentary elections, would probably be able to form a coalition again.
This statement provoked resentment on the part of the Conservatives.
The latest survey showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 per cent of voters would vote for peasants and 17.2 per cent for Conservatives.
According to Director Vilmorus Vladas Gadis, the break-up was within the margin of error, and yet the rulers stopped falling behind the Conservatives.
According to Gadice, the sociological success of the peasants was facilitated by the news that Prime Minister Saulius Skvernyas would lead their electoral list.
This politician was the first on the peasant list and in the 2016 election.
In third place, the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 per cent of respondents are now willing to vote.
She suddenly lost 2 percent to me.
Fourth, the Labour Party, led by Russian businessman Victor Uspassky (6.2 per cent).
The remaining political organizations, according to the survey, will not yet be able to overcome the 5 per cent electoral barrier.

Excessive requirements for applications for public procurement are excluded by law
The law may establish exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in the procurement.

The bill was drafted pursuant to the road map for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-sized Entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation up to 2030, approved by the Government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that the requisitioners are entitled to request from the small and medium-sized business participants in the application.

“The adoption of the instrument will avoid arbitrary contracting out requirements for the composition and content of applications by participants in small and medium-sized enterprises”, the explanatory note states.

The authorities of Podskiy reported on the fate of the closed dumps
Solid domestic waste landfills continue to be closed down in Podskovje.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfill sites are being upgraded to modern landfills.
But this is not possible for every site, many of which have been abandoned by a dense residential development.
Once the site closes, it rises to recultivation - the body of the site is sprinkled with soil, gas-freeing systems and infiltration systems are installed.
This makes it possible to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill so that it does not ignite, fragrant, and poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former dump remains to be raised by a useless pile among the surrounding residential development.
Why don't we do something useful about it?
For example, in Ruz, where the recultivation of the Annino site was completed just the other day, authorities are considering making a ski slope out of a pile.
This site, which operated from 1976 to 2016, grew so far that it went beyond the boundaries of the land allocated to it.
Therefore, the remediation had to buy out neighbouring areas, de facto long-stowed with garbage.
"For a while, the landing range, the fortifications, and we're gonna think we can do something to make it work.
It's a ski resort that's staring right into the eye," Nikolai Parthenov, the head of the Russian District, told journalists.
Two sites will be renewable energy sites
The Torbeevo polygons in the Luberzas and Timohovos in the Borodsky District will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
At the end of the year, a gas-pumping power plant capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal power will be launched in the territory of Torbeeva, which will provide the site with its own needs, namely, the heating of administrative and production facilities.
Timohovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and continue to operate as a waste treatment facility.
And a museum could be set up at the Kuchino Balashkin Range, which was closed after residents complained to the "The Right Line" with the president of the country.
"It was the idea to create a museum for recultivation of Podskovya sites," reported Deputy Government Representative Dmitri Kurakin, Minister of Ecology and Environmental Management.
Israel reported a drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli Army unmanned aerial vehicle fell in southern Lebanon.
The armed forces reported that it collapsed "in the course of operational activities".

There is no risk of leaking information," says an Israeli army report on Twitter.
Let us recall that this week the Israeli army decided to reinforce its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing revenge from the Lebanese Hezbollah movement for killing its fighters in Syria.

Vrio of the Governor of Khabarovsk Krai, Mikhail Degtjarev, joined the campaign for the first time since his appointment in support of the arrested ex-Head of the Sergei Furgal region.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, so she sent you a Vrio to keep the region from falling apart without power... and I say again about the Furgal: he's my comrade, "b" is one-party, "c" I'm very concerned about his fate, the party's helping him, handing him the food, Girinovsky's knocking all over the offices," said the governor's vio
According to Degtyarev, Khabarovsky Krai cannot now remain without a leader, so he was appointed to head the region by decree of President Vladimir Putin, so that "the wonderful building (the government of the province) functions, everything works, the budget spends on social needs."
The governor's Vrio explained that he had not been to the protesters before because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
So he's broadcasting on social media and reading all the comments on them.
On 25 July, two consecutive protests took place in Khabarovsk.
Findings in support of the former Governor have been held in the region since 11 July.
On the eve of another action, Mikhail Degtärev stated that he would leave town on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters and called for a statement on the fate of the arrested ex-Governor of the Furgal.
Degtärev had previously refused to go to the shareholders.
"There's really something to do about the manager than to go out and communicate with those screaming under the windows," said the governor's vio.

Throughout the pandemic, the world has already recorded 15,785,641 coronavirus infections, and the number of deaths has increased to 640,016.

The beautiful high minarets just decorated Aya-Sofia.
Once again, about Aya-Sofia, there was a text about Vladimir Zielinski, which must be protested.
First of all, there's a free entrance - hooray!
I haven't been to Istanbul, but a free entrance to the House of God is better than a paid entrance.
Secondly, Muslims have just as honestly conquered this land as Orthodox conquered the Volgo-Occa Interval, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and dropped apples on Mars.
God help!
The Jews have conquered the Holy Earth.
The Americans have conquered America.
We're gonna give it back to everyone?
You don't think there's any pagans who would want their cape back, which is where the Tenth Church is?
Thirdly, Muslims have improved the building, invested in it.
I mean, it's just like the factories and estates that the Lenin took from the bourgeois in their own possession belong to the Leninians, Putin and other nomenclatures.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to Angara, so it's all their right progressors.
The beautiful high minarets have very decorated Aya-Sofia, very much.
There was a stupid ink, and there was a stupid ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no “Islamic” or “Orthodox” civilizations.
There are those who believe, and there are hypocrites, and there are those who associate faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in categories of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of British MID Toinby official, a believer who is ashamed to think so.
And for a believer everywhere is a place of prayer.
Always.
And he who believes does not pray except from where he is asked to go, and he goes away and prays there.
He is a believer, not a advocate.
We're stakes, not glum rocks.

A Rwandan admitted to setting fire to the Cathedral in Nantes
A Rwandan who worked at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the French city of Nantes voluntarily confessed to his arson a week after the fire.
This is reported by France 3 on Sunday.
According to him, a man already detained on 19 July, the day after the fire, was again detained the previous day.
On Saturday night, he appeared before the investigating judge.
After being charged with intentional damage to property, the man admitted that he had set fire to three places - under a large body, under a small organ and in the electric shield.
He now faces up to 10 years in prison and 150,000 euros in fines.

The fire in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul took place on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters fought for a monument of Gothic architecture for several hours.

No one was injured in the incident.
The current fire is not the first in the history of the temple.
In 1972, fire destroyed his roof.
It took 13 years to deal with the consequences of that fire.

Kirilenko shared memories of games with Bryant and Jordan in the NBA
Russian Basketball Federation (RFB) head Andrey Kirilenko shared memories of his games against legendary Coby Bryant and Michael Jordan in National Basketball Association (NBA) matches.
I knew Bryant's ego couldn't be hit with some kind of clot in order not to stimulate his athletic anger.

On the set, I gave him compliments, "Oh!
Koby, good score, good pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he forgot a little bit more about taking the ball and getting 3 or 4 more points.
We've been in good contact with Koby, quotes Kirilenko's words "Evening Moscow."
He also spoke about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match, I ran in complete admiration that there was a legend next to me that I only saw on television.
As long as I had the joy of breathing, Michael scored a lot of points.
Soon I walked away from the counter, a couple of times covered his shots...
In that game, my team won and Jordan still scored 44 points," added the head of the RFB.

The interim governor of Khabarov Province, Mikhail Degtjarev, on Sunday, July 26, during a meeting with the residents of Soviet Havana, was surprised that the region was purchasing Sahelian gas, produced by the American company Exxon Neftegas, for dollars.

The authors "understood the urgency of the issues raised and did not want to offend anyone," said the American Stephen Thomas Oxner in a conversation with the publication Rise.
"I think it's a story about the power and the general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said an actor who played the father of a boy who had changed into women's clothes.
He stressed that he was "proud of work" and did not consider it to be propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he was terrified of the reaction of some people to the series' storyline: for example, there was a case where "a man in deep stump shot a shooting site and said it was all wrong."
"Then there were a couple of times when we met disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who first came with a complaint started to help us," he concluded.
The shooting incident, explains the publication, occurred in September 2019 in Cabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked a camera crew vehicle with a gun, after which he was detained by police officers.
It was previously reported that Olga Baranets, a public official for the protection of the family, had filed a complaint with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor against the more.tv service, which placed the Russian series Chiki.
The baran accused the series' creators of "promotion of nontraditional sexual relations and feminism", drawing attention to the fact that the film's main characters work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "species of physical and psychological violence."
The Ombudsman was also outraged that "the series pays much attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of a minor character.
Chicky's comedy drama tells of three prostitutes who started a new life and started a business on the advice of a friend.
