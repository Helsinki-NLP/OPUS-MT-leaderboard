Members of the Assembly of Wales do not want to “like muppets”
Among some members of the National Assembly there is dissatisfaction with the proposal to accept the acronym MWP for their name (from Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of Parliament of Wales).
A problematic solution is the plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this acronym.
A Labour member, expressing his party's opinion, expressed concern that the new acronym " rhymes Twp and Pwp".
For our readers, not from Wales: in Welsh twp means "tupica", and pwp means "cushka".
According to a member of the Assembly from the Wales Party, his organization as a whole was "dissatisfied" and offered other options.
Conservative party representatives "do not object" to the new acronym, but note that MWP is close to writing to the word Muppet (mappet).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced roughly as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting a change of name law, made the following statement: “The final decision on how the members of the Assembly will be named will, of course, remain with them”.
The Wales Administration Act 2017 authorizes the National Assembly of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Committee published a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the “Parliament of Wales” option, instead of “Assembly”, had found broad support among the local population.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the option “Members of Parliament of Wales” (Welsh Parliament Members, or WMP), while the MWP option received the greatest public support.
It seems that members of the Assembly are offering other options, but it will be difficult for the presiding member, Elin Jones, to find a satisfactory solution, recalling that the draft law on change should be submitted in a few weeks.
Reform laws would include other modifications to the Assembly ' s work process, including new rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the structure of the Committee system.
Members of the Assembly will vote in favour of the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change their country's name.
On Sunday, Macedonian residents will vote on renaming the country as the "North Macedonia Respublic".
The popular vote is intended to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek Government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims against the Greek province, and has repeatedly opposed the entry of its northern neighbour into the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Georg Ivanov, an opponent of the change of name referendum, stated that he was not going to recognize its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the name of the country is just the price of joining the EU and NATO.
Crisis in the Harlem parishes: the bells of St. Martin have been silenced forever
"Old neighborhoods I spoke to said there used to be bars and churches on every corner," Adams says.
"And now there are none left."
The disappearance of bars can still be understood:
"Communication Format Changed".
"Bar has ceased to be a kind of living room of the entire area to which regular visits have been made".
But as far as churches are concerned, the funds obtained from the sale of assets will be sufficient for a short time, however their leaders may rely on it. "They will be left with nothing sooner or later."
At the site of the church, he added, a multi-family house would appear whose tenants were unlikely to support the remaining parish area.
"Most buyers of these apartments will be white," Adams believes. "This will bring the day when such churches will finally close, because the new neighbors will never become their parishioners."
Both churches were built by white congregations even before Harlem became a black area: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's Church 10 years later.
The first parishioners of the Methodist Church left the parish in the 1930s.
Their building was purchased by a black parish located next door.
When St. Martin's Church fell into the hands of the black community, it was led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, Harlem's main commercial artery, where they refused to hire or promote the blacks.
In 1939, the building suffered significant damage as a result of the fire, and during the reconstruction work, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered a carillon installation.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson's father, who succeeded him at the head of St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon "bells for the poor".
But the expert who tried the carillon in July called it differently: "cultural heritage" and "unique historical instrument".
An expert from the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the carillon from St. Martin's Church that was the first of its kind to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. Eighteen years ago, he was invited to play a larger carillon at Riverside Church.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's church still hasn't found a replacement for him.
The last few months around St. Martin's Church have been a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by church secular leaders and others by the Diocese of the Episcopal Church.
The congregation of parishioners, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, addressed the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would "try to transfer the cost of the work" to the congregation of parishioners, although the latter had no bearing on the choice of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners expressed their dissatisfaction with the diocese's lack of transparency.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old lobster diver
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a 13-year-old diver in California was attacked by a shark and injured.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach Beach Beach in Ensignas.
As Chad Hummel told us in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego) station, he dived with friends on Saturday morning and heard the boy screams for help about half an hour later, and together with his friends, they swam by boat to the scene of the attack and dragged the young man out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he decided that the boy was very excited to catch the lobster, but quickly "found that he was screaming 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
As he approached the diver, Hummel observed that "he had completely torn the skin around the clavicle."
"I screamed for everyone to get out of the water, 'Here's the shark!'" said Hummel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Radi Children's Hospital (San Diego); his condition is assessed as critical.
The species of shark that attacked a teenager is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, reported in a press briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks ago, but was not classified as a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack suffered injuries in the upper torso area.
The authorities closed the area from Ponto Beach in Kasablad to Swami Beach in Ensinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles observed that there are 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury plans to conquer the UK perfume and cosmetics market
Seinsbury is going to install cosmetics and perfume departments in Booths, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with cosmetology consultants, based on the luxury department store model.
The UK perfume and cosmetics market is estimated at £2.8 billion and continues to expand, while the fashion and goods for the house are falling. To capture a significant portion of this desirable market as an experiment, spacious cosmetics and perfume industries will be represented throughout the country, and should they succeed next year, they should be expected in many other stores.
Supermarket owners are looking for something to fill the shelves previously placed under television, microwave ovens, goods for the home, and investments in the perfumer and cosmetic market seem to be a good solution.
According to representatives of Seinsbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetics to 3,000 items; including, for the first time, stamps such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be offered.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by the type of organization of goods in Booths stores.
In addition, the patent line of Butic Cosmetic products will be reorganized to include vegan products to meet the needs of young buyers.
Two Seinsbury stores will feature perfumed shops by Fragrance Shop: the first has already opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second is expected to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Internet commerce and the tendency to buy small quantities of products for each day in small shops near home have forced supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President of Sansbury, says that the outlet will gradually turn into a department store, and his supermarket chain is fighting for buyers in a competitive fight against cheap stores such as Aldy and Leadle, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of Sansbury supermarkets house Argos' outletes, and some of them can now be found in Habitats stores since the network acquired both stamps two years ago, resulting in increased food sales and revenues from these acquisitions.
The supermarket's previous attempts to give a new life to its cosmetic and pharmacy departments have failed.
In the early 2000s, the Seinsbury-Buts joint venture was organized, but there was further disagreement among participants over the division of profits from the sale of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Seinsbury pharmaceutical business (only 281 stores) to Celecio, owner of the Lloyds Farmasi network, for £125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a wide line of luxury skin care tools La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Says Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Seinsbury, "We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more favourable environment for our buyers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be willing to assist the board.
Our range of stamps for any taste, pleasant design, and convenient store locations will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfume, and it will be a completely new concept of shopping."
Peter Jones "wrongly" reacted to Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from the £11 million deal.
Dragon's Log Star Peter Jones is "enraged" by TV presenter Holly Willoughby's release from the £11 million deal she intended to make with Peter's Lifestyle brand, but instead chose new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their joint make of home clothes and Truly accessories.
This couple's business was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of this morning's program announced its decision in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's decision to leave their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV has angered Peter Jones, the star of the Dragon's Lough.
According to our sources, Jones was "enraged" when a televised woman during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire admitted that she would not have enough time for their common brand of Truly household clothing and accessories after new contracts of up to 1.5 million.
Their brand was compared to the child of actress Gwyneth Paltrow with the Goop brand, and her sales were expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
The 37-year-old host announced her departure in Instagram, while Jones himself left the UK on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, "Truly's mark was Holly's top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would provide her with a carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Her decision caused all the parties involved in the deal to lose ground.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, as the stamp had only a few weeks before it was launched.
At headquarters in Marlowe, there remained an entire warehouse filled with goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving this morning's host, one of the UK's most popular stars, could cost a firm a million pounds sterling because of substantial investment in goods, ranging from pillows and candles to clothes, and potential delay in launching the line.
It is also about breaking long-standing friendships.
The raising three Willoughby's children and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby created the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company's board in March.
Both couples often spend vacations together, and also Jones owns 40% of the company's TV production stock of Dan Baldwin.
Willoughby will become M&S ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as host of ITV's "I am a celebrity".
A source from Jones' close surroundings said last night, "We can't comment on his commercial affairs."
Complex negotiations, "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism with which the media would fall on him because of the "unworthy president" commentary and the positive assessment of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so many claims?
Said Trump, imitating the news anchor's voice.
"I didn't give up anything".
He noted that Kim Jong-eun was interested in re-meeting after Trump called them the first summit held in Singapore in June a significant step towards reducing nuclear weapons stockpiles in North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have reached an impasse.
Three months after the June Singapore summit, high-ranking North Korean diplomat Lee Young-ho addressed world leaders at a meeting of the UN General Assembly on Saturday, stating that North Korea is still waiting for a "relevant response" from the US after the DPRK's initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the US, noted the diplomat, continues to use sanctions as leverage.
During a gathering of his supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
"North Korea is doing great," he said. "
"We were on the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
And now we have a great relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong-un had borne fruit: the missile tests had been brought to an end, hostages had been released and United States troops remaining in the territory of the DPRK had also returned to their homeland.
Speaking of his relationship with Kim Jong-un, Trump stressed that there was nothing strange about his unusual approach to diplomacy.
"Meet yourself worthy of the president so easily, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street who are tearing into this completely crowded hall, there would be only 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd that gathered before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destruction recorded, hundreds of casualties
In the first days of the earthquake that struck Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that there was no need for their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok has lost its roof over its head, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that international support was not needed, so it was not easy," says Selina Sambang.
Save the Children is preparing a team for deployment to the House, but we do not yet know if the foreign team will be able to work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, the Indonesian leadership was conducting an assessment of the situation in the Palou in order to determine the feasibility of involving international organizations.
Given the persistent seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains horribly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite a tsunami warning, the House was not equipped with a siren to alert the population, which is most likely to have resulted in so many casualties.
Transport between numerous Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital previously moored in Lombok to assist earthquake victims is headed to Palu, but the road to a new disaster site will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo made the consolidation of Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure the main point of his election campaign and spent incalculable funds on improving roads and railroads.
However, President Joko's administration, running for a new term next year, has become mired in funding problems.
The President is also criticized for exacerbating the sectarian feud between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands more lost their homes as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other suicides.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge compares the score in a match against Chelsea with a goal in the far top corner of the gate
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from being defeated in the 89th minute of the Premier League match against Chelsea, held Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27 metres from Chelsea Gate when his team lost 1-0.
He shifted to the left and ran into the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and ended up in the long top of the grid.
Golquiper Kepa Arrisabalag jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com's website, Starridge said, "The whole thing was to get in that position and get the ball, players like Shak always play the most of the attack, so I just wanted to give myself as much time as possible."
"I saw Kante heading towards me, took over the ball and briefly thought, ran through the gate".
At the end of the first half of the match, Chelsea's team ran 1-0, a 25th-minute goal scored by Belgian Eden Azar.
The central attacker Chelsea, passing the pass back to Mateo Kovacicchu, broke half of Liverpool through the middle of the field.
In the middle of the field, Kovačić played a single touch game.
He went on to pass to Azar, who went out to the gate.
Azar beat the defense and struck off the left flank, bypassing goalkeeper Alison Becker's Liverpool, hitting the far corner of the grid.
Liverpool will meet with the Napoli team at the Champions League group stage. The match will take place at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA Euroleague match to be held Thursday in London, also at 3:00 p.m.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami rose to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and the ensuing tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, as reported by the National Disaster Management Authority on Sunday morning.
Under the rubble of buildings destroyed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale, a large number of people were reportedly left behind; the earthquake occurred on Friday and caused a tsunami with waves up to 6 metres high, and was reported by Suthopo Purvo Nugroho, an official spokesman for the Office during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000 people, was devastated by the wreckage of the collapsed houses.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
A woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside County this morning, and a murder investigation is under way.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 at the Grayson Muse compound on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder of local residents.
Says Inspector O'Haygen of the Criminal Police: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I strongly ask everyone who was in the John Street area of Birkenhead and could observe or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have captured something on the video recorder, and please contact us with any information that might help the investigation."
A police official confirmed that the victim had lived in Birkenhead and that her body had been found inside the compound.
This afternoon, alleged acquaintances of the victims arrived at the scene to ask their questions about where it was discovered this morning.
An investigation is under way and police officers are preparing to report the tragedy to the victim ' s next of kin.
A taxi driver living in the Grayson Muse compound attempted to enter his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he learned of what had happened, he lost his ability to speak.
Residents were told that they would not be able to get home for at least a few hours.
One police officer told the tenant that the entire surrounding area was considered the scene of the crime.
One woman cried.
"What a horror!" she repeated.
At 2 p.m., two police buses arrived at the scene and another remained outside the fenced area.
A few policemen were put inside the fence to watch the apartment complex.
All those who have any information are asked to send a personal message to @MerPOLCC on Twitter, to call 101 or to call Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111 (case 247, September 30).
Cromwell's memorial in front of Parliament sparked a fierce debate about "writing history"
Cromwell's "exile" would be a well-deserved retaliation for the barbaric destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England by his followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memorial Society called Mr. Creek's proposal "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, stated, "As part of the ongoing debate about the demolition of historical monuments, the issue of Oliver Cromwell's statue in front of Westminster Palace inevitably arose.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the iconic movement during the English civil wars.
Oliver Cromwell is probably suffering for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived forever before.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by author Sir William Hamo Tornikcroft reflects the opinion of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historic achievements of a man whom many still regard as worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith stated, "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell a defender of Parliament from external pressure, in his case the monarchy.
Whether this view is historically accurate remains a subject of debate among specialists.
But it can be said with certainty that the conflict that erupted in the mid-17th century affected the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical person representing one side of this section.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve praise and respect."
A Chinese farmer was devoured to death by a killer pig.
In a market in southwestern China, the farmer was the victim of a pig, local media reports.
The victim's bloody body (only his last name, "Yuan"), with a torn artery, was found near a flat on the market in Lupanshui County, Guizhou Province, southern China, as reported by the Morning Post on Sunday.
Pig husband prepares to inoculate pigs on pig farm, May 30, 2005, Sinin district of Qinghai Province of China.
Yuan and his cousin came from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, his cousin discovered Yuan's breathing body, with the door to the nearby piglet open.
There was a huge cart in the piglet with blood on it.
The forensic examination found that a pig weighing 250 kilograms had swallowed the farmer to death.
"My brother's feet were bloodied and mutilated," told the Guyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the victim.
The surveillance video showed Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been isolated in a separate fence during the investigation, to avoid repeated attacks.
Yuan's family is reportedly negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the farmer's death.
Porcine attacks on people are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in the American state of Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound animal nailed a Welsh farmer to a tractor and let him go, only fearing his wife.
In 2012, a farmer from Oregon in the United States was reported to have been eaten by his own pigs. As one Canadian farmer told CBC News, pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can affect their hidden aggression as a "climbing mechanism".
"The pigs are playing,
They are biting and very curious, but they have no purpose to offend you.
You just need to instil in your animals a sense of measure and respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rain to a large part of the Southwest United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa loses power by moving through an area with cooler water to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days it will bring rain and flooding to the territory of northern Mexico and the Southwest of the United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. on New York City, the cyclone reached category 1 with winds up to 135 km/h, being 360 km south-west of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone is beginning to emerge over the Pacific Ocean, which will move eastward to the western coast of the United States, and as the storm approaches the coast of Baja California, it will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico, into the Southwest.
On Monday, more than 25 cm of rainfall is expected in Mexico.
Under the influence of tropical humidity in the emerging low-pressure zone, heavy rains are expected in the coming days in the Southwest.
Landfalls ranging from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous storm floods, mudfalls, and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially southern Nevada and Arizona, due to high tropical air humidity, rainfall rates can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In parts of the southwest of the United States, mostly in most of Arizona, up to 5–10 cm of rainfall is expected.
The risk of sudden rapidly developing floods is not ruled out because of the uneven distribution of tropical rains.
At the risk of tropical rain, walking in the desert has serious consequences.
Livneys can turn canyons into stormy rivers, and thunder can cause wind surges and raise dust clouds.
With the emergence of a low-pressure zone, rains will collapse on the coast of southern California.
It is possible to fall to 1.5 cm of rainfall, which can cause small mudstone flows and create slippery surfaces on roads.
These are the first rainfalls since the start of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday night and morning, there will be tropical rains in Arizona that will spread to other territories by Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday, the rains will take place in the Four Corners area and last until Wednesday night.
In October, there will be sharp temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, due to low Arctic air temperatures at fairly high tropical temperatures.
This combination sometimes leads to severe temperature fluctuations in a small area.
Such sharp temperature fluctuations will be particularly noticeable in the central United States on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 20 degrees between temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and in Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other territories.
In most of the central and eastern U.S. territories, warm weather is expected in early October, and temperatures will be as high as 27 degrees from the South Plains to the Northeast.
In New York City, air temperatures can rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises with a high probability of unusually high temperatures on the eastern coast of the United States until mid-October.
The Senate hearing in the case of Judge Brett Cavanaugh examined more than 20 million spectators
The testimony of Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blazy Ford, who accuses Cavanaugh of an attempted rape in the 1980s, caught the attention of over 20 million viewers of six television channels on Thursday.
The political standoff over the confirmation of Cavanaugh's candidacy was followed by an unexpected follow-up. On Friday, there was an urgent media announcement that Republican Jeff Flake had made the condition that charges against a lawyer should be investigated by the FBI within one week.
As Ford stated at the Senate Law Committee hearings, she's on "100 percent" confident that Cavanaugh was intoxicated and attacked her and tried to strip her at a school party.
Cavanaugh gave emotional testimony, stating that he was 100 per cent sure that it had not happened.
According to Nielsen's research agency, the Friday debate was watched by more than 20.4 million spectators.
The agency took into account average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the audience of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen's rating does not always take into account viewers watching TV at work.
In comparison, it is the average audience that follows the American football match in the playoffs or the Oscar Awards ceremony.
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose leading strongly supported Cavanaugh's appointment: the Senate hearings, which lasted all day, watched an average of 5.69 million viewers, reported by Nielsen.
In second place, ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS's audience was 3.1 million, NBC's 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, Nielsen reports.
After the hearings, the interest in the case has not diminished.
On Friday, there was a real drama featuring Jeff Flake.
After the Arizona senator, considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support Cavanaugh's candidacy, CNN and CBS television stations managed to capture the camera as Flake encountered in the elevator on Friday morning on his way to a meeting of the Legal Committee with a group of activists who had criticized the senator.
The whole world saw him drop his eyes and get a kick out of angry women live on CNN.
"I stand before you," one of them said.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
"The power behind you, while so many women are powerless," tried to explain the woman's position.
Flake responded to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would speak on the subject at the committee meeting, and the elevator doors closed by hiding the senator from all-embracing cameras.
When a few hours later the Law Committee was preparing to confirm Cavanaugh's candidacy for the post of judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all television channels broadcast the meeting live.
However, Flake set one condition — that the FBI investigates these allegations against the candidate by next week, as the democratic minority sought.
Flake claims to have changed his mind thanks to the intervention of a friend, Democrat Senator Chris Koons.
He made the final decision, talking to Kuns and several other senators.
Flake's decision had an effect because it was obvious that Republicans lacked the votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
By decree of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses his critics of "political games" around the Brexit situation
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused politicians critical of her plan to leave the European Union of putting partisan interests ahead of the public interest.
The British Prime Minister arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published on one page of May's interview, former MFA head Boris Johnson criticized her so-called "Shashki" plan within Brexit, stating that he considered the introduction of customs duties between Britain and the EU "absolutely ridiculous".
Wade Sims' death in a shootout: Police arrested Dyon Simpson on suspicion of murdering a forward at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of a shootout by Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for Louisiana State University.
According to Baton Rouge police, 20-year-old Dyon Simpson was arrested and detained on second-degree murder charges.
Police released a video recording of a fight involving Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, a CBS regional channel, police found Simpson's DNA on glasses found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to fatally injuring Wade.
According to Advocate, a bond of $350,000 has been set for Simpson.
The Coroner of the Eastern District of Baton Rouge issued a preliminary detention on Friday: the death was caused by a cross-cutting combination of a gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Division, the state police forensics laboratory, the Southern University police and local residents who assisted in the search operations leading to the detention.
Joe Allewa, Director of Sports, Louisiana State University, thanked the law enforcement forces for their "good faith work in catching a criminal".
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-metre forward was native to Baton Rouge; his father Wayne also played on the Louisiana State University team.
In the last season, Sims averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying that Wade Sims' tragic death caused "shock" and "real grief" to all players.
"That's what I've always been afraid of," the coach added.
The volcano covered the ashes of Mexico City.
The Vulcan of Popocatepetl fell asleep ash in the southern vicinity of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre of Mexico recommended that the population should not approach the volcano: its crater had been active and 183 steam-gas emissions had been produced in a 24-hour period.
According to the Center's observations, the volcano was often throbbed and shivered.
In some parts of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko, social media users published photographs of the windshields of cars covered with a thin layer of ash.
After an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 Mw, rocking the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded increased volcanic activity 72 kilometres south-east of the capital.
Vulcan Popocatepetl (or, for his own, Don Goyo) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists in the lead-up to the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, a thousands of rallies were held in Barcelona to mark the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which divided the country into two camps, with clashes between the pro-independence and the police; six of the rioters were detained.
Police repulsed pro-independence protesters, while the latter, wearing black masks, threw eggs and powder paint at the guards, raising clouds of dark dust in the heart of Barcelona.
After the police used batons to contain the crowd, the riots resumed with renewed force.
For several hours, supporters of independence chanted, "We will not forget, we will not forgive!" and their opponents responded to them with the slogan, "Long live Spain!".
According to local press reports, fourteen members of the action were hospitalized with light injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which was declared illegal by the Spanish Government, but was an important milestone for the separatists, and a year later, tensions persisted in a region that aspired to sovereignty.
Catalonia, with a huge margin, voted to withdraw from Spain, but the turnout was low due to opposition to the exit mostly boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to block the referendum in the country's polling stations.
On Friday, the separatists stayed overnight on the stated route of a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration still took place, but it went on another route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who attended a separatist rally in his wife's company, laments that the hope of Catalonia acquiring sovereignty is becoming increasingly strained.
“Last year, one of the most important events in our lives occurred.
My parents cried with happiness, having been able to vote in a referendum, and today we are in a suspended state," he says.
In the recent December local elections, the Catalan pro-Spanish parties had won an important victory, albeit with a small margin, but this year their movement was losing supporters, as many of the prominent leaders of the movement were either on the run or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic recording a police support rally on the phone, said the conflict was fuelled by both sides of the political spectrum.
"The tension is rising," he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junkeras, one of the nine leaders of Catalan separatists who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
"Participation in regular elections to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government," he says.
Londonderry: The car crashed into the house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the houses in Londonberry was rammed several times by a car; men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested.
The attack took place on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time in the Ballinagard Crescent area.
As a result of the ram, the gates and the building itself were damaged, and criminal investigation inspector Bob Blammings reports.
There are reports that an onion shot might have been fired into the car.
Livingston's victory over Rangers thanks to Menga's mark goal
Dolly Menga's first goal brought a guaranteed victory to the Livingstone team.
Thanks to the scored ball, the Livingstone won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the head coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerrard, this is only the second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's exact strike equalled Gary Holt's team with Hibernian in the credit table, where they share second place.
The Gerrard Club did not have a win on the exit this season of the Premier League. On Sunday, they will meet with the leaders of the group, the Harts, from whom the Rangers are eight points behind.
On Thursday, the Rangers will host a European League match with the Austrian club Rapid (Vienna).
The Livingstone Club continues its win-win series in the division, playing six games and not receiving any defeats since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's head coach.
Missing moments for Livingstone in a fight with assertive guests
Holt's wards had to keep the score from the start – the Rangers clearly failed their insistence.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the defense line, but the goal of his weak attempt failed, and then defender Alan Litgow, swinging too wide, failed to prevent Keig Halkett's ball from getting into the grid.
The host side allowed the Rangers to play ahead of their defense line, counting on dangerous moments when the game resumed.
That's how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers gave way to a free kick, and Livingstone took the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made the Menga transfer, which scored from a central position.
By then, the Rangers were superior to the ball possession, but the host team's protection was impenetrable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second half continued along the same pattern, although Kelly still had to repel the blow from Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked the ball off Scott Pittman, and Litgow made a wide pitch out of standard position.
The balls were constantly inducted into the Livingstone penalty, but all the attacks were reflected, and the two penalty requirements – one for provoking the backup player Glenn Middleton Halkett and the other after the game hand – were not met.
"Livingstone's phenomenal game" - analysis
From BBC Scotland - Alasder Lamont, report from Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal game and excellent result for the team Livingstone.
Absolutely all players were great and once again surpassed all expectations, continuing their climb to football Olympus.
Their style and composition have hardly changed since their climb to the top of the ratings, and the great merit of Coach Holt is that he has mobilized this team from the start.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Hulkett managed an excellently organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warall from relaxing.
However, the Rangers could never enter the rhythm.
Although they had good game moments with Coach Gerrard, this time they fell short of our expectations.
In the last minutes of the match, they lacked ball ownership, and they only managed to get through the host team's protection once. The Rangers, which dropped to the middle of the table, has much to think about.
Erdoğan's cool reception during a visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast, the weather was beautiful, and both of the top faces were in a great mood.
This was the last day of President Erdoğan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO member countries, a visit that already involved some conflicts.
Heads of country failed to find understanding on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey ' s accession to the EU.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to attend the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a 25,000-strong crowd from entering the mosque, but many Erdoğan supporters were stationed nearby to see their president.
Opponents of the Erdoğan regime, including Kurds, gathered in the same place to fully condemn both Erdoğan's policies and the decision of the German government to invite him to visit Germany.
The existence of radically opposed views at the meeting reflects the ambiguous nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots extol Erdoğan, while others regard him as a tyrant.
Deptford Road Accident: A car collision resulted in the death of a cyclist
In London, the car ran into a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy junction in the southeastern part of the city of Depfort, at around 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car and the ambulances who arrived tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without regaining consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just a mile and a half away from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver had escaped.
The London Police report that the identification of the deceased and the notification of his next of kin are under way.
In the meantime, roads have been blocked at the scene and buses have been rerouted: motorists are asked not to enter the area.
Long-Lartin Prison disorder: six police officers injured
According to the Long-Lartin administration, six police officers were injured during riots in a high-security men ' s prison.
In the Long-Lartin (Wustershire) men's maximum security prison, riots have continued since Sunday, tying up around 09:30 local time.
The tornado task force was called in to suppress the riots involving eight prisoners from one wing.
The police suffered minor injuries to the soft tissue of the face and were treated locally.
According to the official spokesman of the prison, “specially trained officers were recruited to resolve the incident at Long-Lartin Correctional Institution.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their preventive measure may be changed for a longer period.”
Long Lartin currently holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had been hospitalized by a prisoner.
And last October, the prison authorities were forced to call in special units to calm the burgeoning prisoners who threw pool balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa could flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (which would benefit the drylands)
Arizona rarely enters the area of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time has been "lucky": at the beginning of the following week, Hurricane Rosa, having made the last leap, must pass over the desert part of the Southwest and bring with her the risk of storm floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of storm floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, in southeastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and shed a storm on Monday night.
The Bureau of the National Meteorological Service in Phoenix tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status, being within a 320 km radius of Phoenix, since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the Arizona border".
According to recent forecasts by the National Meteorological Service, it will fall between 5 and 10 cm of rainfall, reaching 15 cm in places on the Arizona Mogollon-Rome plateau.
In other desert regions of the Southwest, such as the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, possibly falling up to 2.5–5 cm of rainfall, precipitation areas can reach up to 10 cm.
For areas that will be bypassed by storm surges, the rain brought by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, as the region has long suffered from drought.
While storm floods may be dangerous, heavy rains can ease the dry season not taking place in the Southwest of the United States.
According to U.S. Drop Monitor maps, more than 40% of Arizona's territory has at least a severe drought (second in gravity)," reports Weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Mexican state of Baja California.
As of Sunday morning, a hurricane with a maximum speed of 137 km/h is 360 km south of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane found itself in an area with cooler water on the Pacific coast and thus losing its strength.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of "tropical storm".
In some parts of Mexico, heavy flooding is expected to occur.
"In territories from Lower California to northwest Sonora may fall to 7–10 cm rainfall, places to 25 cm," reports Weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa then heads north through Mexico and early Tuesday morning will reach the Arizona border in the tropical cyclone category, from Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday evening.
"The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rose and its remnants is from severe rainstorms in Lower California, in the northwestern part of Sonora, and in desert areas in the southwest of the United States," reports the National Meteorological Service.
Rainfalls are expected to cause dangerous storm floods, mudfalls in the desert and possible landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four suspects detained for attempted murder
In Somerset, a 16-year-old boy was seriously stabbed and three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy were detained on suspicion of attempted murder.
The victim was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at around 4 a.m. on Saturday morning.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as "stable".
The same evening, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area, reported by Avon County Police and Somerset.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the crime who have any video of the incident on their mobile phone.
Donald Trump: "On Cavanaugh "all hatred, all malice" of Democrats has fallen"
"Voice for Judge Cavanaugh is a voice against ruthless and outrageous tactics applied by Democrats," Trump stated at a rally of his associates in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, in the process of approving Cavanaugh's nomination for the candidate, "all hatred, all malice" of the Democratic Party collapsed.
On Thursday, Cavanaugh testified before the U.S. Congress, in his emotional treatment categorically rejecting the accusation of Christine Blazy Ford that he sexually abused her more than 30 years ago when both were teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during the prosecution hearing.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that that day "the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage" of Cavanaugh.
"Voice for Justice Cavanaugh's confirmation is a vote for the approval of one of the most distinguished lawyers of our time, with an unscathed government record," announced the president to a crowd of his associates in West Virginia state.
In his speech, the President implicitly raised the issue of Cavanaugh's nomination, referring to the importance of Republicans appearing for election to Congress and the House of Representatives.
"There are only five weeks left in our lives until the most important elections.
I'm not in them, but I'm in a race in another way," he said.
"I wear like a stubble and fight for our excellent candidates".
Trump believes that the Democrats have set themselves the task of "resisting us with all their strength."
By regulation, the first key Senate vote to confirm Cavanaugh is due to take place no later than Friday, as reported by the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party.
The earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives, and the total number of casualties continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had died, and many had been swept away by the giant waves that had taken over the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which had been hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the storm were hundreds of guests of the beach festival in the city of Palou. On Friday, at sunset, waves almost six metres high swept away and led to the immediate death of many of those present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When a storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach rest instead of running into shelter immediately, and consequently lost their lives," reported Suthopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Authority during a press conference held in Jakarta.
"Tsunami did not come alone, in the water stream there were cars, logs, whole houses, nature destroyed everything in its way," explained Nugroho, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at 497 km/h and hit the coast with all its strength.
Some of those present have climbed the trees, saving their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
The aerial photography of the disaster management department shows destroyed houses, shops, collapsed bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still rocking underground.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
A statement by the Technology Assessment and Use Agency of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) states that the energy released by the earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected due to the geographic location of the city at the end of the long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage "large-scale", adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
Under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, the bodies of the dead were found; a total of 540 people were injured, and another 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho added that the casualties and destruction could be even greater along the coast to 300 km from Palu, in the site of Dungala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications with Dungal were "fully destroyed, no information was received".
"There are over 300,000 people living in the Dungala area," reports the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers have already gone to the disaster zone.
"There has been a tragedy, but that is not the limit," says the report.
On Saturday, the Authority was severely criticized for failing to report a tsunami to Palou in time, but authorities believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
On social media, an amateur video appeared in which a man on the top floor of the building shouts about an impending tsunami, desperately trying to attract people's attention on the street.
A few minutes later, a wall of water falls on the shore, carrying entire houses and cars.
Reuters' agency has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
Earthquake and tsunami caused major electrolysis, causing the loss of communications in the Pala, making the rescue operations of the services very difficult.
Military humanitarian transport aircraft were dispatched from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated population still lacks food and basic necessities, as reported by government sources.
The city airport was only open for humanitarian assistance; it will be closed to other flights until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision charity arrived safely from Dungala to Palu, where staff found shelter in tarp tents broken up in the yard of their office building.
"They saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charitable organizations have begun to put in place humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that international NCBs have failed to reach Pala.
Indonesian law allows for funding, humanitarian assistance and foreign workers only after declaring the site of the disaster as a national disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is believed to be a local disaster," reports Aulia Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares a natural disaster to be national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but for the time being the status remains unchanged."
On the second day after the natural disaster that rocked Pala, the friends and relatives of the people listed as missing still hope for their wonderful salvation, which will restore the public's faith in the best.
On Saturday, a little boy fell into a sewer hatch was rescued.
On Sunday, rescuers removed a woman from the debris of the building who spent two days there, next to her mother's breathing body.
Handon Subando, an Indonesian national paraplanerism coach, trained two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel included his students, including Mandaga.
"I'm not the last person in this sport, and it's emotionally hard to survive," he said.
Handon recalls how, after learning the collapse of Roa Roa's hotel from other paraplaners, he desperately tried to contact WhatsApp for the next hours with his Palu colleagues resting at the beach festival.
However, his messages were displayed with one gray tick, not two blue.
"This means that the messages were not delivered," he believes.
A daring theft of $26,750 while maintaining an ATM in Newport-on-Livy
On Friday morning, the intruders stole $26,750 from the Bank's collector, who runs one of the ATMs in Newport-on-Livey, says in a press release of the Newport Police.
According to investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored minibus took cash from the ATM located in the entertainment complex and was going to fill it with new banknotes.
At that time, "at the staff member Link's, the perpetrator ran from the back" and stole a bag of banknotes to refuel the ATM.
According to witnesses to the incident, several suspects had fled the scene, but the police had not indicated the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information about these individuals are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West came up with a new name: Ye.
He announced this on Saturday Twitter, "Personality formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been wearing this pseudonym for a long time and has even put it in the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news of this came in advance of Kanye's appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he plans to introduce his new album Yandi.
Kanye West will co-host Ariana's singer, who cancelled due to "emotional experiences," reports the broadcaster.
West had previously stated that the pseudonym was not only an abbreviated version of his name, but also had a religious meaning.
"Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means 'you', 'you'," so West explained the title of his album in a recent interview to radio host Big Boy.
"I mean, I'm you, I'm us.
At first there was Kanye, which means "only," and now I'm just Ye, which is a reflection of all the good, the bad, the incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to think about who we are."
Kanye is not the first famous rapper to decide to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or simply Diddy, this year asked to call himself Love ("love") or Brasa Love ("Brother Love" or "Brother Love").
Speaking with West rapper JZ, he also changed his name several times, with a hyphen and no, capital letters or lowercases.
The President of Mexico solemnly pledges not to use military force against the civilian population
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which ended in a bloody clash.
Speaking on Saturday at Tlatello Square, President López Obrador promised "never to resort to the army to suppress the Mexican people."
At this site on October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired at the crowd and a massacre began, killing 300 people, against the background of the intensification of left-wing student movements in Latin America.
López Obrador also pledged support to Mexican youth in the form of a monthly study scholarship and the opening of more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people directly into the criminal world.
The US needs to double funding for AI development.
China and its efforts in artificial intelligence (I.I.S.) should not be underestimated — the US should double investment in its scientific development, considering Lee Kaifa, an investor and entrepreneur in AI development with Google, Microsoft, and Apple experience.
Earlier, several U.S. ministries had made statements about AI, although the U.S. as a whole did not have a clear strategy for AI development.
At the same time, China presented its own plan as early as last year: its goal is to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we look forward to the next breakthrough in AI," Lee says.
An increase in funding could double the chances that the next big AI achievement would be made in the US, told Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most outstanding AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the highest player in American Othello, and then he was head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese affiliate.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Robotics Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would take place to help find people with nontraditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
"China absorbs academic leaders, but corporations," Lee is convinced.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring light from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the US develop artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence," he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of next generation artificial intelligence.
China's National Science Foundation provides funding to scientists in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Lee claims.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the United Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced investing $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has taken no action in this direction for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change a country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to “Republic of North Macedonia”, which would resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and vetoed its membership in NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments concluded an agreement based on the proposal of a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether voter turnout would meet the 50 per cent minimum required for the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was worded as follows: “Do you support NATO and EU membership, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the dissolution of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver of George, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of Members of Parliament stated that they would respect the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive, although it was not legally binding.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority of the members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 1:00 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," says 62-year-old Yose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško voted for a referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country, which will pave the way for her joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkuk, 54, prepared a small scene, setting up chairs in front of tents set by those citizens who are about to boycott the referendum.
"We are for membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with a high-headed head, rather than inhabiting the threshold of the official cabinets," Kawadarkov says.
"Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of self-esteem.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring the investments in Macedonia that are so needed in that country, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favor because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be “a deposit of our well-being”.
A survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum, but that was below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom-TV revealed that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of this number claims to vote positively.
For the referendum to take place, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The collapse of the referendum will be the first major blow to the pro-Western Government's policy since it came to power last May.
Look: Sergio Aguiero of Manchester City bypasses Brighton's defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling killed Brighton's defense, bringing Manchester City to a 2–0 victory on Saturday at Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute, it seemed to him it was no bother.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker received a pass in the center of the field.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before breaking into an open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green T-shirts.
He bypassed one defender and beat several more on the edge of the Brighton penalty zone.
He went on to pass the ball to Sterling on the left.
An English attacker, while in the penalty zone, returned to one touch the Aguero ball, which hit Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan in the right corner of the gate with his right foot.
"Aguero has some leg problems," stated a Manchester City coach, Pep Guardiola, to journalists.
"We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blue an initial advantage in the Premier League's struggle.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game, Aguero received the ball, being deep in Brighton territory
He gave a great cutting gear on the left flank on Leroy Sana.
Sane made a few touches before giving Sterling a hand-over to a distant pant.
The attacker of the Sky Blues scored the ball at the gate just before flying out of the field.
Manchester City fought Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 on Rhine-Nekkar Aren in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer's going to take the glasses away from Colorado Rockies.
After the Washington Nationals dropped out of the playoffs battle, there was no particular reason to force events.
But the tireless Sherzer hopes to win the fight against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, ahead of one Los Angeles Dodgers game in the Western Division, will have problems in the playoffs.
The 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night the Rockys have already won at least 7 or 8th place, but they still hope to secure a title in the first division.
"And although we play for no reason, at least we can hold positions knowing the immense significance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of viewers and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss this?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a pitcher for Sunday, but according to recent data, in the current situation, they tend to put Sherzer on that role.
Sherzer, who is about to go out for 34th game, threw the ball on Thursday at the pitcher's pitcher venue, and on Sunday, on his weekend, he will be pitcher.
Washington right pitcher statistics are 18-7 with an ERA rating of 2.53 and 300 outs in 220 2/3 innings in the current season.
Trump is running a campaign in West Virginia.
Referring to the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections, the President implicitly referred to the situation around Brett Cavanaugh, a presidential candidate for the Supreme Court.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's very, very important. I don't run, although I really run, fighting everywhere for good candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by whatever means they need, and we're seeing scoundrel and abomination.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to cross to get power and control, that's what they want — power and control, but we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he claims, set out to "resist and obstruct."
"And you've been watching this for the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "wicked, mean, nasty, and lying."
He referred to the Senate Law Committee, referring to Democratic Senator Diane Finestein, causing loud calls from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the contents of this document to leak?
Uh, uh, what document?
No, no, the language of the body gave it away, I've never seen the language of the body so disprove words."
The Labour Party is no longer an organization of different views.
She does not tolerate those who express their opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party proposed a vote of no confidence in me, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I am the last Labour Party Member of Parliament who has not yet been told that we are not welcome for expressing our views.
A similar attitude towards my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by a vote of no confidence for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, Europe — ironically, these are issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham Eastern Labour Meeting notice on Friday said that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the time out of my eight years as a local Labour Party Member of Parliament, the GC evening Friday meetings were just like this.
Unfortunately, today's tone does not match those many meetings, and the promise of “more human and softer” politics has long been forgotten, if ever.
The fact that there are no differences of opinion in the Labour Party is becoming more and more evident, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues, whose political perspective I had previously considered to be similar to my own, began to expect that I would fundamentally change my views and take positions that I would never agree to — whether national security or EU single market issues.
Whenever I speak publicly — and no matter what I say — there is a tirade of insults on social media calling for the cancellation of elections condemning the centre’s policies, or claiming that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just happening to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments to me do tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those of my colleagues who face a daily stream of sexual or racist attacks, but who never retreat.
What is most disappointing about this policy is that such a number of insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin stated that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that "widespread church," and with every vote of mistrust or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes already.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations calling on me to sit down and cut my words, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I came to politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago, as a student of the school outraged by the contempt of thatcher government, which literally caused my school class to break up, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those most in need — be it the work of a local deputy or government minister.
I've never concealed my political views, I didn't do it in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and spheres in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say the following: our country is moving so hard towards Brexit, which will guarantee economic, industrial and State losses, and I do not understand the will of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of abrogation or political expediency will prevent me from acting as I see fit in your interests.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East County
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Air comes first
Two late attempts may have slightly distorted the final result, but Air no doubt earned a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Tennent Premier League match.
Now they're leading the table, the only undefeated team of ten.
After all, all because of their excellent protection as well as their ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Merchi a full right to be pleased.
"All this time we've been tested for strength, and we're still undefeated, so I have no reason to be sad," Peter Merchi commented.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "It's worth giving to Er, they've done better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, carried out by Fraser Climo, brought Air forward, but a yellow card released for the game by Voorors to Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to step forward, and Jason Baggott grabbed on an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Air's withdrawal from the penalty before, in the middle of the game, earning a point, and then, during the break, implemented a single attempt, making an score of 17-5 in favour of Air.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, realized by Buggot, reduced the break to five points.
Then there was a long hiatus due to the serious injury to Rouarid Knott, who received a sprain, and after re-release, Er advanced further due to Stafford McDowell's attempt at Climo's realization.
Current Air captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced rivals to pay another player for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
Nevertheless, the owners returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climo without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the advancing moth "Er".
Climo realized the advantage, not stopping almost from returning, after Kyle Rowe was hit by David Armstrong and sent the extreme attacker Gregor Henry to a fifth attempt by the field owners.
Still Game star is going to start a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran is about to start working in the hotel industry: he was reportedly appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show to which he writes the script, and is filmed along with a long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemfile.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth episode would be the last on the show, and it appears that Kirnan plans to live after Craigling.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although Scottish Sun's source hinted that Kirnan planned to participate in the "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
“Our Sea”: landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way back to the Pacific Ocean
Seafarers patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue flags on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are described with the slogan, "The sea is ours.
It is our duty to return it."
Throughout Bolivia, which is landlocked, there is still a memory of the coastline lost to Chile as a result of the bloody 19th-century conflict over resources; a lively and eager to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have been the bravest in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the international court on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
"Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and mental balance and, of course, there is a positive outcome here," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will witness the decision-making process before the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the tribunal at The Hague will be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign landlocked Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is fighting a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also anxiously awaiting a decision to be delivered on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he argued in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to take a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if it does, it will make little difference.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands had no power to administer Chilean territory and had already stated that it would have no influence on the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the judgment of the International Court of Justice was delivered only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case was “not complex”, says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The case of Bolivia has not progressed in the past four years, but on the contrary has been delayed all along.
"The current administration of Bolivia used the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes," Zarate says.
According to her, Morales' militant rhetoric destroyed the last Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to conduct discussions afterwards.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not agree that the court's decision had been rendered too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of mutual benefit disagreement," he argues.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, uses the naval issue as a political bargaining chip.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he claims.
"The judgment of the court is an opportunity to see once again that we have to step over our past".
North Korea states that there will be no nuclear disarmament until it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho states that his country will never destroy its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made at the Singapore summit among its leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of resuming deadlocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri argues: the dream that long sanctions and US objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever bring the North to its knees is a utopia.
Washington fears to adopt this declaration if Pyongyang does not take substantive steps towards disarmament before.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But skepticism that Pyongyang takes seriously the abandonment of an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows show the latest line of massive headdresses that promise to appear in mass sale and will be worn right next to you
If you want to add hats to your collection or to protect yourself completely from the sunlight, there's no need to look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a mass of unusual headdresses that are part of their SS19 collection and blinded visitors to Fashion Week in Paris.
This summer, highly impractical hats won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their stunning creations to the podium.
Valentino's distinguished specimen: the head beige, decorated with broad featherlike fields, painted on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included precious watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even pineapple, but all these headdresses are not designed to warm their heads in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of fancy masks, which had to be very close to the statue on Halloween's eve.
Many of these pristine masks had their mouth sewn, and they resembled the portrait of Hannibal Lector more than the creation from the coutures.
One of the copies resembled underwater equipment with a tube and protective glasses, and the other was melted ice cream.
If you're a fan of high fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of breaking into a mass sale – right to you.
The hats of enormous size follow the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with two-foot wide fields that everyone else has worn, from Rianna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult label that released this highly unpractical hat, which gained such wide popularity on social media, spawned and sent out another huge accessory, a straw beach bag, almost as large as the model wearing the bathing suit itself carrying the bag.
The orange bag from the burned Rafia with a white leather pen and a border from the Rafia was a vivid specimen of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on Fashion Week in Paris.
Selebrew stylist Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: "I think big hats and beach bags will appear in mass sale next summer. As the designer has produced such fury with his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories."
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world
Scottish independent schools continue the tradition of brilliant education, which was reaffirmed in 2018: outstanding examination results have demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other socially important disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), with more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, and aim to provide the highest level of services for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their career choices, and the status of citizens of the world.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for designing and implementing an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you call to his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, you turn to his heart."
This is a strong indication that we cannot rely solely on English if we are to build relationships with and trust citizens of other countries.
From this year ' s latest examinations, we see languages taking the lead in league tables and having the highest score in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages received the highest "A" rating.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students received "A" in Mandarin (Normary Chinese), while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish also received "A".
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland, foreign languages are clearly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
Language subjects are now in the same demand as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that, among the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill vacancies, 17 per cent was due to language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession the student chooses, if he learns a second language, in the future he will receive a real advantage by learning another additional skill that will be useful for him throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows more than one foreign language a competitive advantage.
According to a YouTube survey in which more than 4,000 adult British participated in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak well enough in foreign language to support the conversation, and French proved to be the only two-digit language spoken by 15 per cent of respondents.
That is why investing in language education is so relevant now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
Scotland's schools have quite a variety of languages that are taught — each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important to Britain in the light of the country's future development until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests may be, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with teaching staff whose members are specialists in these languages.
Scottish independent schools seek to create an environment of learning that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to achieve success, regardless of the future they face.
At present, it cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, languages continue to be vital to the future development of the country, so that this should be appropriately reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages need to be seen as “skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, which provides diversity and benefits for Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards, Director, Board of Independent Schools of Scotland
Lebron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The pernicious expectation of fans to see Lebron James perform for the first time at the Los Angeles Lakers almost came to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in a preseason Sunday match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it remains to be seen how much time he has to play.
"More than one and less than forty-eight," Walton replied on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games on the Lakers schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to prepare for the season," the player replies.
Trump selection race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five scheduled Trump meetings next week, including a visit to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on his candidate for the post of supreme judge was postponed, Trump seeks support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if a vote is held in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia meeting tonight, and how can we watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting with West Virginia voters online on a live YouTube broadcast.
Trump is likely to speak at the hearings this week to nominate his candidate, Brett Cavanaugh, for the post of supreme judge, and Trump's offer of this candidate has given rise to a lot of negative reactions, as Cavanaugh was charged with sexual harassment, and the vote to be held in the Senate will be postponed for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this action is to help the Republicans entering the November election to increase the pace of the election.
Thus, President Trump's campaign is aimed at ensuring that the five meetings to be held next week help "activate volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters writes.
"Control of Congress is so important for its subpoena that the president should visit as many states as possible, as we enter a tense campaign season," Trump campaign spokesperson who refused to be named reports Reuters.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can attract supporters from "... Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract Pittsburgh media attention," reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump's visit to West Virginia this Saturday is the second visit to this state in the last month, because it was here that he gained an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the polls.
"The fact that in order for Morrisy to start ahead of the poll competitors, the president has to come is not a good sign for Morrisy himself," says Simon Heder, a political scientist from the University of West Virginia (quotate from Reuters).
The 2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team demonstrates readiness to fight and nurtures hope by going to a couple competition on Sunday
After three one-way sessions, Saturday's two-on-two game may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The rolling initiative is an exceptional fictional sports concept, but it is one that players believe in, and in such competitions it is particularly pronounced.
So who has the initiative?
"They had an advantage of six points, and now four, so I guess it's a small initiative for us," Jordan Sleep said leaving.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and twelve more on the line.
The Americans, according to Speet, feel "wind in sails", and they have reasons to keep their spirits up, not least because of the form of Spith and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each can boast three points out of four.
Sleeping was unstoppable from tee to green, as he set a personal example.
The winning shouts got louder as his round continued, kicking the deciding ball into the hole, closing the match when he and Thomas gave two by two.
His blow, which gave them victory in the game on the 15th hole, was met with a similar cry, one of those who spoke of his belief in a chance for the American team.
"It is necessary to gather with all your strength and focus only on your game," Spit commented.
That's all that's left for the players right now.
Pass 18 holes and become winners.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Sleep and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undeniably included in the story of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe knocked four out of four, and they seem to know no mistakes.
Mollywood was the only couple that didn't recruit the Boggs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the Boggs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and, again, Friday morning.
Such a series, and the way their energy seems to circulate between them and violent fans, reinforces the belief that on Sunday they will not be defeated, and when the sun escapes the horizon of the Le Golf National field, there will be no more famous player that consolidates Europe's potential victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It'd be great if both of them were on different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly killed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The Boggis and two double goddesses on the first nine holes dug a Spaniard and a Swedish hole from which they never got out.
So on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your pit.
It's so exciting to watch a game of four balls and four players due to the interaction between the couples, the advice they exchange, and who deliberately silence, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
So far, Europe has played better as a team, and has gone a long way forward on the last day, but this session of the fours has also shown that the US team has all the strength to fight in which some, especially in America, doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads with a score of 10-6.
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after completing the four-ball and four-ball Saturday matches with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against two wins over struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score in Le Golf National to four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to recover the trophy lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the erroneous American team in the morning four-ball games, winning 3-1.
The US had more resistance in the fours, winning two matches, but they were unable to close the account gap.
Jim Ferick's team needs eight points out of 12 Sunday matches to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they then greatly united to defeat the fallen spirit of Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechebmo with an even stronger 5/4.
Woods, who passed two Saturday matches, showed periodic glimmers, but now he has lost 19 out of 29 games to four balls and four to seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested before the four-ball game in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the four, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepk with a score of 2/1, ranked first and third in the world.
For Europe, however, the game did not become an easy and pleasant walk a refreshing day southwest of Paris.
Arriving three times by champion Jordan Sleep and Justin Thomas on Saturday, two points became a guideline for Americans.
They earned a strong 2/1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Polter in a four-ball game and returned later to beat Polter and Rory McIlroy with a 4/3 score in the fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did the team get out of the four-point gap, going out alone, given that Ferick's team, as hosts, had to play a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, the counterattack on Sunday looks like she's beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that “critically” will not be unilaterally disarmed without trust
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated at the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions increased mistrust of the United States and that his country would under no circumstances renounce its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Young-ho stated at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “substantial goodwill measures” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and the commitment not to build up nuclear weapons stockpiles or develop nuclear technologies.
"One symmetrical reaction from the United States, however, we are not seeing," he said.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to take unilateral action on disarmament first."
While Ri repeated the North Korean complaints already made about Washington's resistance to the "phased" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it had not rejected unilateral denuclearization without control, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ree referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Eun and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the incumbent US President and North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to start a movement towards "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised North Korea security assurances.
North Korea seeks to formally end the Korean War of 1950–53, but the United States states that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resists calls to ease the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"U.S. insists that "the first thing to do is to be denuclearized," and raises the level of pressure through sanctions to enforce its purpose, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of war," says Ri.
“The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a utopian dream of people who don't know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions reinforce our mistrust."
Ree did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae In over the past five months and added, "If South Korea were the party to this issue of denuclearization, not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate."
However, Ri's tone differed sharply from last year's when he said in the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles on the United States mainland was inevitable after "Mr. President of evil" Trump called Kim a "suicide rocket".
This year at the UN, Trump, who threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said that much remained to be done, and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said it does not indicate any time frame for this process: "Will it take two years, three years, or five months — it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's introduction of sanctions must continue actively and necessarily until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to block the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the margins of the UN General Assembly summit and reported after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, but within hours of that visit North Korea condemned him for "band demands".
North Korea promised, at a meeting held with Moon this month, to dismantle the missile system, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States, for its part, took “relevant measures”.
According to him, Kim told him that the "relevant measures" he was talking about were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest in special courses
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, helped all elementary students learn to sleep more and combat the chauvinist culture of continuous caffeine consumption in order to stay awake "night-to-night".
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believed was the first of its kind in the United States.
After his discovery, he was caught up in the idea of introducing such a course, giving a preliminary report on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
"At the end of my report, a girl came up to me and said, 'It's a shame I didn't find out about it until now, when I was almost completing my studies.'
She said that no one had ever told her the importance of sleeping — which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered to students this year, tells how a healthy sleep habit contributes to academic and sports performance, as well as how it improves the overall well-being of the individual.
Paul Barreira, a Harvard Medical School psychiatry professor and executive director of the University's Health Service, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it was revealed that students were severely sleepy during the school week.
The class lasts one hour and students perform a number of interactive assignments.
One section of the class offers an image of a room in a dormitory, where students, by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, simulators and books, learn how each of these actions and substances — coffee, the light that causes sleep deprivation — affects sports outcomes, and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
An interactive campus map encourages participants to reflect on their daily lives.
"We understand that these classes will not change students' behavior at once.
But we believe they have a right to know, like any other person has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health," added Professor Chaisler.
According to him, a false sense of pride for being able to "plow all night" is still quite common, and modern technologies, just as increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
He said that enough sleep of good quality was a student's “secret weapon” to deal with stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to deal with overweight, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of starvation, making it constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiaman studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop the course by attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar training programme before entering a competitive educational institution.
Professor Chaisler recommends that students install an alarm clock warning them to go to bed and wake up, and to remember the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, which disrupts the human biotic and leads to problems with falling asleep.
Livingstone 1–0 Rangers: Menga's goal brings victory over Gerrard's team
The Rangers survived another sad retreat as Dolly Meng's goal led Stephen Gerrard's unelected team to a 1–0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox team hoped to obtain their first away win after a 4:1 win in February in St Johnston, but the Gary Holt team only defeated Görrard second out of 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving an easy win to the Harts team, the leaders of the Scottish Premier League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers lineup, which had lost spirit, did not seem to be going to level the score.
While the Rangers now dropped to sixth place, the Livingstone rose to third place, and gave only to the Hibernian according to the scored goals.
And the Rangers may have additional problems after linear judge Kalum Spence had to heal the head wound after some object was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight replacements for the team that went through the Er in the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
In turn, Holt went with Livy 11's same strategy, which increased the gap with the Harts last week, and he would be glad to see his well-reduced composition narrow the opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have been leading in the possession of the sword, but the Livingstones were squeezing far more when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to score a goal in just two minutes when Meng's first broadcast to Scott Pittman stopped Allan McGregor, but the quarterback took the chance.
Keegan Jacobs carried out a penalty strike against team captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgow, was only able to send the ball towards the farst bar.
The Rangers intercepted control, but in the last third there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he had to strike a penalty in the forty-fifth minute when he and Stephen Lawless collided, but Judge Stephen Thomson disagreed with the Colombian's statement.
The Rangers made only two punches in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about Lassan Coulibaly's head, and the weak strike by Ovi Ejaria.
Although Livy's first goal, scored in the 34th minute, may not have matched the game, no one can deny that they earned it exclusively by their own work.
But again, the Rangers failed to handle Jacobs' game from a standard position.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to pass the ball to Meng for completion.
Gerrard began acting on the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately came to fruition when the extreme quarterback gave the pass to Morelos, but impressive Kelly raced off his line to intercept.
But Livingstone continued to drag guests into their intended game with Litgow and Halkett, constantly making long broadcasts.
Holt's team tried to increase the breakout in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before Litgow gave the gear from the corner of the field.
The Rangers backup player, Glenn Middleton, once again demanded a penalty strike after he faced Jacobs, but Thomson again refused.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger meter
And now our almanah's Sunday morning page: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago this day, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
As one of the foundations of science, Geiger's enumerator became also one of the pillars of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s film Colokola Coronado, with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — so seemingly unlike scientists — starring:
Man: "What the hell is this thing?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear the influence of atoms caused by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Here, I can hear you right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, not having lived a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named after its author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" abnormal cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" abnormally growing cells and kill them.
Part of the vaccine's therapeutic action is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions.
As a result of this change, cells are given the ability to "see" the type of protein that characterizes many cancers, then the cells must be re-induced
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One patient who was introduced with the vaccine, and whose immune system has learned to recognize abnormal cells, has had ovarian cancer in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can "see" the HER2 protein characteristic of many types of cancer, then the modified cells are re-injected to the patient.
Professor J. Berzofsky, U.S. National Cancer Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, claims, "The results we have are hinting we have a very promising vaccine"
Professor Berzofsky explains: HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar method was successfully used in treating leukemia, which consisted in extracting immune cells from patients and their "education" as to how cancer cells should be affected.
Kanye West defended Trump in the MAGA cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was a whistler in the studio during a Saturday concert at which he spoke in defense of US President Donald Trump, claiming that he would re-enter the position in 2020.
After performing his third song, "City Ghost", which he performed, he put on the cap "Make America Great Again", the performer gave a speech against Democrats and supported Trump.
"I talk to white people very often, and they ask me, "How can you support Trump, he's a racist?".
Well, if I cared about questions of racism, I would have left America long ago," the performer said.
SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Damon in the lead, in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavano's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Christine Blacey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
TV did not show how the crowd was outraged by West's remarks, but this video was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is now unclear whether Rock tried to mock West in this step.
In addition, West complained to the public that his hat had been mocked backstage.
"They were messing with me behind the stage.
They say don't come out in that hat.
They were really messing with me!
Washington Examiner quotes his words, "And they also said that my position is not cool."
West continues, "Do you want to know what's not cool? Put on a Superman coat so no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue to develop?
Then you need love."
His comments at least twice caught the audience's attention, members of the SNL cast seemed confused, and one person said to the publication, "The entire studio has plunged into silence."
West was invited at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariane Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the song "I Love it" in a Perry bottle suit.
West received the support of the head of the Conservative group TPUSA Candice Turner, who tweeted, "One of the bravest people: SASYBO FOR SUPPORT OF MANY".
The host talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "who he is, and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I do not want to support anyone (buying his music, clothes or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my view, shares and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Duddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dog, originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and another example, of course, is the artist who has recently become a legend, the Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist formerly known as the Prince (Prince).
Attempted murder for stabbing at Belfast Restaurant.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of stab wounds on Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident occurred in Ballikhamor, as reported to the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
Game of Throne Star Keith Harington attacks toxic masking
Keith Harington is known for his role of waving the sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series HBO "Game of Thrones".
However, recently, a 31-year-old actor hotly criticized the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such characters often inspire young people to think that to be respected, you must necessarily be cruel.
In his interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Throne colleague, Rose Leslie, his age, admitted that he was "very partial" to the problem.
"Personally, I take this question quite seriously: Where are we wrong about perception of masculinity?" the actor asks.
"What do we teach growing up kids that we have this problem today?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for this surge in toxic masculinity due to too muscular characters.
The actor continues, "What is inborn and what is acquired?
What do they teach on television and on the streets that makes young men feel that they have to show only one particular side of masculinity?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is, how can we change that?
Because today with young people, something really is wrong.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequells or sequels of the Game of Thrones, after the series ended next summer, stating that he had "completed battles and horses".
Since November, Keith will play a leading role in Sam Shepherd's re-starring "The Holy West", which tells of film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believes meeting Rose's wife is the best Game of Thrones finale for him.
"I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my future life," says the actor.
Rose played The Player, an object of passion for character Keith John Snow in a Fenthesia series awarded to Emmy awards.
The couple celebrated the wedding in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens who have contracted HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering from these diseases.
About 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, indicating a change in the trends of the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infections by this means has been reduced to near zero, as stated by Chinese health-care officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Studies confirm that 70 to 90 per cent of men who have sex with men eventually marry women because of the country ' s conservative values.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection for these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters disproves information about a leak from Republican senators, complaining of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
U.S. MP Maxine Waters rejected the charges on Saturday that one of its employees posted personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the lawsuits were forged by "ultraver" experts and websites.
"L lie, lie, and even worse lies," Waters states on his Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. senators.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during hearings before the Senate Commission on Allegations of Sexual Harassment Against a Candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after three senators interviewed Cavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was linked to Waters' office, and disclosed information about Waters staff, Hill reports.
"This unfounded allegation is absolutely false," Waters assures me.
“A member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent acts, was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded allegation is a complete lie."
Waters' statement immediately sparked criticism on the Internet, including from former White House spokesperson Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleisher writes.
"This means that the author has a temperament not suitable for working in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why get angry?
You don't have to make excuses, either.
And you don't have to look into the prosecution's motives either.
We must remain calm and cold."
Fleisher seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrat criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters' seat in the midterm election, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very important," he writes.
In her statement, Waters writes that her office warned "the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent acts.
"We will make sure that the criminals are found," she writes, "and that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which can be devastating and dangerous to all and every one of my employees."
Johnny English strikes again - a weak parody of a spy, Rowan Atkinson
Today, it has become a tradition to seek Brexit's meanings in any new film that somehow features Britain; this also applies to the new parody spy franchise Agent Johnny English, which began production as early as 2003 and continued in 2011 with Agent Johnny English: Rebooting.
Will a self-pairing picture with a leitmotive "obviously that we're all shit" become a new attempt at national exports?
At any rate, the puddle-eyed profan Johnny English with a rubber face gained his right to chaos for the second time — his name is the brightest hint that he is a wide-screen comic creation intended for a non-English film audience.
The hero, of course, is a dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims about glamorous smoothies, received a little Clouseau, Mr. Bean's traits, and a portion of this guy who contributed one single note to the Charios of Fire tune in London at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the mysterious "international" Atkinson, who once played in the forgotten television commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero leaves behind complete chaos.
This last issue of JE has one or two pleasant moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the blades were lashing on his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates Atkinson's gift to physically perform comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and oddly superfluous, especially because "serious" film experiments such as Agent 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an element confidently.
It seems like humor is for children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's bizarre evils are not as ingenious and appropriate as Atkinson's pranks in Mr. Bean movies.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker infiltrated a top-secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of duty agent Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately got an occasional role.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, a pompous and assertive figure already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does everything possible for the character Quasi-Treza-May, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to pull someone out of retirement.
And here, the clumsy Johnny English himself is on the stage, who now works as a schoolteacher at some pontual institution, but also gives unofficial lessons in secret operations: there are some good jokes here, as English offers the "rock" skills of the spy academy.
English returns to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunites with his former inactive buddy Buff, who is again played this time by Ben Miller.
Buff now a married man reporting to the submarine commander is the role of the "fun hockey clubs" in which Vicki Pepperdin is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game because Her Majesty's secret service has made terrible mistakes, and they face a beautiful fatal woman, Ofelia Bulletova, in the performance of Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is exposed in dangerous ways to the charms of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems, the sinister Jason Volta played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their odyssey of farce jokes: disguised as waiters, they set the French restaurant on fire; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on Volt's luxury yacht; English breeds complete anarchy by trying to use the virtual reality garrison to familiarize themselves with the interior of the Volt's house.
All of these scenes are, of course, a nice and catchy fantasy, but there's something very childish about them.
It's quite moderate.
And, as with other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that is truly commensurate with his talent?
Labour denies that they are working out a plan to reduce British workweek to four days in five days' pay.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week, but will receive payment in five days.
The party reportedly wants company managers to give employees the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra day off.
This would allow staff members to enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea was "put" on the party's economic agenda and would help the people of the country take the side of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved a four-day work week to enable workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking Labour Party source said The Sunday Times: It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is our goal, which is consistent with the party's approach to changing balance sheets in the economy in favour of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week back during its 2017 campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently disapproved by the majority of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said, "The four-day working week is not party policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell used a Labour conference last week to concretize his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. MacDonnell said he was determined to break power from “faceless directors” and “speculants” of utility firms.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current water channel shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour government may make "cut-off" on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in company boards and to establish Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of private sector firms' capital to workers who would be able to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether an FBI investigation into Cavanaugh can change their opinion
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment as a supreme judge for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency's findings would encourage any Republican senators to support Cavanaugh.
In an interview shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelly interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, whether the FBI could find anything to make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy replied.
"When I went to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and I came up with this information, and I said, "Did you do it?"
His answer was strong, definite and unambiguous."
But Graham's opinion on the vote remained unshakeable.
"I have made a firm decision about Brett Cavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, on the strength of action comparable to dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing for sure: Brett firmly denied all this," added Graham, addressing Christine Blacey Ford.
“No one she called as witnesses could confirm these facts either.
It's been 36 years.
And I didn't notice anything new about it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, an annual music event in which an impressive stellar force is taking part with an equally impressive mission — the end of poverty worldwide.
For the seventh year of the World Citizens' Festival, tens of thousands of people flock to the great lawn of the Central Park, but not only to enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to talk about the real goal of the exercise: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 World Citizens Festival is a follow-up to the global project on combating poverty carried out by an international group of human rights defenders, which hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to volunteer or send an e-mail to the world leader, make a telephone call or perform any other or other meaningful action to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the World Citizens' Festival been in 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people freely attending a concert really convincing fellow citizens to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "citationism" where people believe that they are making real changes by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Global Citizen organizers claim that since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been registered at the festival by its supporters, who pursue many different goals.
It is mentioned that as a result of these actions, world leaders pledged more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group voiced 390 commitments and announcements that were made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided directly to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most significant commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children to realize their full potential", promised to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the district, which was done after more than 4,700 tweets were received from Global Citizen participants.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice about malnutrition in the past history," said Ambassador Power of Nutration Tracy Ulman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to encourage Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government had announced funding for the “Food Power” project, which would reach 5 million women and children through activities to improve nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen organisers respond, "It will be a long and difficult path on which we will occasionally stumble and fall.
But as in the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeanel Moné are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York City, and its hosts will be Deborra-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy to "block" to prevent Russian energy exports: the Home Secretary
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke stated that Washington could "if necessary" resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's presence in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he says.
And according to the official, there are certain ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of sea lanes and, if necessary, a blockade to prevent their energy from entering the market”, says the minister.
Zinke addressed participants in an event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that position itself as a "voice of energy consumer" in the United States.
He goes on to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and substitution of fuel," says the minister, calling Russia a "spony with one trick", whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements were made that the Trump administration had set the goal of increasing its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe by replacing Russia, which offered a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" North Flow 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a "punisher" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Northern Flow 2 project, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce resistance to the project is based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists, represented by the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"When a third state interferes in our energy supply, this poses a serious problem," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) after the recent meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will carefully explore the possibility of running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that she would carefully explore the possibilities of running for president after the midterm election.
At a meeting of city dummies in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the election race.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that to happen, a woman is needed "upstairs," Warren The Hill says.
"After 6 November, I will carefully consider the possibility of running for president".
Warren assessed the performance of President Donald Trump during the meeting: "It leads this district in the wrong direction."
"I am to the bone concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is an open critic of both Trump and his candidate for the post of supreme judge, Brett Cavanaugh.
On her Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, we need to investigate the FBI before we start voting."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of the voters themselves, Warren, did not think that she should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the University Center for Political Studies of Saffolk/Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters stated that the senator should not run.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the other hand, supported its plans.
The poll showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Delaul Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the election, and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known Democratic names that were discussed in connection with the 2020 perspective include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden claims he will make a formal decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke about Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at a meeting with the voters of Donald Trump.
Trek Palin, 26, who joined the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"My son, who has returned home, is now experiencing the same experiences as other family members who suffer from PTSD and who have suffered injuries, and our soldiers return with injuries," she said in a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "blind in the eye" and said of her son and other war veterans: "They return already to others, stoned, wondering if there is the same respect for their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military they have given their country."
Trak Palin was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with the situation of violence and possession of weapons in a state of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support the challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and D.C. support legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prohibits the granting of asylum to victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts filed an analytical note on Friday in Washington, D.C., by a court consultant on support for an asylum-seeker contesting policy.
The plaintiff's full name in the "Grace v Sessions" suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal politics is not disclosed.
A woman claims that her civilian husband "and his sons, who are members of a criminal group", ill-treated her, but on 20 July U.S. officials rejected her asylum application.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala submit a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as countries facing widespread problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney-General of Columbia, Carl Racine, stated in his Friday statement that the new policy "is ignoring decades of application of State, federal and international law".
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle,” says the report of the court consultant.
Lawyers also argue that policies that prohibit immigrants from entering harm the US economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens who are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sashns ordered immigration judges no longer to provide shelter to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
"Shelter will be given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sashns said in his statement of 11 June.
This instrument was never intended to address all the problems, even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save lives in the Pala: the number of deaths doubles in search of survivors
For survivors, the situation became more and more difficult.
"It's very difficult now," says Ris Kusum's 35-year-old mother, comforting her sick baby in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings wounded.
Clean water in large deficit".
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig into wet things, and try to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overburdened.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, rested near the army's Palu Hospital, where patients were treated in the open because they were forced to leave the premises due to continuing strong shocks.
He cries, remembering how a severe earthquake destroyed a hotel room on the fifth floor, which he filmed with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I think I've been squeezed into the wreckage of the wall, ” says Haris Associated Press, explaining that his family came to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they're saved and they're fine now."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "attacks" through "promotional advertising"
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a four-page commercial in the daily American edition, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to a paid supplement to Des Moines Register China Daily, Iowa's largest commercial newspaper publication, accusing China of attempting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congress election, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the US election is a confirmation of the fact that US officials have told Reuters: a new stage is emerging in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now in a state of escalation in the trade war, as a result of which they equalize tariffs on their countries' imports.
China’s back tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Trump Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter to China, claims that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in the Sunday magazine Des Moines Register, "now doubles this harassment by posting propaganda in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of our heart's American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying and posting ads in Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"However, in newspaper kiosks here on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices and see a true variety of opinions that the Chinese could learn about China's alarming economic policies, since local media are under the strict control of the Communist Party of China," he writes.
He also added that one of China's best-known newspapers had been "closely dissected" from the proposal to publish his article, although he did not give the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: Cavanaugh's delivery of Republicans repulses women voters prior to the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stand aside and defend the candidacy of Supreme Judge Brett Cavanaugh despite several allegations of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially from women, that may affect the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around this situation have been heated to the extreme, and most Republicans have officially stated that they want to continue voting.
You can't go back to such things later, ” writes Grant Rier, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that attempts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation, made at the very last minute, will be sufficient to calm angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the MoveOn progressive group Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November ahead!" opposite the Senate, when Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to nominate Cavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blacey Ford's testimony, Mic reports.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond," stated non-partisan political scientist Stu Rothenberg on the news site.
"People say the situation's already heated up enough, and it's true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of female voters in the suburbs and young voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for the post of supreme judge, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirmed the nomination, this move could trigger a reaction.
"This is already a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former chairman of the Republican National Committee early last week, as NBC News reports.
"The talk goes not only on the committee vote or final vote, or whether Cavanaugh sat on the dock, but also on how Republicans deal with it, how they treat it," says Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, a news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided on the question of who to believe, Ford or Cavanaugh, and tend to lean a little more towards the latter side.
A new YouTube poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony accurately or most likely, while 35 percent said they believe Cavanaugh accurately or most likely.
In addition, 38 percent believe that Cavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At the insistence of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Law Committee that Cavanaugh, while intoxicated, attacked her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the post of supreme judge showed her his genitals at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest technological legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to give access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt was to gain "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he says about his startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data repositories" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, file lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional data tools.
The application operates on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify -- everything can be used in the same browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of a personal online data warehouse is that it is fully managed by the user, who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle "personal empowerment through data".
According to John Bruce's CEO, Inrupt's idea is that the company has provided resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several regular developers contracted to work on the project, and a volunteer programmer community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not negotiating with Facebook and Google on whether his companies should make fundamental changes that would completely change all their business models overnight.
"We don't ask their permissions".
In his post on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee's voice has been quite influential in the debate about neutrality on the network.
Even starting Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet," Berners-Lee says.
Bernard Vann: Church minister awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one warrior priest was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglies and Leukour.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
A memorial to this event was inaugurated by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "very symbolic" that the monument was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette of 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann conducted his battalion through the St. Canten Canal "in a very thick fog and under heavy fire of field guns and machine guns".
He later threw himself into the line of fire and led the group forward with the "greatest courage" and then threw a field gun with one hand, shooting down three unit soldiers.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old grandson of the hero Michael Vann said that "he could hardly do the same heroicly, but it humbles."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put a wreath at the end of the parade, which was run by the Imperial Youth Orchestra Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that "it is a great honour for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the valor of the true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they were shown pig Peppa.
Imagine you didn't sleep all night to watch a full Bellator 206, but you weren't allowed to see the main event.
San José's table contained 13 battles, including six battles of the main program, the fights were broadcast live all night on 5 UK television.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, the fans of the United Kingdom were stunned to see Pig Peppa on screens.
Some fans weren't impressed because they didn't sleep till morning just to watch the fights.
One of the fans on Twitter called this change in broadcasting for a children's cartoon "some sick joke."
"There was a state ruling that for 6:00 a.m., this content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Bellator for Marketing and Communications when asked why it happened.
"Yes, Pig Peppa".
Bellator president Scott Coker said that they were planning to schedule so that future battles could also be watched by viewers from the UK.
"As for the rerun, I think we can solve this issue," Coker says.
"But there's Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we can't solve this until Sunday in our time, and for them it'll be Monday.
But we'll do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, there were a lot of text messages, all of which were far from friendly.
We tried to solve this problem right away, thought it was some kind of technical breakdown.
Turns out, no, it was a matter of national importance.
I promise you, this is not gonna happen next time.
We'll reduce the number of battles to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans, we try to increase that number, but we're overdoing it.
Yeah, it didn't work out well."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferiority due to his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what gave him the motivation to be successful.
A 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize that "not everyone like him" until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program led by Lauren Lavern, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hopeful".
He also said that winning at the Olympics became less of an issue for him after he had a child.
The regular host of Kirsty Young's multi-year show took a few months' leave due to illness.
Daley, who served as the main guest in Lavern's program, said he felt "more insignificant than any of his peers" because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He says, "To date, these feelings of worthlessness and inappropriateness have been quite real, but they have given me strength, and I have succeeded."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" to not disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexual orientation.
A two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a well-known LGBT activist and at his address at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he was able to live an open life, without consequences, and wanted to give others "hope".
A three-time world champion said that feelings for a man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "took him by surprise."
Last year, Daley married Oscar's winner, who was 20 years older than him, but claims that the age difference was never a problem.
"If there's so much going on in your life at such a young age," he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, "it's hard to find a peer who would have the same fundamentally opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, having a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said that "all his worldviews" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win a gold medal," says the athlete.
"But you know what, there are things more important than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father didn't want to put up with his dying, and one of his last requests was front-row tickets to the London 2012 competition.
"I couldn't tell him "Dad, you won't be around then, and you won't be able to sit there in the front row," Daley says.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing, I finally realized he wasn't invincible," says the athlete.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming about all my life -- diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song, Proud by Heather Small, which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes him so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 p.m. English summertime.
Mickelson, out of uniform, spent this Saturday's Ryder Cup on the bench.
The American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to pull the form to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Mickelson, who played the Biennale for the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Furick on the bench on Saturday for four balls and four quarters.
Instead of being at the center of events, as has often been the case in the United States, a five-time major winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in the hope of correcting his concerns.
Never having the most direct blow, even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old athlete is not the ideal candidate for the hard road Le Golf National, where a long raf usually punishes for inaccurate punches.
And if the course itself is not sufficiently frightening, Mickelson in the ninth match on Sunday will meet with the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in the 12 and single matches make a bright start, Michelson's match may prove decisive.
Ferrick expressed confidence in his partner, though he could have said something else.
"He fully understood the role assigned to him today, patted me on the back, hugged and said he would be ready tomorrow," Ferick commented.
"He's pretty confident and in himself.
He's a walking Hall of Fame, and he's done so much for these teams both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there, with everyone."
On Sunday, Michelson will break Nick Foldeau's record for the number of matches in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven drawbacks, although Ferick said his presence had been of great benefit to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to train people, and he's a great guy who's interesting," he explained.
"I think young players had fun with him this week, and it was interesting to see that.
His game is much more than just a game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows in his experience that significant single-class leadership in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unfavourable side.
Dutchan made his debut in a match in 1997 in Walderram, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had an advantage of five points over the Americans, but crossed the finish line only slightly ahead with the least difference, winning with a score of 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"You continue to remind yourself that we had a great advantage in Walderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram, where we won, but only so far," said Bjorn, captured in a photograph, after watching the 2018 Class, winning on the Le Golf National field with a score of 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, which resulted in a score of 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over.
Tomorrow, you'll be full.
Go and do the right thing.
As long as you don't have your glasses on the tablet, it's not over.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I spoke loudly, focusing on our team's 12 players, but we already know what we're up against, against the world's greatest players."
Satisfied by the way his players performed on their uncomfortable golf course, Bjorn added, "I would never have surpassed myself in this.
Tomorrow we're going to have another trial.
We're starting our individual performances tomorrow, and that's a whole different story.
It's always nice to be with a partner when things are going well, but when you're left there alone, you're experiencing all your skills as a professional golfer.
That is the idea that players need to be encouraged to come to the full tomorrow.
Now the partner remains behind, and he must also make every effort."
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferick, believes that his individual players will perform better than their partners, with the exception of Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Ferick himself went through all this carousel of the last days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finally losing when Europe hosted the Miracle in Medina.
"I remember every damn word about it," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had united his players before the last day.
"We've got 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to end it quickly, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves one way, it exerts great pressure on the matches in the middle.
We accordingly built our plan for the game and tuned the guys the way we thought was right, you know? Tomorrow we'll try to make a miracle."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting Rory McIlroy in the top match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ayyan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
"I have chosen this group of guys, and in this order, because I think they will thus close all possible flaws," Bjorn said, commenting on their choice of individual players.
The commissioning of the new German warship was again delayed
The newest frigate of the German fleet was to be put into service in 2014 to replace the ageing Cold War warships, but this will not happen at least next year due to defective systems and avalanche cost increases, local media reports.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the main ship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit, citing a military representative.
The ship was to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, they will have a powerful gun, many anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some steel technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from domestic ports.
Nevertheless, the constant postponement of commissioning means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, will be obsolete by the time they become armed, notes Die Zeit.
An evil F125 frigate hit news headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet had returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media referred to a number of critical "programming and hardware defects" that made a warship useless when used in combat.
The limitations of software were particularly critical, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it has been found that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its productivity and limits the ability of the Navy to introduce future renewals.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is twice as heavy as ships of the same class that were used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared with the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of anchoring the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings to reduce Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defense committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the naval forces were effectively "ending their supply of ships capable of deployment".
The official said that the problem had increased over time because old ships had been decommissioned, but they had not been provided with replacement ships.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could ever be taken over by the fleet.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study conducted in one of the Scotland Highlands is designed to show how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is hoped that the data obtained will provide a new perspective on the behaviour of unique winged mammals and will assist in the continued conservation of the species.
A study organized by National Foundation scientists in Scotland will examine common non-tops, non-topsoprano, and brown long hair bats and Dobanton nightstands inhabiting Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at some points around the site to monitor bat action throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile site surveys using manual detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screams as well as the activities for which the different groups of these animals are responsible.
A habitat map will then be drawn up and a report prepared to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on the scale of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, the NTS conservation advisor, hopes that these results will show which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of habitat management, such as grassland formation, as well as ways to maintain forest areas optimal for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened with extinction due to construction and development work that affects their habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can be dangerous, as well as adhesive tape for flies, chemical processing of building materials, and hunting of pet cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to accurately identify the obstacles to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of bat populations very seriously.
The organization has 10 trained experts who conduct regular interviews, on-site checks and sometimes rescue.
The organization even created the first and only bat reservation in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of Scottish bats live.
Real estate manager David Thompson says the property is the perfect territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, a great place for bats," he says.
"Here are old buildings, many old trees and all elements of good habitat.
But much about bats remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need for a prosperous existence."
It recalls the importance of testing for bats prior to maintenance within private domain, as the inadvertent destruction of one nest can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young people, and possibly even to the destruction of the entire local population.
The bats are protected by law, their destruction, harassment or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish bat conservation fund officer, appeals to the public for help.
She says, "We have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how many of their individual species live."
Ronaldo denies the rape charges, and his lawyers are going to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo denies the rape charges against him, calling them "fake news", and argues that people simply "want to propiarize" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Spiegel, which published charges against a footballer.
Forward Portugal and Juventus were charged with raping an American woman named Catherine Majorg who allegedly occurred in Las Vegas' hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, reporting to Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a video in Instagram in which a footballer has 142 million subscribers, a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo called this information "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all fake news,” claims the five-time winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They just want to propyarize using my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's just part of their job.
I am a happy man, and everything is fine," adds an athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue "Spiegel" for charges they called "unacceptable information on suspicions of confidentiality," according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Shertz stated that the player intended to claim compensation for "moral damage in an amount commensurate with the gravity of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorg allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged incident Ronaldu fell to her knees and told her that he was "99 percent a good guy but failed one percent".
The documents say Ronaldu confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it was consensual.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "fear that she would be avenged" and feared "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman said that she was trying to change her place of residence, as she continued to experience traumatic feelings resulting from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved on to Italian giants Yuve in a 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: Britain "will regret car manufacturers lost forever"
The Secretary of Business and Enterprise, Greg Clark, stated that Britain "will regret it forever" if Brexit loses its status as the world's car-making leader after Brexit.
He also commented on information that Toyota UK had informed the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker stated that the consequences of border delays in the absence of a Brexit deal could result in job losses.
The Bernaston plant produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped," says Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will close the Mini production plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to auto manufacturers, if there is no transaction within the Brexit supply chain, there will be a high risk.
Toyota's production line is run on time, and parts for custom-made cars are supplied by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be disruptions at the border that industry representatives say may lead to delays and shortages of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store stocks at its Derbyshire plant for more than one day, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa May's plan, voiced in the Checkers, about future relations with the EU "exactly calibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need a deal. We want to make the best agreement that will allow, again, not only success now, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future," he told BBC Radio 4 on air today.
"Not only Toyota, but also other producers claim that we should be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains".
Toyota was unable to specify how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Zuvallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the factory's union, says the concern of the organization's members is growing: "In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we can't get them back."
A government spokesman says, "We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to White House information.
Donald Trump's responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "rescheduled for another week," as the fight for the candidacy of Brett Cavanaugh for the post of supreme judge continues, the White House stated on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Müller, who investigates Russia's interference in the elections, links between Trump's aides and Russia, and potential obstacles to justice by the President.
Whether Trump would dismiss the Deputy Attorney General from office, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, there has been a lot of speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of the president impeachment through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein disproves this information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York City, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judicial Committee, at which Cavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blacey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the FBI's complaints against Cavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's spokesperson, Sarah Sanders, spoke at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied, "The date of this meeting has not yet been set, it is possible that this week, and it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all other events taking place in the Supreme Court."
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed."
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not given briefings at the White House since September 10.
Leading Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says that the lack of briefings is not due to the "scorn for the community" of television reporters, although she added, "I will not deny that they play in public."
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
"President holds more meetings to answer journalists' questions than any other president before him," she added without, however, giving exact figures: "We have these numbers."
Sanders assured that briefings would continue to take place, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it's much better than talking to me."
We try to do it as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had in the past few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it's a worthy substitute for press briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, participating in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
Conferences exclusively for the press are rare at all.
The president's unwitting and sometimes strange behavior in front of journalists gathered this week in New York is perhaps the answer to why.
Health Minister writes to EU workers in Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health addressed the EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express gratitude on behalf of the entire country and to wish them to remain in their posts after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, MSP, wrote this letter to staff less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already made a commitment to cover the cost of issuing status applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between Britain and the EU on the withdrawal continued, and the expected decision is to be delivered this fall.
However, the British government is also strengthening preparations for a possible no-trade scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
It is therefore now that I want to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie suffered an emergency surgery for head injury.
Michael Organ of Tennessee reported that Tennessee States Tigers midfielder Christian Abercromby suffered an emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury on Saturday after defeating 31–27 in a match with Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury had been sustained shortly before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercromby oxygen on the sideline before putting it on a stretcher and taking it to a medical examination.
Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercromby had had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "yet there are no details of the type/stage of injury," and Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
For Abercromby, who only entered second year, it was the first season of Tennessee State after moving out of Illinois.
On Saturday, before he was out of the game, he successfully intercepted five balls, which totalled 18 balls in the season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher crest fee when buying real estate in the UK.
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty in buying real estate in the UK, and the additional money received will be used to help the homeless.
This move will undo Corbin's attempts to attract young voters.
Increased coat of arms will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year in favor of the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamping fee when buying real estate in the UK, and the extra money generated will be used to help the homeless — this will be announced today by Teresa May.
This move will negate Corbin's attempts to attract young voters who promise to make housing more affordable and to increase citizens' incomes.
An increase in the stamp fee would be charged to individuals and non-tax firms in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds thus generated should stimulate the Government ' s efforts to assist homeless citizens.
The increase to the existing coat of arms collection, including the increase introduced two years ago for secondary and rental housing, could be up to 3 per cent.
Treasury expects this move to deliver up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new properties in London are purchased by non-British residents, which increases prices and complicates the task of buyers acquiring their first homes to improve their housing conditions later.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities due to the large number of foreign buyers who, having purchased housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the coat of arms to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of vilifying real estate prices by buying land but not actually using it, and called on Ms. May to waive the quotas on affordable housing to correct the "disgraceful housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include the control of rents and the cessation of unjustified evictions.
He also wants to give local governments more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May said, "Last year I said that I had dedicated my premiership to fulfilling a British dream — to making life a better place with every new generation.
And that also means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
Nevertheless, it is unfair that for non-British people, as well as for foreign companies, real estate acquisition is as accessible as for hardworking British.
For too many people, the dream of acquiring their own home has become too distant, and the threat to some to be on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run Scotland"
Sunderland club boss Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager at a certain stage.
A 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the rebirth of the northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the first league, separating from the first three points.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, and that's it," said Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland with my father as a child in Hampden, and it always attracted me back.
However, this will only be possible if I can become the club's successful manager."
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland managers were also Dicka Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyette and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic says he did not feel awe in such authoritative names in such major clubs, having previously abandoned the offers of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success for the moment will depend on whether I can get this club back to the Premier League.
In its structure and capabilities, this club certainly belongs to the Premier League," says the coach.
"It's not easy to get him out there, but I'll think I've done my job only if I can get the club back."
Ross has served as manager for only three years, becoming first assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spending 15 months at Hearts coaching headquarters.
He then helped Alloa rise from level three and took St Mirren from low positions to the championship winners the following season.
Ross claims that he feels more comfortable today than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real intersection," he recalls his responsible work at Alloa.
"I sincerely believed that management was more appropriate for me than a game.
That sounds weird, because I did everything well, made a good living in this position and made some progress.
But playing is more complicated.
There's a lot of things to do weekly.
I'm still under stress at work, but I feel good about being a manager.
I have always wanted to lead, and now, doing so, I feel most comfortable as a fish in the water throughout my adult life."
You can listen to a full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, on Scottish radio from 12:00 to 1:00 on English summer time.
According to the poll, 17:30 is the perfect time for a pint of beer.
The summer heat led to increased sales of British pubs, but reduced sales in restaurant networks.
According to statistics, pub and bar sales increased by 2.7 per cent in July and restaurant sales fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consulting company, which received these statistics, says, "The continued solar activity, as well as England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup, means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when pub sales increased by 2.8 per cent and restaurants, on the contrary, declined significantly."
The June drop in income in the restaurant trade by 1.8% also continued in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol showed much better results than in restaurants.
Pubs selling only food also suffered from the heat of the sun, though not as much as restaurants.
There's a feeling that people just want to pop outside just to get a drink.
Drink sales in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month and food by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, RSM's entertainment and hotel analyst, says, "These results have continued the trend we have seen since late April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain critical when it comes to sales in the non-domestic market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, especially since a 4.8 per cent decline in sales on an annual basis will be particularly painful due to continued price pressures.
A long hot summer turned out to be more than ever for food operators, and it is not yet a fact that August, bringing more moderate temperatures, will provide much-needed respite."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the folding of brands.
Monitoring of Cofer Peach Tracker's industry sales for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 networks with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is a recognized industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has secret accounts on social media that he hides from his parents.
According to the survey, one in five children — some only 11 years old — have secret accounts on social media that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "fake insta" pages
This news has heightened concerns about sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "core" account their parents know about.
However, one in five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake "insta" accounts, i.e. Instagram, a photography exchange site.
This news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students stated that they had a primary, "clean" account to which their parents had access, but also secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally gained access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, came across a teenager who called others to "rape him."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles on social media, with half of them admitting that one of them was generally secret.
HMC chapter Mike Buchanan say, "Many teenagers seek to create online spaces that are inaccessible to their parents and teachers, and this is an alarming fact."
Eileed Doyle will become the "voice of athletes" of Scottish athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eileed Doyle was elected to the board of directors of Scottish athletics as an observer member of the board of the director.
Doyle is Scotland's most-titled athlete in athletics, and President Ian Beatty claims that this is an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from the broad experience of an athlete at the international level over the past decade.
"Eylid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British, and world athletic community, and we are confident that her participation will bring great benefit to athletics in Scotland," Beattie claims.
Doyle says, "I want to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really make a good contribution and promote sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and now works as a private commentator on the BBC, after having suffered a stroke, lost the ability to walk.
He tweeted, "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I've lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I was going to recover, and if so, to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing skill exercises!
Thank you so much for your support!"
The milk blower ad, in which the feeding mothers were compared to the cows, shared the views of Internet users
The milk-sucking company caused controversy on the Internet, publishing an advertisement in which nursing mothers are compared to milk cows.
Released to the market, it is said, "the world's first silent milk blower to be worn on the breast", the consumer technology company Elvie published an advertising music video demonstrating the freedom that the new milk blower provides to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a full hay cowhouse under a music track that has these words: "Yes, I feed my own milk, but you won't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed, it's not humid, it's my breast."
And then the choir goes, "Squeezing, cutting, we feed our babies breast milk, cutting, cutting."
This commercial, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying that it sheds light on the milk industry's "bitters".
"A very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are taken away from them within days of birth," writes one user.
Elvie's milk blower is dressed directly under a special bra (Elvie/Mother)
And here's another comment: "It's understandable that it's equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Another user adds: "Advertising detached from reality".
Others, on the contrary, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was "just great."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was feeding the baby, I'd definitely buy one.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but that's how it feels.
A brilliant product," wrote one user.
And another comment: "A cool ad designed for mothers who breastfeed (often do it in their workplaces or toilets) and who do feel a little "cows."
This advertisement is not to praise or scold our dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all danced with these invisible milk pumps hidden under bras.
The concept of this promotional campaign is precisely based on the fact that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk blower is completely infeasible, has no wires or tubes, is freely placed in a feeding bra, and is invisible, giving women the opportunity to move, hold babies, and even go outside during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood development specialist of Mother's company, comments: "The Molokosser Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it fully deserves bold and provocative advertising.
By drawing a parallel between women and milk cows, we wanted to bring breast-feeding and all its problems to the center of attention, while demonstrating in a funny and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that a new breast-sucker provides.
This is not the first time that an Elvie milk blower hits news headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Martha of Jakubovsky, using this product as intended.
Hundreds of migrant children moved freely to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively constant, in part because the tight rhetoric and policies adopted by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children on bailiffs.
Usually, most sponsors themselves are the same undocumented immigrants and are afraid to jeopardize their stay in the country by taking the child under bail.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested bail for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had not been tried before.
“Some 80 per cent of the persons who are either sponsors or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreigners who have committed a crime.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," said Olbens.
According to the staff of the shelter, in an effort to speed up the process of processing children, officials had introduced new rules that required some of them to be brought to trial within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as had previously been the case.
In order to declare their legal status as an immigration judge, many of them are present by video link rather than in person.
Those who are considered ineligible will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and information that has appeared in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
Lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Thornillo, where indications that a child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that carrying children to tent camps without giving them time emotionally to prepare or to say goodbye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw troops immediately
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the country was already at war for the eighth year.
Mual, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and would be “considered accordingly”.
"They must leave immediately and unconditionally," he said to the meeting.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been expelled from their homes, "the war on terrorism is almost over."
He said that Damascus would continue to "take this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar Al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been created for their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “dissemination of irrational fears”, which had prompted refugees to remain outside the country.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens," he says.
"They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be assisted in rebuilding until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province of three million people.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear timelines” and expressed the hope that the fighting would target jihadists, including Al-Qaida-affiliated militants from the Nusra Front, who would be “destroyed”.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the Government and the opposition, will be convened shortly in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem set out the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, stating that the commission's work should be limited to “considering the articles of the current constitution”, and warned against interference.
Why Trump wins a second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-election if impeachment and scandal do not conclude his presidency prematurely, which is probably the hope of many liberal viewers.
And this will no doubt be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency in history!"
So far, there's no sign that the audience is tired.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled, to 1.05 million per CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million prime time viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed cable channel ratings, collecting 3.5 million viewers in the evenings during the main news screening.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's beyond our understanding," says Neil Bair, director of the ABC drama, The Appointed Survivor, about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol has been destroyed by the attack.
Nell Skovell, a long-published comedy writer and author, "Only funny: A few unpleasant truths about entering the club by Hollywood boys" offers another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi to Boston once before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver informed her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied, "Yes, because he's funny!" says Ms. Skovell.
In all this chaos, there's something valuable about fun.
Of course, unlike all the other content broadcast on television, storylines on Washington events can determine the future of Row v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of immigrant family reunification and the health of the world economy.
Shutdown is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, when you have watched for the sixth consecutive hour as a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of a "deep background" for his book, or about Paul Manafort's $15,000 jacket from the ostrich skin (dressed with pride," as he writes "Washington Post"), or the sharp description of Stormy Daniels, let's say, Mr. Trump's anatomy is already beyond normal awareness.
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes.
"Currently his job is to make us feel that the reality show is to feed you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the changing acting composition of Trump's show and the daily plot twists (dracking with N.F.L., praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleis this week, there were 27 degrees of heat on the north bank of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get off the screen, at least not exactly when they show Brett Cavanaugh appearing before the Senate Law Committee and deciding the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows, people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," says Mr. Flace.
"Then I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outsider money is being invested in the toughest interim election the White House is running.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th District receives cash flow due to the change of districts in Congress, in which two officials participate in the race for the same seat.
This suburb of Pittsburgh, whose geography was not so long ago changed, supports a Democrat, member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in the extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb opposes another active official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the Old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which substantially intersects with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that, as a result of election frauds, the old districts had been assigned to Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a heated discussion about financing campaigns between the main party's financial forces, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after winning with a small difference in the March-wide special election for Congress in the 18th District of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give Democrats a small advantage.
The US punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then retreated
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, prompting a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, who also owned him in Panama until his partners evicted the Trump management team.
Representatives of the State Department decided to withdraw the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," announced earlier this month the spokesman for the Department of Heather Nauert.
However, only El Salvador, which received some $140 million in American aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support, was considered a possibility of punishment.
The proposed penalties, which included reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for that Central American country, with its high rate of unemployment and murder.
Against the backdrop of regular internal meetings, North and Central America had postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which had been held to take stock of a similar meeting held last year, which had been perceived as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, high-level officials of the Administration had indicated that they wanted the preparations for the conference to move forward and had effectively stopped considering the question of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October and will be addressed by Vice-President Mike Pence as a sign that the administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
Three United States diplomatic representatives returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without bringing any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate, which had been shared by three United States officials, including two diplomats, who had agreed to discuss internal matters on condition of anonymity.
Their reports also confirm an outside analyst who is a member of the administration, but also spoke on terms of anonymity.
Study History
The next step could be a report by Special Adviser Robert Müller on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump ' s justice, which is now very well established in public records.
Mr. Müller is also reported to have initiated an investigation into the existence of the Trump campaign's conspiracy with Russia and its attacks during the past elections.
If Congress changes master, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in this body, just as he prepares to speak again to voters, and perhaps eventually to his fellow jurors.
But there is a lot of ifs; I don't mean that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to stage a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
We did not, however, and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of bloodshed.
The course of history unfolds at such points, and the unrelenting march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are going through some of these critical moments right now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Müller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to this newspaper, last year he proposed to make secret recordings of the president's activities and argued that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that the data from The Times are incorrect.
"How will we react if the FBI's recently requested investigation into Brett Cavanaugh is not complete or true, or if he is still confirmed as a supreme judge despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
Above all, will we vote in the medium term for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials with dignity, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to pass them with dignity, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew exiled in Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, whose officials once occupied a Polish house, in which I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she walked me out to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
With a family past like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic in the run-up to a clash with the Viennese Rapid Football Club.
The Rangers accept the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that defeating the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will allow them to take strong positions in Group G of the League of Europe.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from performing for the first time in the season until a 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
"It was a good moment for us because Villarreal is a good team," said a 31-year-old footballer.
"We entered the game, believing we could get something and left with a draw.
We may have been able to handle it after all, but in general, the draw was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success came in the second half, where we were better.
This Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be a hard game because they did a good job in their last game, but given the fans' support, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
The past year has definitely been a tough one, considering everything that has to do with my injuries, and the replacements at the club itself, but there's a good factor in this place right now.
The composition is finely picked, and the guys really enjoy it; the trainings went to "ura."
I hope we can move forward, leave behind last season and succeed."
Women lose sleep for fear of their retirement savings
Although the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"People want, they were cared for by a family member, but don't try to discuss the subject with them," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide for Life Insurance.
And that's where we start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for likely having to take care of you unless you express your wishes beforehand.
Discuss with your consultant and family, where and how you will receive health care, as this choice may be an important cost factor.
Consult with your financial consultant to help you develop a plan to pay these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care can be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life insurance monetary policy that will help to cover these costs or insure yourself with your own property, provided you have money.
Get your legal documents in order: Get rid of the legal battles.
Draw up a health-care proxy and appoint a health-care trustee who will supervise your medical care and ensure that the specialists comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend that consideration be given to the possibility of drawing up a financial power of attorney.
A trustee should be chosen to assist you in making financial decisions and to monitor the payment of your accounts in the event that you are incompetent.
Do not forget the details: imagine that your elderly parent needed emergency medical care and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you then provide information on what medication he's taking and what he's allergic to?
Write down all these details on the paper so you can prepare yourself properly in case.
Martin adds: "Not only the availability of finance, but also the choice of doctors, is important."
"What medication do you take?
Who's gonna take care of your dog?
Draw up and write down this plan."
In Ilfracombe, a man fired a multiple burst of air rifle
A man shot a few times with a pneumatic rifle, returning home from a walk.
The victim, in the chest, whose stomach and arm were hit by bullets, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 on English summer time, as "accidental".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are currently searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people died as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to increase.
Due to the breakdown of communications, rescuers are unable to obtain any information from Donggal, an area north of Pala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Pala as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggal, located on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a county extending along 300 km (180 miles) of coastline on the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, an administrative district smaller than the province, had 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the backbone of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important for the provincial economy, but mainly concentrated in Morali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, several tsunamis have caused destruction in Pala and Donggala over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also occurred in western Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcanic fire ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A sequence of severe earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-strong earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred in Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5 magnitude earthquake occurred on one of the Mentawai islands of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck Pidi Jaya County in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake of 2004 and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes struck the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in ruins.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-candidate president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a situation in which domestic violence took place, and for resisting arrest, according to a report published by the Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to a police report, when a friend of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in Mat-Su detention and will be released on $500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when he was asked if he was guilty, he declared his "single innocence".
Palin is facing three minor class A crimes, which means that he may be imprisoned for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B crime punishable by up to one day ' s imprisonment and a US$ 2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of the report of domestic violence, and possession of weapons in a state of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veterans' groups in 2016, after explaining her son's brutal behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of casualties will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, video recordings of the incident appear.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Attorney's Office wants to impose a rare death sentence on a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Syfullo Saipov, suspected of having carried out a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare federal crime that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, aged 30, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, shooting down pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipopov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to a notification of intent to obtain the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges may be subject to the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read out a 22-point conviction against Saipova, which included eight counts of murder with the aim of racketeering, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and car destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack was "fully planned and deliberate", Saipopov carried it out, as described, in a "disgusting, cruel and criminal manner".
"Sifullo Habibullahevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlia, Hernan Ferruc, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagneukko," says the notice of intent.
Five of the dead were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since the prosecutor in the South District of New York requested the death penalty for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, the accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last death penalty in a federal case in New York City was imposed in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenbergs were executed using an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the judicial documents of Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan showed no remorse after his attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to watch ISIL videos on his phone to carry out the attack.
He also asked for the ISIL flag to be displayed in his hospital ward, told the police.
He denies having been charged with all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders acting on Saipov's side, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that a decision to impose the death penalty, rather than a life sentence without release, will only exacerbate the pain of these events for all their participants," Patton said.
The Saipov defence had previously requested prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Member of Parliament for Tori says that Nigel PHARAGE should not be held responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at Tori conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army".
Former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel over" Euroskeptics, as a member of parliament, Teresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party member Peter Boone said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain would have already "come out" if Mr. Farage was Brexit's secretary.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is compounded by the fact that members of the Tori Party who oppose the EU withdrawal join in a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The Premier tries his best to maintain his compromise plan, voiced in Checkers in the midst of attacks by Brexit supporters, his opponents, and the EU.
The Allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and thus force Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between her package and "haos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihalla that he wanted to "play the Checkers".
He suggested that Mr. Faraj should be levelled and held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we'd be out by now," he said.
Deputy Wellingborough added, "I will continue to compete for Brexit, but we need to beat the Checkers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We have not fought in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their mind and wanted to stay is completely untrue”.
Brexit's supporter of Tori Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, giving journalists a comment like, "I say, Prime Minister, just listen to people."
"Checkers are unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also unpopular among members of our party and our activists who actually storm the streets and primarily elect us.
Please put the Checkers aside and start listening to what you're being told."
In her emphatic address to Ms. May, she added: "Prime Ministers remain at their jobs if they remain true to their promises."
Mr. Faraj said that if politicians were going to betray the 2016 referendum decision, they must be forced to “feel high”.
"It's now a question of trust between us, people, and our political class," he says.
"They try to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let you get away with it."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit's betrayal, to feel the heat.
"We mobilize the people's army of that country, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become independent, independent and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, Brexit's opponents went through with a demonstration on Birmingham, then holding a two-hour rally in downtown.
Several activists waved "Tori v Brexit" posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, Labour Party member Lord Adonis criticized conservatives for security concerns in their party's mobile app.
"And these people claim they can customize the IT systems and technologies of Canada Plus Plus, to work at borders, to trade freely without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's one complete farce.
A good Brexit does not exist in principle," he argues.
Warren plans to "research" the possibilities of participating in the presidential race
U.S. Member of Parliament Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election she will "restraintly explore the possibilities of running for president".
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Party member Jeff Dyle, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There's talk that she has a chance to take Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon in Holyoke, she held another meeting with voters; since Trump took office, it has already been her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a town hall meeting.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to go to Washington to " fix" our broken government, which requires that there be a woman upstairs."
As a result of Sims' murder (stuck), an LSU player was arrested
Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder (shooting) of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday had been arrested.
At 11:00 p.m., at a press conference, the Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department released a video recording of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who was able to make the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Waid Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head that resulted in his death," stated the police chief Murphy J. Paul to journalists on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend, and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being involved in the incident, carrying a gun and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge District Police Department.
A young man 1 m 82 cm tall grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Champion title after team tactics gave him victory over Sebastian Fettel
From the moment Walthery Bottas qualified on Saturday, beating Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes' command tactics would play a major role in the race.
Already with the pole position Bottas had a good start and practically hung on Hamilton as he defended his position at the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to go on a pit stop, leaving Hamilton crawling in the tail of the entire group – a choice that became decisive.
Mercedes left for pit stop one lap later, and then came out behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some wheel-to-wheel struggle, burst forward, causing Ferrari's driver to reluctantly leave the inner space free, risking being caught after a double motion to protect on the third corner.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started with the back row of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap.
He then led most of the race, holding on to his native tires, to quickly finish, moving Kimi Rykkonen to fourth place.
He eventually left for pit stop on lap 44, but failed to increase the pace on the remaining eight laps as Rykkonen ranked fourth.
The day was a difficult one, as Valtery did a fantastic job on the weekend and showed genuine generosity by sharing it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a few tricks in stock," Hamilton said.
Traitory Sign Language
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Finestein at a meeting with voters on Saturday for her allegation that she had not made public a letter from Christine Blacey Ford accusing Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the post of supreme judge, of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate Law Committee, saying that what is happening in the Senate showed that the participants in these events were "scoundrel, nasty, and lying people."
"The only possible reaction to all of this, and what has happened in the last few days in the Senate, is fine, is anger, anger, abomination, and lies," he said.
"You see all these leaks, and then they say, "No, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Finestein, have you "slept" information?
Do you remember her answer... did you "slell" the document information?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.
Okay, stop.
Are we "silly"?...No, we didn't "slipped," he added with the senator's intonation.
A letter was sent in July to Finestein detailing the charges against Ford against Cavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally disclosed, but Finestein denies that the leak occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, but I didn't leak her information," said Finestein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked."
However, the manner in which she denied the leak charges did not seem to like the president, who commented on it during Saturday's rally: "Here's what I'll tell you: the body language has really let her down.
She may not have "split," but the body language was the worst I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend his candidate for the post of supreme judge, whom three women accused of sexual harassment, the President suggested that Democrats were using these accusations for their own ends.
"They are definitely trying to regain power by all available means.
We see scorn, abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to step over to gain power and control," quotes Mediaite the president's words.
British Elite Hockey League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals, for the Giants in a game against Dundee
In the Elite Hockey League game, the Dundee Stars paid for Friday's defeat against the Belfast Giants, winning a return match on Saturday with a score of 5-3 in favour of the Dundee.
The Giants received an early two-goal advantage thanks to the punches of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised the level of the home team before Dwyer brought the Giants to lead.
François Bouchard compared the Dundee score before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
For Adam Keefe's men who won the Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday night, this was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
Between the parties, it was the fourth meeting in the season when the Giants won three previous matches.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after Kendall McFall's goal pass with David Rutherford's support, after which Boviller doubled the advantage four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the owners to the game at 13:10 p.m. before Matt Markwardt helped Cooney to level the score at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer made sure the Giants intercepted the initiative in the first break when he scored the second goal in the evening at the end of the first period.
The owners regrouped, and Bushar leveled the score again, scoring a goal with a numerical margin of 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee an opportunity to take the lead for the first time in a match at the end of the second period, after which he and his team secured the victory by holding the rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, currently losing four of the last five matches, are headed to Milton Keynes for the next match to be held on Friday.
Air traffic control died so that hundreds of people on board the plane could escape the earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously promoted as a hero after he knowingly went to death to enable a plane with hundreds of passengers to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared as a result of the severe earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday, which caused a tsunami.
Strong underground shocks continue to destroy the area, and many residents of the city of Palu are under the rubble of buildings.
Although his colleagues escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the horrifying control tower of Mutyar Sis Al Jufri Airport, city of Palu.
He remained at his location to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321 aircraft, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
Then when he thought the tower was collapsing, he jumped off it.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian aeronautical representative Johannes Sirait stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News agency.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter could land in Pala.
"We are very sorry for this loss," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths from the earthquake may reach thousands, as, according to the disaster management agency, access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims is likely to rise, as a large number of people are still under debris and many have never been able to get out of there," says a representative of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
Waves as high as six metres devastated the city of Palu, where a mass burial of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, and a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News, "Emergency brings the victims every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are all over the place."
Jan Helfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, tells CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is already rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know they'll be there.
The tragedy has already taken on quite serious proportions, but everything can be much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pala on Sunday and addressed the country's armed forces, inter alia, saying, "I'm asking you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?", says CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports one person missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which was on a flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person was missing, whereas it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sinking plane.
Air Niugini reports that as of Saturday afternoon, she has no information about one male passenger.
The airline stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and the police to find this person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about a passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and crew after he fell to the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all are in stable condition.
The reasons for the plane crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the United States Navy claim that the aircraft landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft was unable to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes says the plane started entering the runway too low.
"And that's very good," Janes adds.
Janes told me that he and other passengers managed to get to the emergency exits on a sinking plane because the water level was up the belt.
He also said that stewardesses were panicking and screaming on board, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that sailors repairing the wharfs nearby also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat on which they brought people ashore before the aircraft sank about 30 metres (100 feet) under the water.
Air Safety Network data show that 111 people have died in air crashes with PNG-registered companies over the past two decades, but none of these accidents were related to Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst was able to prove that a woman had been burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution instituted proceedings against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett gave long-hour testimony as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told members of the department how he used his cell phone records to produce an overview of the actions of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rawlett told me that he had received data on the whereabouts of these people from several mobile phones; according to this data, Tellys spent the night with Chambers, which contradicts his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the information received, his mobile phone was near Chambers; when this happened, the police questioned Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that "it's a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was that Tellys said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
However, according to phone records, they only called for one week.
Rawlett also testified that some time after Chambers Tellys' death, she removed her text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale says.
The defence must begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is "conscious hip hop"?
The hip-hoppers trio is going to fight negative attitudes to this genre by filling its music with positive content.
The High Breed band from Bristol claims that hip hop content has changed, moving away from the original political and social problems.
The band members want to go back to their roots and make "conscious" hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently witnessed a revival in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
The New York nanny sued the couple for racist texts.
The New York nanny sued the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a report from a woman complaining that the nanny was "another black" that the woman mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
The spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the lawsuit is filed with the "object of extortion".
Lincy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she learned that the new nanny offered by the childcare service, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman when she came to her family on her first day of work in 2016.
"She's just not that, just one more black," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flexman in a text to her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she sent it twice wrongly to Miss Maurice.
Aware of her misbehave, the "confusiond" Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, stating in the service that the nanny who turned out to be African-American did not do her job well, and in general that they were expecting a Filipino rather than an African-American, reports New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice now sues the couple and claims $350 a day's dismissal in six months, according to the terms of the original oral agreement, which, however, were not stipulated by any contract.
"I want them to understand: such things are unacceptable," she said "Post" on Friday, adding, "And I know it's discrimination."
The spouses disagree with the charge of racism and argue that Maurice's dismissal can be considered a reasonable step, as they would no longer be able to trust her if they offended her.
"My wife sent her in a message something she didn't really mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the husband, Joe Plasco, to the Post.
"But would you trust your children with someone you were rude to even if you were rude without wanting to?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Oh, come on!"
Calling the lawsuit "extradition", Plasco said that his wife gave birth only two months ago and found herself in "a very difficult situation."
"And you're willing to pursue a man in this position?
Not very nice of you," added a banker specializing in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already handed down its verdict on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behaviour and logic problems.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not understand the move with a talking bear, says the new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Yankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, so said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the work for the first time, even before it was published.
It's very funny to know that Paddington has a huge success."
She also said that her father, before he decided to write a children's book about the bear, worked as an operator on the BBC, and would have treated the refusal to publish with optimism, and added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication of his books was "and happy and bitter", as the author had not become available last year.
As for Paddington's bear himself, she refers to him as "a very important member of our family", and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually gained prominence.
"He was a quiet and humble man," his daughter says.
"Because Paddington was so real to him, and for his father it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of it, although he did not really consider this success his own merit.
I think that's how he treated Paddington's success.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear itself."
I had to say good-bye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Over regularly called and said it was really bad, something went wrong," says Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa.
"Then he called again and said that she would die within the next two minutes, and that we should say goodbye.
I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs that the doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually stopped working, leaving her body.
She died early than expected.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing everything was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself tight."
After all, Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa, grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, humbled by the enormous loss she had just suffered.
"No one around knew what happened," she says.
"My head has fallen, I never stopped crying.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nadia.
He was so in need of my love and support.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who have lost loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey place cards on the Welsh Bridge with comforting words and telephone numbers by which people can apply for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he began to be depressed, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to experience what I experience every day," she says.
45-year-old Davis, living in Leedney, tells me that her son was a great cook and had a damn charming smile.
"Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, it was like the light was on in the room."
However, before he died, he left work because he was going through a really scary time."
This happened in 2014, and the killed Tyler was found by his own brother, then 11 years old.
Mrs Davis says, "I don't stop fearing a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis came up with these postcards, "so people know there's someone to turn to and tell, even if it's your friend.
You can't sit there and be quiet, you have to talk to people."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband who had lived with him for 15 years — he was gone shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, upset, or anything like that," she says.
"A couple days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
At Christmas, he became particularly ill: he did not even look at the children when they opened their gifts."
She says his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to go through it, this event has shocked our family.
It tore her apart.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Brett Cavanaugh hangs in the balance: the FBI begins an investigation
"I thought if we could get something like what he asked for -- an investigation limited in time and volume, we could bring some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "breaking apart" against the background of a growing party chain reaction.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their hesitation.
The midterm elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November, and if — as expected — things are not going well for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the person they want and elect him as the supreme judge of the country.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying for support from Mr. Cavanaugh, who has worked for Mr. Bush at the White House since then, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife Ashley, who was then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report public?
There will be a Senate vote, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It was still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh would be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the issue of equality of votes and confirm his candidacy for the post of supreme judge.
The number of defectors from North Korea decreased at Kim
Since Kim Jong-eun came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined, a South Korean legislator stated.
Park Byung Seug, citing figures from the Southern Ministries, stated that compared to 2,706 escapes recorded in 2011, this figure decreased to 1,127 in the past year.
Mr. Park said that the key factors had been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates imposed by smugglers smuggling people.
Pyongyang has no public comment.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean defectors eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China viewed defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often subjected them to forced repatriation.
North-South relations, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to resume the stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This came after the June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-eun in Singapore, where they reached common agreements to disarm the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the United States of obstructing progress on this issue through their sanctions.
"If we do not have at least the slightest confidence in the US, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will in no way be able to begin disarmament unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical," and claims that he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader in the Nancy Pelosi House of Representatives named Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the post of supreme judge, "hysterical" and said that he was unfit for the Supreme Court because of her temperament.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival event in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave in this way, she would be immediately called "the hysterical," Pelosi says about her reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Law Committee, given to them on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blacey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment, which allegedly occurred when they were both still teenagers.
Cavanaugh performed emotionally enough, sometimes even screamed and suffocated about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee's Democrats, calling the charges against him "a grotesque and well-planned assassination of an actor", organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Cavanaugh merely confirmed by her testimony that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had a biased attitude towards Democrats.
"I think he disqualifys himself from his claims as well as the way he attacks the Clintons and Democrats," she says.
Pelosi was outraged when asked whether she would try to bring Cavanaugh to justice if his guilt was confirmed, and if Democrats received a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the trial he's on now," Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions on the Accessible Health Care Act or Row v. Wade, as he is considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearing of his candidacy, Cavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Now is not the time to let a hysterical and prejudiced man into the position of supreme judge, while exclaiming, 'How wonderful!' says Pelosi.
And women have to own it.
It's righteous anger, months and years of rage, she can't go through without crying.
"When we're angry, we cry," said Miss Steinham 45 later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think?"
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was working somewhere in a management position. She told me that she was crying as well when she was angry, but developed the technique by which she explained to her interviewer, "You might think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really angry."
And then she just kept talking.
I was impressed by this approach."
Tears are allowed as an exit for anger partly because they are fundamentally misread.
One of my most painful memories of my first work in an office dominated by men: one day I cried out of anger, but I was grabbed by a shiv by an old woman, a soulless manager, who I've always feared terribly, and dragged to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're crying out of anger.
They think you're upset, and they're excited, thinking they finally got you."
Patricia Schrader, then Democrat Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some minor affair and left the race, Ms. Schrader, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she should run for president.
"This decision was not well thought out," she admitted to me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called that case Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
The campaign was already coming to an end, it was heavily behind in fund-raising, and so she vowed she would not participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It seemed to be a totally losing option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 each to men, offered her only 250.
"What am I, a priced commodity to them?" she wondered.
When she gave a speech announcing that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was so enthralled by emotions — thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and access voters, and anger over gender discrimination that she suffocated.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown," recalls Ms. Schrader about how the press reacted to it.
"It could have been thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what are they going to write on my monument?
"She was crying all the time"?
How a Trade War with America Can Be Good for Beijing
Experts believe that the first rounds of the US-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, the divisions between countries can benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, made the first warning earlier this year, taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminium.
The largest escalation occurred this week, when new tariffs affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has dealt equivalent counter-attacks each time, recently imposing $60 billion worth of duties on US goods of between 5 and 10 per cent.
China has promised that the response against the US will be equivalent every time, and the world’s second largest economy is unlikely to begin to experience at least the slightest difficulty in the near future.
Making Washington retreat means giving in to demands, but publicly giving in to the US would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, the US trade war pressure can provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that an early political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to economic stump in any of these countries is in fact far more dangerous than previously acknowledged by observers," says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security, specializing in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “ready” for the return of refugees
Syria stated that it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and was seeking assistance in rebuilding a country that had been devastated by a war that had lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem reported that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and secure thanks to successes in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live there in peace.
At present, all conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they have had to leave because of the terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance on any terms or from countries that sponsored terrorism.
Europe secures victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the United States team with a final score of 16.5–10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times on European soil, and the European Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe regained its crown thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, who scored the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, made his first long-range hit in the water on the 16th hole of steam-3, yielding his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds, becoming the 1st to 4th players who ever walked 5-0-0, as the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Sleep was defeated by a 5:4 player with the lowest ranking in the European team, Turbier Olesen of Denmark.
One of the world's best players, Dustin Johnson, gave up 2:1 to Jan Polter of England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup last time.
Spanish Sergio García, veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, won the tournament in the history of Europe with 25.5 points per career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get the cup again.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help," says emotional Garcia after a European victory.
He hands the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with a 2–1 score in a single game.
"I feel incredible pride for this victory – I grew up watching Tiger Woods play," says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These indicators are rather strange for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, giving only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend, in vain trying to succeed. The exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who showed golf to the highest class throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furik said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We managed to talk a little bit about Europe this morning.
It didn't work.
We take our hats off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played excellently.
We regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward to succeed.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be able to lose.
We lost."
Red tide: News Concentration of microorganisms decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
A recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reflects an overall decrease in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to FWC, in Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier districts, abundant flowering is reported, indicating a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red tide extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from the northern Pinell to the southern districts of Lee.
The ochagi can be observed about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsboro County, but their number has declined significantly since last week.
Red tide is also observed in Pascoe County.
Last week, average concentrations were reported in and near Pinellas County, from low to high concentrations in the coastal area of Hillsboro County, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasota districts and coastal zones, average concentrations in Charlotte County, high concentrations on the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier, there is still a possibility of respiratory irritation.
Northwestern Florida didn't report this possibility last week.
