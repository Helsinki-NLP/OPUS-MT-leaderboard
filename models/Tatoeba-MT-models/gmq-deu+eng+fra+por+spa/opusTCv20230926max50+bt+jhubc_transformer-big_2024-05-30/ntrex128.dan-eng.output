Politicians in Wales afraid to "look like fools"
There was dismay among some members of the Welsh National Assembly over a proposal that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to plans to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could give rise to ridicule.
A Labour member said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means crap.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a brief verbal leap from the MWP to the Muppet (fool).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently putting together a bill to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on the names that members of parliament will get is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, in which there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP opportunity was most supported in a public consultation.
AMs seem to suggest alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement may prove difficult for the chairman of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The bill on the reforms includes other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs get the final vote on what they should be called when the bill is debated.
Macedonians vote to change name of country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour’s name constitutes a claim to Greece’s territory and has long protested Macedonia’s attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the vote and says he will overturn the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's are quiet while the churches in Harlem fight
"The older people I have spoken to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr. Adams said.
“Today there is neither.”
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
“People are socializing in other ways nowadays,” he said.
“Bars no longer constitute the living rooms of the neighborhood, where people enter on a daily basis.”
In relation to churches, he worries that the money collected from selling assets will not last long and that they “sooner or later will be back where they started.”
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes full of the kind of people who don’t help the neighborhood’s recurring retreats.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condos in these buildings are white,” he says, “and it further inflates the trend where these churches eventually close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the condos will become members of the churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which had functioned nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem that would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to restore the building, they ordered the bell.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell the bell of the poor.
The expert who played the bell in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's couldn't find a replacement for him.
What has taken place in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some caught up by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The parish council – the parish’s leading body of leading laymen – wrote to the diocese in July about concerns that the diocese “would try to push expenses” to the parish council, even though the parish council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent in.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on diving trip after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just excitement to have caught a lobster, but then he realized the boy was yelling, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
"His collarbone was torn open," said Hammel, as he saw the boy.
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported in critical condition.
It is unclear which species of shark attacked.
Lifeguard Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to capture the UK beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow as fashion and home products decline. The larger ranks of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in several stores next year if they prove successful.
The investment in beauty products is taking place as supermarkets are looking for new products for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s says they are doubling their range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are being introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching the range of Boutique makeup, so the majority of products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly being demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop is testing stalls in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon in the south of London last week and the second opening in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a trend towards buying small amounts of food daily at local grocers mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores will look like department stores as the supermarket chain takes on the deal with discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since they bought both chains two years ago. These initiatives have boosted their groceries sales and have made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempts to update the beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 00s, but the collaboration ended with a quarrel about how the earnings from supermarket pharmacies should be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our range of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the enticing environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a compelling destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of deal to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones left "enraged" after TV host Holly Willoughby resigns from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for their housing products and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones furious after retiring from their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “infuriated” when the popular TV woman during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she no longer had enough time for their home products and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly while Jones flew out of the UK to one of his vacation rentals.
One source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she had to deal with for the next few decades.
Her decision to resign surprised everyone involved.
Nobody would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the announcement by This Morning host, one of the UK’s highest-grossing stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in products – ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further launch delays.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby formed Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, took office as chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin who hosted I'm a Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business initiatives."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment that "is not worthy of a president" and for being so positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his parody of a news host.
“I gave up nothing.”
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “similar response” from the US to North Korea’s initial efforts to disarmament.
He noted that instead the US is continuing with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure going.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in his speech at the polls.
“North Korea is doing very well,” he said.
"There were signs of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his attempts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results – ending rocket tests, helping with the release of hostages and the repatriation of the remains of American military men.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastate island and kill hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population was left homeless, no national emergency was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international relief.
"In many cases, it has unfortunately been clear that they are not requesting international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children puts together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Response Service, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Due to the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly subjected to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
A warning had been issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunamisir is missing, and it has probably affected the death toll.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia’s inadequate infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding in line with the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko is also experiencing pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bow and arrow and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sets off last-minute match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind by 1-0.
He hit the ball with his left foot before making a high shot at the farthest pole.
The ball flew high over the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in that position, getting the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far forward as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I made a single touch. I didn't think much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea striker handed his heel back to Mateo Kovacic before speeding up to midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in midfield.
He then made a long pass that brought Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and finished to the farthest pole with a shot with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face off against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country’s disaster response agency said on Sunday.
Many were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings that fell after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Officer Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would urge anyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have recorded something with the dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that could be crucial to the investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but is told by police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was stunned when he heard what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will be several hours before they can get back in.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman arrives.
She keeps repeating, "It's so terrible."
At 2 p.m., there were two police cars inside the cordon and another car just outside.
A number of police officers stood within the cordon and monitored the apartment complex.
Anyone with information please write a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and provide log 247 on 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the latest memorial to be hit by debate on "rewriting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical, Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable, in the context of the current debate on the removal of statues, that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a target.
The image storm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's stunning depiction of Cromwell is a testament to attitudes in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate representation is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of tribute and commemoration.”
Man attacked and killed Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a torn artery and smeared in blood near a pigsty at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines to pigs at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pigsty next door was open.
He said there was a big boar in the pigsty with blood in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and wounded," said the cousin, who goes by the surname "Wu," in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Footage from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police gather evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
This is rare, but there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer smashed a pig weighing 295 kg at his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
“They are just playful.
They nap, they're very curious... they're not looking to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to cause heavy rains in much of the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will cause heavy rains with flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 38 m/s, a Category 1 hurricane, at 10am Sunday (Danish time) and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture northwards into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the tropical moisture will interact with the approaching low-pressure outlet, creating heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm surges, floating fallout and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical humidity will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a high likelihood of storm surges with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into rumbling rivers and thunderstorms will create strong local winds and create dust blasts.<0x3C>/seg>
The approaching low-pressure effluent will cause heavy rains along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of more than 13 mm, which can result in smaller amounts of floating fallout and slippery roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in their rainy season.
Scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners area Tuesday and continue Wednesday.
In October, there may be large temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic gets cooler, but it remains reasonably warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start to October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern areas.
There could be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that there is a high likelihood of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million watched Thursday’s stirring testimonies from the nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations interrupting the regular programs to report on Friday’s late developments: an agreement put together by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was drunk and was trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he is 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw it Friday.
The company recorded average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available ratings from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people watch programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it’s a viewership equivalent to a game during the NFL playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-based hosts have strongly backed the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning while protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the hearing in the judicial committee.
He stood with a downward-looking look for several minutes as he was scolded and CNN broadcast live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, saying before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing in the committee.
All television stations covered live a few hours later, as the judiciary was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a Senate-wide vote.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee the following week, which the Democrats, who are outnumbered in the Senate, had requested.
Flake was partially convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators subsequently, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s election had an impact because it was clear that Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside that of Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson put forward her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “completely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Responsible for LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost their glasses during the match.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on it, CBS subsidiary WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had confessed to the shooting on Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner released a preliminary report Friday saying that the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot wound going from the head to the neck.
The police department said a task force from Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, Southern University police and residents of the area assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the police for their “care and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm tall forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crushed" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"That's the kind of thing you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spewing ash over Mexico City
Ash vomited from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater, and 183 spills of gas and ash were recorded over the course of 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumbling and shaking over several laps.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrators seeking independence clashed with unrest police officers as several thousand took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarising secession referendum.
A group of masked separatists held back unrest officers, threw powder paints and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also fights later in the day, when police used their spells to keep the fighting down.
For hours, independence groups shouted “Nothing Forgotten, Nothing Forgotten” and were met with Unionist protesters shouting “Long live Spain.”
14 people received treatment for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
The atmosphere remains tense in the independence-minded region one year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal from Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but voter turnout was low, and those opposed to the secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the holding of the vote during violent clashes at polling stations throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dares hope that Catalonia can achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy at being given the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although they won a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders are either themselves moving into exile or in detention awaiting verdict for their role in holding the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on her phone in support of the police, saying the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
“There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have awaited his trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"The nomination in the European elections is the best way to denounce the setback in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga wins Livingston 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston
Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference as Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s team has not won out of the league this season and will face the leading team Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
The Rangers will receive a visit from Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston expands their undefeated streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses out on cash
Holt’s team should have been ahead long before they scored, and their direct playing style created big problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but passed across in front of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside of the goal after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-header in front of the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could cause the away team problems in deadball situations.
And it was in those circumstances that the important goal came.
Declan Gallagher and Robinson created Menga, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but struggled to get through the home team's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unchallenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was averted with his feet by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's deadball situations.
Running passes came into Livingston's field, but were averted, and two penalties—after Halkett's tackle on substitute Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball—were rejected.
"Phänomenally" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played great and exceeded expectations on their upward journey.
Their playing style and squad have remained largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he joined.
There were a lot of heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They have at times been really good under Gerrard, but they played below level.
Their finishes lacked sharpness – only once did they uncover the home team – and that is an abrupt awakening for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the leaderboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
Disagreements have arisen over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's rapprochement with the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
The city has the largest population outside Turkey.
Police held for security reasons a crowd of 25,000 from congregating in front of the mosque, but plenty of supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also took notice and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero by some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat by others.
Deptford accident: cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest of the city around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and there were rescuers at the scene, but the man died at the scene.
The accident happened a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled the scene, on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road barriers have been set up, bus routes have been rescheduled and motorists are encouraged to stay out of the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured During Unrest
Six prison guards were injured in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
Unrest arose in the prison of HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST on Sunday, and the unrest is still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers are brought in to deal with the riots, which involve eight inmates and take place in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the ongoing unrest in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may end up spending longer time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden was being treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot officers were summoned to the prison to deal with serious unrest in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm surges (dry areas may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape in the southwestern United States, creating the risk of storm surges.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of storm surges for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had retained tropical storm or depression status within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 50 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with insulated amounts up to 152 mm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get 25 to 51 mm with the option of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of storm surge, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Floods are a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will be useful because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, the second-highest category," reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum wind speeds of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore decreases in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical currents Monday afternoon or evening.
The rains over parts of Mexico can become heavy and pose a high risk of flooding.
"Precipitation is expected at a total of 76 to 152 mm from Baja California to northwestern Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona early in the morning Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the United States," the National Hurricane Center reported.
The rain is expected to cause life-threatening storm surges and floating fallout in deserts as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition was reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
Officers have urged anyone who may have cellphone footage of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh succumbed to Democratic Party 'evil and anger'
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party's ruthless and monstrous tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been exposed to “the evil, the wrath” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, denying strongly and emotionally allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his charges.
The president said Saturday that the “American people saw the skill, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service,” he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republicans appearing at the polls in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important choices of our lives will be made.
You can’t vote for me, but you actually vote for me,” he said.
“That’s why I travel around and fight for great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to “strike back and block.”
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a senior Republican party official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll grows
At least 384 were killed, many of them washed away by huge waves hitting the beach when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Several hundred people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu Friday, when up to six-meter-high waves hit the coast at dusk, sucking many in death, and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake that measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still engaged in activities on the beach; they did not run immediately and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster response service BNPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
More people managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The disaster preparedness team has published aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftermath continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Board (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during Friday’s major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found trapped under the debris of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and that 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300-kilometre-long coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their employees and volunteers are heading for the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The board was criticized on Saturday from many fronts for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had come within the time period when the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings about the tsuami coming closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun to send cargo planes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but food and basic necessities are still urgently needed among the evacuated.
The city’s airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesian tsunami kills more than 800 people.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have come safely to Palu city, where employees seek shelter under tarpaulins set up in the courtyard at their account. They came past areas of extensive destruction along the way, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of broken houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even as relief organizations began the hard work of putting relief work back on, there were complaints that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and staff from abroad may only enter if the area where the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘OK, it’s a national disaster’, we can open up for international assistance, but there’s no status yet.”
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people held fast in the hope that their loved ones would become the miracles that brighten the grim tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of those caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mondayi, were among his students.
“As a veteran of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told how in class, after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to participants in Palu who were attending the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, resulted in only one grey tick instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he says.
Thieves take 26,750 USD while refilling ATM in Newport on the Levee
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was about to meet an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not say how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the thieves, please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, writing, "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place prior to his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist's name, but West has previously said that the name has religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West’s former collaborators, JAY-Z, has also switched between lowercase and uppercase letters and changed whether or not the hyphen is included.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador vowed at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when leftist student movements took root in many parts of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have issued statements about artificial intelligence. However, the U.S. still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced its plan last year and aims to take the lead in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we’re looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next major achievement in artificial intelligence being achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published his book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google’s department in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when there will be a new competition so that the next visionaries can be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain grants from the government, Lee says.
"It's not China that grabs the academic leaders, it's the big corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically have been offered work permits.
The Chinese government released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a manner similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations’ distribution of money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, U.S. legislation seeking to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote to change name of country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbour to the north constitutes a claim on Greek territory, and has therefore used their veto power when Macedonia has sought accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primarily Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the electorate will represent the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to allow access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough members of parliament have said that they will abide by the result of the vote and assert it.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said that at 1 p.m. there were no reports of irregularities.
But the turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children; we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a constituent in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change of the country's name that would open up membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and pulled chairs up in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we will achieve membership with our heads up, not by the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will vote in favour because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said that a ‘yes’ result would be a ‘secure of our future’.
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the poll — fewer than the required turnout.
Another poll by Macedonian television channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50% plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero fights through Brighton's defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score, which came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before swinging out onto the open court.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought his way past one defender, and subsequently ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a pass to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to outsmart Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League game.
The goal came after 29 minutes.
In that sequence, Aguero received the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a handsome pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling to the farthest pole.
The Sky Blues forward dotted the ball into the net just before it slipped past the goal.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to tease the Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn’t have much to fight for.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the pitching line on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still the opportunity to participate in the playoffs for the Rockies, who have played one game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least held onto a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still have their first division title in hand.
"While we have nothing to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver and that the opponents would play at the probably highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn’t I be excited to play in those conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the start lineup for Sunday, but are likely to put Scherzer in as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be first man on the spot for the 34th time, trained his throws Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-hander from Washington is at 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds poll in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republicans appearing at the polling stations in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
It’s one of the big, big ones – you can’t vote for me, but you actually vote for me. That’s why I travel around and fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see it’s happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by every means at their disposal. You can see how vicious, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have as their mission "stride against and block".
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angerous and vicious and disgusting and lying."
He mentioned the top Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, by name, which triggered the loud buh from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, wait – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer an inclusive party.
They are intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a large number of Labour MEPs who have been told that we are not welcome – simply because we have made our views known.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship measure was to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar issues, which Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
The summons to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said, “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, the sittings on Friday evening have been exactly like this.
Today, unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not that, and the promise of 'kinder, gentler' policy is far back in the past, if it ever got under way.
It has become increasingly clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed according to whether the party leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a political point of view began to expect that I would make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was about national security or the EU’s internal market.
When I express my opinion in public – and that doesn’t really matter what I say – a long line of rough messages follow on social media that call for the opt-out and contradiction of the midterm politics and tell me that I shouldn’t be a Labour member.
And that’s not just my experience.
In fact, I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have deep respect for the professionalism and combativeness of those colleagues who are overwhelmed every day with sexism or racism, but still fight on.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
But in reality it is no longer an inclusive organization and with every vote of no confidence or change in the selection rules the party becomes narrower.
I’ve been given plenty of advice over the past two years that if I put a lid on myself and don’t shout so loudly, I’ll “get by.”
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago when I was in school, I was provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government that had left our classroom in ruins, and I set out to create better public services for those who need it most—whether as a councilman or minister in the government.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the resolution on Friday, I would say that as the country swings towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the local voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of opt-out or political suitability will deter me from acting on the basis of what I believe is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr becomes top team
Two late scorings may have led to the final result drawing an untruthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this fantastically entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the leaderboard and are the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their better use of chance that carried the home team home, and coach Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our matches have been demanding so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Respect to Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute scoring was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card to Scottish national team Rory Hughes, dealt to the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a scoring that was not followed by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before the half, scoring and then scoring a solo score, leaving Ayr 17–5 at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out of the field on a stretcher. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded the lead with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Clima.
Acting Ayr captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Clima without the ball, MacPherson was able to after a line-out score behind the forward Ayr Cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick within the poles and followed up with another almost immediately after the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent wingman Gregor Henry off to the home field's fifth scoring.
Still Game star looking for new career in the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be taking the step into the catering industry after it came to light that he has taken over the directorship of an authorized restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main character of along with his collaborator Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but one source suggested to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": Inland state of Bolivia hopes that court will reopen route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol around the naval headquarters, wrapped in rifles, in La Paz.
On public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are painted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It is our duty to take it back.”
Throughout the landlocked state of Bolivia, the memory of a stretch of coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still strong, as is the longing to sail the Pacific again.
Hopes may be at their highest for decades, while Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course awaits with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country and hope that the court in The Hague will agree that Chile – after decades of discussions – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake in his sentence on Monday.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will take the side of Bolivia – and that there would not be much change if it did.
The UN Assembly, which is based in the Netherlands, has no power to override Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice renders its verdict only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia’s cause, the past four years may have been a setback.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales's bellicose rhetoric has put an end to the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreements and achieve benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not first rely on Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by promises made at a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a resumption of nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "dream" that continuing sanctions and the United States' opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare as long as Pyongyang has not first taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal that it most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headgear that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled on the catwalk a collection of extra-large headgear as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work from Valentino was a lavish one with a feather-like broad shadow covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra-large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn together lips that resembled more Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations looked like diving gear with a snorkel and a mask, while others looked like a melted waffle ice cream.
And if you continue the big fashion statements, you’re in luck.
Style scouts predict that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The giant hats arrive on the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 centimeter wide shadow seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat spread across social media has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw almost as large as the model that displays it.
The orange bast bag with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in regular stores next summer. The designer has had so much influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for huge-sized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have many great academic achievements behind them, and it has continued in 2018 with yet another series of outstanding graduation achievements, which are further enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
With up to 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can put together and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we find that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it hits the heart.”
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see from the latest exam results this year that languages are highest in the statistics with the most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS’ 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a grade of A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now perceived as subject choices at the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in independent schools’ curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers could not fill vacancies, 17% had to do with lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a head start over the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 people in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language teaching for those who are children today.
Speaking multiple languages, especially languages from developing countries, gives children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, there is a difference between schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from at independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that language continues to be truly important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes his debut for the Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s opening game before the start of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It’s not yet clear how many minutes he’s playing.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will most likely not play the whole game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in relation to the Lakers' scheduled six games before the start of the season.
"Where I am in my career, I don't need games before the start of the season to get ready," he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first out of five scheduled polling sessions next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm Trump’s nominee for the vacant seat on the Supreme Court is suspended, Trump is trying to create support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump’s poll in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held at midnight on the night of Saturday, November 29, and Sunday, November 30, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s poll in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely be talking about this week’s hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court. The hearings were tense due to sexually abusive behavior allegations, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation has been suspended for a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
But the primary goal of this streak of voter rallying is to create momentum for those Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump’s campaign team said the five polls next week aim to “create energy among volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Control over Congress is so important to his agenda that the president wants to travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign time," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, told Reuters.
Tonight’s meeting is held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the media from Pittsburgh,” according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican candidate for Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to step up to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown match spirit and is trying to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles duels
After three one-sided laps, Saturday’s four-man duels were perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this.
Where would they say there is momentum now?
“They led by six points, and now it’s four, so we’ll probably see that as a bit of momentum,” Spieth said.
Europe, of course, has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead and there are 12 more points to play for.
However, as Spieth says, Americans feel a little windy and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both boast three points out of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The loud shouts of applause grew louder as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important put, securing victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two shots behind after two duels.
His put who secured them the match at hole 15 was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows he doesn’t think the American team is out of the competition yet.
"You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your own struggle," Spieth said.
That’s all the players have now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the biggest story from the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange but sympathetic couple have scored four points in four games and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way in which the energy apparently flows both to and from the wild audience show that it is those who will be the hardest to beat on Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory is settled by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably synchronized on each hole.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief process against Sergio Garcia, the morning of the four-man duels when he paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and Swede into a hole they were never close to getting out of.
No one will be able to help you out of your hole.
The matches with four balls and two teams of two players are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change quickly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man duels have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 ahead of last day of Ryder Cup
Europe has a big advantage before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the United States of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and has so far scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's European team, trying to win the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an imprecise American team in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes. They won four games, but were still behind.
Jim Furyks team will need eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches if they are to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who have been nicknamed "Molliwood", are after a sensational weekend the only second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their first four games.
They smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a discouraged Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought his way through the first two games Saturday, had small ingenious glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and got a 2-1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – who is number three in the world.
Europe, however, has it quite the way they want it, on a slightly windy day southwest of Paris.
Triple-major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They earned a hard-won 2–1 victory over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being four points behind before the singles matches. As Furyks currently have the trophy, however, they only need to tie to keep it.
After being second best for two days, however, it appears that they cannot master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally if there is no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are intensifying their mistrust of the United States and that the country will not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the worldwide organization’s General Assembly that North Korea had shown “significant goodwill” over the past year, for example, by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling an area for nuclear tests and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps, his speech seemed important, however, as it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament, as has previously been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean War that took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to softening harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’ and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by coercion and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream come true among people who don’t know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions reinforce our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a summit between Kim and Trump any more, as the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the past five months, adding: "If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so stalemate."
Nonetheless, the tone of Rice’s speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea’s rockets at the US mainland was inevitable, after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened at the UN with “total destruction” of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in terms of disarmament, but said there is still much to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a timetable for these actions, but said “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must uphold sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, while North Korea just hours later accused him of making "gangster-like demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to close a missile facility as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took “similar steps.”
He said Kim had told him that the “similar steps” he demanded were the security promises made by Trump in Singapore, as well as movements toward a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep. The aim of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture, where you study all night long supported by large amounts of caffeine.
A researcher has shown that students at the world’s best university often have no idea the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a presentation about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“When the presentation was finished, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why do I only get to know this now that I’m on the candidate?’
“She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleeping habits can improve one’s academic and sporting performance as well as one’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the university’s health field, said the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that students were in severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course consists of, among other things, various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a dorm room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to get knowledge about the effects of caffeine and light, and how one’s sporting performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important good sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on various icons on an interactive map of the campus.
“We know that it won’t change the behavior of students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health," Professor Czeisler adds.
The pride in taking an “allnighter” still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
The “secret weapon” against stress, exhaustion and anxiety is good and sufficient sleep, he said – it even discourages weight gain because sleep deprivation makes the brain think you’re starving, which is why they’re constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, last year helped Professor Czeisler organize the course when he took one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and had him work on making it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that next, all graduates will be offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of light from electronic screens, which can shift the circadian rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals from Menga lower Gerrard and co.
The Rangers suffered another defeat away when Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's incoherent team had to settle for a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team from Ibrox were looking for their first away win since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard only a second defeat in 18 games as a coach, leaving eight points up to Hearts in first place of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond to.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, while Livingston climbs to third place behind Hibernian with only the goal score.
And there could be more bad news on the way to the Rangers as line judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that seemed to come from the away section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the line-up that reached the Betfed Cup semi-finals by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, scored the same 11 who shaved a point off Hearts' lead last week, and he would have rejoiced to see his sharp team exhaust the opponents all over the pitch.
The Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more efficient.
They should have scored two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt failed.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs found his way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow kicked past the rear pole.
The Rangers, however, took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was certainly not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's appeals for a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless clashed after a quarter of a game.
The Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Although Livi’s opening in the 34th minute was somewhat random, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, the Rangers could not handle a deadball situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga, who could easily kick it into the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave paws when the wingman sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the outside team to play on their terms with many long balls up the field from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have extended the lead in the final part of the game, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a secure hand before Lithgow headed off goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again appealed for a late penalty kick after being knocked out with Jacobs, but referee Thomson also looked the other way.
Yearbook: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we count... – was the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a staple of both science and popular culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as peasant scientists:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals makes."
Evans: "Oh, come on, it's on!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to 'See' Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to 'See' Cancer Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then “see” the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine performs promisingly in patients with a variety of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “causes several cancers to develop,” including breast, ovarian, lung and bowel cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells out of patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
After an incoherent performance in the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West was bowed off when he paid tribute to U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would run for president in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again cap, he began a rally against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
“I talk so often to white people who say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s racist?’
But if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started tonight's show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Although the footage was not shown, comedian Chris Rock West uploaded the tirade on social media.
It's unclear if Rock tried to show West by posting the footage.
West also complained to the audience about bad treatment backstage because of his headwear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, ‘Don’t go out there with that hat on.’
They bullied me!
And they said I had sunk deep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how deep I'm sunk?", saying that he would put on his Superman coat because it means "You can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try it with love.”
The audience booed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reported, commenting from a person present: "There was a toll in the studio."
West had been booked to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing the song I Love It while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the Conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR NOT LEAKING THE PUPLE."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West just “is the way he is, and that’s just fine.”
But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes, or supporting his “art”) who embraces and sheds an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so do we,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced that he had taken the name change to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife last Friday at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be tried in Belfast on Monday.
The charges are reviewed by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is out for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for wielding swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor is hitting out at the stereotypical macho hero, saying that those kinds of TV characters mean that young men often feel that they have to be hard to be respected.
Kit told Sunday Times Culture that he believes "something went wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem is with him "very close".
“At the moment, I care a lot – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?” he said.
“If we look at the current problems, what have we taught young men in their upbringing?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the highly masculine characters.
He continued, “What is born, and what is learned?
What is it that young men learn from television and the streets that makes them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
It is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young people.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he won't make sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he's "done with battlefields and horses".
Kit stars from November in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film director and his thief brother.
The actor recently revealed that he regards meeting his wife Rose as the best thing about the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so that way it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women sooner or later because of the country’s conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to lack of contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged free and equal access to HIV medicines as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that the allegations originated from websites and supporters of the “extreme right.”
"Lies, lies and more terrible lies," Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information reportedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted online on Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed to the information being posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters' staff, writes The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a direct lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is utterly untrue and a direct lie.”
Waters’ announcement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that she doesn't have the right temperament to be a Congressman.
If you are accused of something you have not done, do not be angry.
You must not become defiant.
The motives of the prosecutor must not be questioned.
You have to keep your peace of mind."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take Waters’s place in the midterm elections, also made his voice heard on Twitter.
"Great, if that's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she said her staff had contacted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement regarding these fraudulent allegations."
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are found," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to anyone on my staff."
Johnny English strikes again – underwhelming spy comedy starring Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British touch, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English - born anew.
Will dare, sarcastic self-satire, about how grim things are with us, become the country's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes has got his permission to make roars renewed again. His name signals more than anything that he is a comic invention aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the dumb-ass secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean, and proper clap of him who performed a single note to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international sneaky suit that left chaos in its wake after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this latest shot on the trunk of JE.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comedy, but the humour feels pretty underwhelming and strangely superfluous, especially now that more "serious" movie series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer compelling comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be geared toward children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English’s crazy adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film foolishness in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current point of departure for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England’s top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the dismay of the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last chance for a pompous and combat-ready prime minister who is already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there’s not much to work on in the script.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been revealed, she is forced to revoke someone's pension.
And of course it's the clumsy Johnny English, who is now the school superintendent of an upper-class school, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for some kind of School of Rock education in espionage.
English is rushed back to an emergency meeting at Whitehall and reunites with his hard-tested former right hand Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now married an over-enthusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain – a role that Vicki Pepperdine is wasted on.
Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is stumbling close to being flattered by the charismatic and creepy tech billionaire Jason Volta – played by Jake Lacy – who claims to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky escapades: disguised as servants, they set fire to a distinguished French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates sheer ragnarok as he tries to wear virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired in the film's closing sequence, but as well-meaning and energetic as it is, there is a sense of children's television about it.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn’t help thinking with the other Johnny English movies: Can’t the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does his talent justice?
Labour Rejects Four-Day Work Week Plan with Unchanged Salary
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour is said to be considering a radical plan so that the British can settle for a four-day work week, but get paid for five.
The party allegedly wants business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that the employees would have three days’ weekend without cutting their salary.
Sources state that the idea would be consistent with the party’s economic goal of pulling the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party told The Sunday Times: “A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year.”
“It’s not going to happen in a day, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits with the party’s approach to changing the economy for the benefit of workers and to the party’s overall strategy for industry.”
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the campaign for the 2017 parliamentary elections.
This is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not the party’s policy and is not under consideration in the party.”
Labour shadow finance minister John McDonnell used last week’s party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to rip power back from “anonymous directors” and “exploiters” in utilities.
The shadow finance minister’s plans also cast doubt on whether the current shareholders of water supply companies will get their money back, as a government headed by Labour could “compensate” them on the basis of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to get workers on company boards and to set up inclusive equity funds to distribute 10 percent of private companies’ equity to employees, who are expected to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their voice
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week. And it raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig out anything that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I entered the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened - after the allegations came out - and said, "Did you do that?"
He was strong, determined and clear.”
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, seems to be chiseled in stone.
“I’ve decided on Brett Kavanaugh and anything else would require a very violent accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see how that would change anything.”
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive array of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will raise awareness about the real goal, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Started in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy organization that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a series of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, writing to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful action that can raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, now that they have 12 years left to reach the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert create real change, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – that is, people feel they are making a difference by signing a petition online or making a Twitter post?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its members targeting various targets.
They believe that these actions have spurred world leaders to make binding targets and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 goals and actions resulting from their actions, amounting to over $10 billion that had already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that these funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Started in the UK, The Power of Nutrition is a collaboration between investors and actionable individuals who strive to “help children live their full potential” and pledge $35 million to alleviate nutritional problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the British government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, the social injustice of malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books,” said the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now pledged funds to improve the nutrition of mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In response to one of the website's frequently asked questions, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the movements against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will be the hosts.
US could use its navy to 'block' Russian energy exports, US interior secretary says
"If necessary," Washington can use its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s interference in Syria – especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for expanding the sales of its energy.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The United States has the ability with our fleet to ensure that there is free passage on the sea routes and, if it becomes necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not get on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at a meeting of the Consumer Energy Alliance – a nonprofit organization that considers itself the “voice of the American energy consumer”.
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are essentially the same.
"The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase European exports of liquefied natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, spokesmen for the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, has made Berlin Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is purely due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose their supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met with criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the US to intervene beyond the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party interfering in our energy supplies," said the head of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is “strongly considering” running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is “strongly considering” running for president after the midterm elections, she said Saturday.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front," she said.
"After November 6, I will strongly consider running for president."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been voiced in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course, the FBI will investigate the matter before the vote."
A poll from Thursday shows that most of Warren’s own backers don’t think she should run for office in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator shouldn't run.
32 per cent supported the possible candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick with 38% for and 48% against a possible lineup.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates discussed in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden announced his decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's PTSD at a Donald Trump poll
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son goes through after he returns home allows me to relate to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and other injuries our soldiers are returning home with,” she told the audience at a Trump poll in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and have become harder. They go and think if there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, for obstructing the report of domestic violence, and for being in possession of a weapon while intoxicated, Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennet said.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. law that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a party-independent statement in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, NBC News said.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal law has not been made public.
She said her partner "and his abusive sons who are gang members" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers originated, as countries with far-reaching problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law overturned a decision by the U.S. Immigration Commission in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia attorney general, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new law "disregards decades of state, federal and international law."
“The federal law requires all asylum applications to be determined on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against that principle,” the statement said.
The attorneys also argued in the statement that the law on rejection of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as there is a higher probability that they will become self-employed and "provide the necessary labour."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions denied immigration judges the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political stance," Sessions said in his ordinance of the law on June 11.
Asylum has never been meant to solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people all over the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, the search for survivors in Palu becomes desperate.
For the survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her little fever-stricken boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We need clean water.”
The residents now returned to their destroyed homes to sort into soaked possessions and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, also affected by the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to keep up.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients are being treated outdoors due to heavy aftershocks.
He had tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was crushed against a broken wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was going to a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of bad practices and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper that drummed for the benefits of US-Chinese cooperation, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid indentation into the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of interfering in November 6’s congressional elections.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump’s accusation of Chinese interference in the U.S. election marks a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, in which they have repeatedly imposed tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliation tariffs in the trade war were supposed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican party, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, former U.S. ambassador to China for a number of years in Iowa, a major exporter of agri-foodstuffs to China, said Beijing has harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an editorial in Sunday’s Des Moines Register that China is “escalating the use of the ugly methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the proud American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the kiosks here in Beijing, you will find few disagreeing votes, and you will not get a true picture of the Chinese people's different attitudes to China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under tight control by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which one.
Republicans alienate women ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
While many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn they will see a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The case has put the emotion to a boil, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This can't be done over," Grant Reher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubts that Republican Senator Jeff Flake’s (Arizona) request for an 11th-hour FBI investigation will mitigate anger voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted during a demonstration in the Senate, “November is coming!” when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
“People say it has already reached a high level; that’s right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swing voters in the suburbs and younger voters—18-29-year-olds—who rarely vote, despite not liking the president.”
Even before Ford's public accusations of the Supreme Court nominee's sexual assault, analysts had pointed out that it could backfire if Republicans continued with the nomination.
"It's become a mess for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final result, or whether Kavanaugh is held accountable; it’s also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, president of Priorities USA, a group that supports Democrats in getting elected, told the news channel.
But Americans seem to have divided opinions about who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the latter having a little more on their side.
A recent YouGov poll found that 41% of respondents believed Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh either presumably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez writes for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly molested her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party when they were both studying at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to make a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a new business that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology so people can create their own “personal online data collection” or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the online personal data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to bring together resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contract, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team aren’t talking to Facebook or Google about whether they should change it all completely, so all of their business models suddenly become redundant.”
"We're not asking for your permission."
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupts "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet being built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launching, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about the Internet's next term," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I celebrated
The Church of England's only priest who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in its hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Wann won the Order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's order-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery."
Later, he ran to the front line, leading his men with the "greatest manhood" before attacking an artillery-armed man alone and dismantling three guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "feel very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underscores the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine that you’ve stayed up all night to watch the star-studded Bellator 206 and then are denied the main event.
There were 13 games on the programme from San Jose, including six games on the main programme, and they were shown throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 in the morning, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to meet each other, viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake early in the morning for this particular battle.
A fan on Twitter described the move to a children’s cartoon as “a kind of sick joke.”
“According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., which is why they had to switch to children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president, when asked about the broadcast.
"'Pig Gurli', yes."
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will work to include English viewers in their future planning.
"When thinking about the rerun, I think we can make it work," Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock Sunday morning over there, and we won’t find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to fix it. We thought it was a technical fault.
In fact, it was the legislation.
I promise you, that won’t happen next time.
We're going to settle for five games instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minority" over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt less worthy than everyone else growing up because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he got into the larger classes that “everyone is not like me.”
When he was on Radio 4’s first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular host of the long-running radio show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was a guest on Laverne's first program, saying he felt "less worthy" than everyone else in his upbringing because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said: “Until today, the feelings of being worthy of memory and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they got to know his sexuality.
The dual Olympic bronze winner has become a high-profile LGBT advocate and used his participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for the decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The triple world champion said he had been "surprised" when he fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but told him that the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it’s hard to find someone the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when you go through so much at such a young age – he went to his first Olympics at age 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would all be about me winning a gold medal," he said.
“But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets for London 2012 – when he would sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it only occurred to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead.”
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – which had meant a lot during the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs will air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he must do something about his form if it is not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who sets a record by taking part in the competition for the 12th time, which takes place every two years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk due to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events for the United States as usual, the five-time big winner had to cheer and practice his game in the hopes of correcting the whips.
Even at the peak of his career, he did not have the straightest drive, which is why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the pitch at Le Golf National, where the long rough often penalizes lost shots.
And if the pitch wasn’t a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will face the ever-accurate winner of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 singles games start strong, Mickelson's game could be decisive.
Furyk expressed unsurprisingly confidence in his teammate.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a pat on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of faith in himself.”
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams in the past – and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought he was going to play more, but that's how it went and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, though Furyk said his presence contributes something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He contributes a lot more than just the game.”
Europe's captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows from experience that a solid lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup singles match can quickly become nerve-wracking.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but was about to be overtaken before the finish line with a victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only exactly won," says Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn after watching the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday to a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
Tomorrow, we're going to get it full of garbage.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that is where our focus is.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Satisfied with his players’ performance on a difficult course, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: “I don’t take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow, it is the individual performance that counts, and that is something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested on all parameters as a golfer.
That’s what players need to understand – bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, for he will also bring out the best in himself."
Jim Furyk hopes for better individual performances than in the partner game, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced turnarounds on the last day, first on the winning team in Brookline, before losing when Europe made "The Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said, when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players in 1999 before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to have a good start, like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.
Once momentum has found a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We put our teams together accordingly and put the players on the pitch in the order we like. We try to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the rebound and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the series.
"I chose this group of players in this order because I think it ensures us all the way through," Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said about his choice of singles players.
Germany's new warship launches again
The German navy’s newest frigate should have been ready in 2014 to replace Cold War warships, but the Germans have to wait at least another year due to technical problems and an escalating price, local media reported.
The deployment of the largest ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a spokesman from the military.
The ship was to become part of the fleet in 2014, but after-delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, are to replace the ageing frigates of the Bremen class.
It is known that they will have a powerful gun, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest frigates is a lesser need for maintenance: it should be possible to keep the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are supposed to make Germany appear as an overseas power – will already be obsolete when deployed.
The failed F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware failures" that rendered the warship unusable in combat situations.
Software failures were of particular importance, as the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – that is only half of that crew from the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's ability for future updates.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhineland-Palatinate" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the project, which includes training of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government's defence committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "is running out of deployment-ready ships."
The official said the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to join the fleet.
National Trust sneaks into the secret life of bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands tries to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and will help in the work on future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland’s National Trust and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of the bats throughout the season.
Data is also collected by NTS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the audio recordings will reveal the bat call frequencies and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
NTS Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes that the results reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the nests and reduce their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks by pets.
Bats are not actually blind.
But because they hunt mainly at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to locate insects and fly around obstacles.
Responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, NTS takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect nests and sometimes carry out rescue operations.
The organization has even created Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the Threave area of Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland’s bat species.
The area's guardian, David Thompson, says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and the whole good habitat.
There’s a lot you don’t know about bats, so working here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young, thus risking the extinction of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, bother or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to lend a hand.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don’t know how populations evolve.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him “fake news” and says that people “will promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, which brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that he paid her $375,000 to keep it a secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, criticizing the information as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or told the camera.
“They will promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called “an unforgivable disclosure of suspicions about the privacy sphere.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral depravity in a class similar to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to the filed report in the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident, saying he was “a good guy 99% of the time” gripped by “the one percent.”
The case documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly shamed".
The 34-year-old now says she will reverse the deal, as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the incident was supposed to have taken place, and this summer switched to Italian club Juventus for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturers
The UK “will regret it forever” if it lost its status as a leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily lower production at the plant in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said longer waits at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“As I see it, production will stop at our factory if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March,” said Burnaston CEO Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is related to supply chain risks in the event of an uncontracted withdrawal.
Toyota’s production runs on a tight schedule, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which the auto industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day of production at the Derbyshire plant, and then production would be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU was “combined to precisely avoid these border checks.”
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what have been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term, higher prices would reduce the factory’s competitiveness, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “be postponed another week” as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein looks over the shoulder of special prosecutor Robert Mueller during his investigation into Russian election interference, links between Trump’s supporters and Russia, and the president’s possible obstruction of the court.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and thereby risk Mueller’s independence has been a gossip topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president via Paragraph 25.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, and there was a rumor that he was going to quit.
Instead, a meeting was arranged Thursday with Trump, who was at the time at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would “prefer not” to fire Rosenstein. But the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate Judiciary hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week’s FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate’s election.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no set date. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with everything going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I always like to keep the press updated.”
Some journalists wanted to challenge the claim: Sanders hasn’t held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences wasn’t due to TV journalists’ play for the gallery, but added, “I don’t disagree that they’re playing up to the camera.”
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president receives more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting a source: "We've looked at the numbers."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to give it ample opportunity, and you’ve seen us do it over the past few weeks, and it’s going to be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump often takes questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press conferences with high-ranking guests.
Press conferences with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made an impromptu and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the journalists present.
Health Minister contacting EU health officials in Scotland after Brexit concerns
The health minister has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish that they stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain resigned from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal are continuing and it appears that decisions are expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts made by each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work for the benefit of patients and the local community.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie Gets Emergency Surgery After Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Tennessee's Mike Organ.
First Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sidelines and just fell about out there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a stretcher and taking him in for further examination.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are "no details about the type or extent of the injury yet," and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when he sustained the injury.
Abercrombie is studying in her second year and is in her first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him 18 tackles overall this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK. The extra money, according to the Conservative Party, is supposed to help the homeless.
This move should dampen Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp duty will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it will raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp duty when buying properties in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and going after those with the highest incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will affect individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The earnings from this will be used for the government's struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp duty and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases to rent out, can reach 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects it can collect <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are bought by people living abroad, causing prices to rise and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying land they don’t use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap housing to solve Britain’s “shameful housing situation.”
Corbyn has proposed a conspicuous series of housing reforms, including the control of rent prices and the deprivation of the landlord’s ability to put people on the streets if they comply with the lease.
He also wants to strengthen the ability to build public housing.
May said: “Last year I said I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better with each generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be true that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as it is for hard-working Britons.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthiness of sleeping in the street is still far too widespread.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach"
Head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate goal" is at some point to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from North East, which now holds third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child, and that has always drawn in me.
However, that opportunity would only arise if I was successful in coaching clubs.”
Ross' predecessors coaching Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic said he had no hesitation in following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'm measuring success by whether 'I can get this club back in the Premier League.'
From the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I’ll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross is only three years into his career as a coach after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of the Hearts coaching team.
He then helped Alloa come back after being relegated to the third-best rank and transformed St Mirren from the relegation threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalls his time in Alloa.
“I honestly thought coaching was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I did well, served well and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are a lot of things you need to do on a weekly basis.
There’s still that kind of stress and pressure as a coach, but it just feels right.
I’ve always wanted to train, and now I do. I haven’t felt more comfortable with myself all my adult life.”

The heatwave this summer has increased earnings for England’s pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants have fallen by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long World Cup have meant July follows the pattern of June, where pubs experienced upsells of 2.8%, except that restaurants are harder hit now.
The drop of 1.8% in restaurants in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on the sale of beverages fared clearly best and experienced progress similar to the decline of the restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food suffered in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
Across pub and bar chains, beverage sales increased by 6.6% for the month, while food fell by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, who analyzes the service industry, said: “The results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
When it comes to selling on the out-of-home market, the weather and major social or sporting events are the biggest factors.
It’s no surprise that restaurants are still struggling, even though a drop in sales of 4.8% year after year will really hurt in addition to rising costs.
The long, hot summer couldn’t come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide a much needed respite.”
The total increase in sales overall for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, showing the decline in newly started brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales figures for the English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and they are a leader in the field.
One in five children have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a study.
A survey of 20,000 4th-9th grade school students reveals growth in “fake Insta” pages.
The news has increased fears that sexual content is being uploaded
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show their parents
One in five children as young as 11 years old creates accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from 4th grade onwards reveals massive growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to the Instagram photo sharing service.
The news has increased fears that sexual content is being uploaded.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show their parents, while they also have private ones.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools, found that 40% of 11-18 year olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s frightening that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most winning athleticist, and chairman Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to benefit from her vast 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great reputation in the athletic world of Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are confident that the athletics of Scotland will benefit from getting her on the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help outline a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and who is now often a commentator for the BBC, could not go after a transient ischaemic attack.
He tweeted, “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would get on top of it and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am completely healthy, have learned to walk again and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Advertising for breast pump comparing mothers to cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared the opinions online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump”, the technology consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement to showcase the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a stall filled with hay to a song that reads, among other things: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, this isn't the udder, it's my breasts."
The chorus reads, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bosom."
But the advertisement, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from viewers. Many say it makes fun of the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth,” one user wrote.

Another wrote: “Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added: "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the ad. One woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
"It's a great product," one wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump milk (often in their workplace or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bra.
The concept behind the advertisement is based on the fact that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no tubes or hoses and fits discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and CEO of Mother, wrote: “The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the challenges of breast pumping, while showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the freedom that the new pump can provide.”
This is not the first time that Elvie’s pump has made headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to tent camp on Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, although the number of border crossings has not changed, partly due to harsher rhetoric and the Trump administration’s tougher laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared for their ability to stay in the country by standing up and accepting a child.
The risk of repatriation increased in June when authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would provide fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that they had arrested several people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had clean criminal records.
“Nearly 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors’ households are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still chasing those people," Albence said.
In an attempt to process children’s cases faster, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention. Before that, it was within 60 days, humanitarian workers say.
Many people use video calls instead of appearing and advocating their legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those convicted of ineligibility for residence are quickly deported.
The longer children are in custody, the higher the likelihood that they will develop anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outcomes or attempts to escape, according to aid workers and in reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced at larger facilities like Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep an eye on whether a child is suffering.
They added that relocating to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria announces US, French and Turkish “occupying forces” to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the stay of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is “almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this decisive war until we have purged all Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and “illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
In the refugee field, Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unfounded fears" that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia against the province, where three million people live, was avoided.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists from the Nusra Front, a progenitor group of Al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of the new committee to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election. The committee consists of government and opposition members.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that the panel’s work should be limited to “reviewing the legislation in the current constitution,” and warned against interference.
Trump wins another presidential term
Under that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the impeachment and scandals end his presidency prematurely, as many liberal viewers hope.
In what will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!”
There are currently no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, top-time ratings have nearly doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million on nights of big news.
"It's a spectacle that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who heads the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a head of cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell said.
Chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike all other TV shows, the stories that come from Washington can determine the issue between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing channels is only the most privileged.
And yet it’s about more than being an enlightened citizen when you watch six hours of panel discussion where experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” when he wrote his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“clothed with hubris,” wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels’ vivid descriptions of Trump’s anatomy.
I will never watch Super Mario in the same way.
"One of the things that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of 'Pawn Stars,' about the Trump show's rotating crew and daily surprises (disputes with N.F.L, praise to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss an episode, you're off.
When I got hold of Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was shooting CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh to be heard in the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court to be decided.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums find their way to the close midterm elections to the House of Representatives
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money, and as a result of an equalization of two "Congressional Districts," two congressmen are fighting for the same seat.
This newly converted suburban district in Pittsburg is causing problems for Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another incumbent congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, overlapping heavily with the new 17th.
The cards were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district was unlawfully set up in favor of the Republicans.
The battle for the new 17th district has sparked a struggle for funding between the major party committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high-profile election in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been in Republican hands for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but changed its mind.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw Trump’s leadership team out.
State Department officials decided to recall senior US diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only El Salvador was punished; they received about $140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a summit on security and economic development, which should have continued last year's meeting, which was considered a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, thus dropping the consideration of punishments for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to send a signal about the importance that Americans attach to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys secretly went back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh demands or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the case, which had been described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who would like to talk about the internal deliberations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the basis of a condition of anonymity.
Know the story
The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of the investigation, for which there is substantial and publicly available evidence.
Mueller will also direct his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign secretly cooperated with Russia in the attack on the election.
If Congress should come into new hands, Trump is likely to be held accountable as he prepares to meet the electorate again and, eventually, a jury of his associates.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump’s end is inevitable – and so are his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
By 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years-long bloodbath thereafter.
It is around such turning points that the axis of history turns, and the irreversible march of democracy on or off.
The United States is now facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who determines the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since this newspaper announced that he had proposed last year to make covert footage of the president and challenged his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, the Times' presentation is inaccurate.
“How do we react if the FBI’s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly conducted – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, at the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the homeland of my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
How can I be anything but optimistic with that in my luggage?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the match against SK Rapid Wien
After the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, with a win against the Austrians, the Rangers will have good opportunities to move on from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his season debut before the 2–2 game against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went to the game with the belief that we could take something home and we got a point.
Maybe we could have taken the plug home, but overall it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last match, but with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of all the things that have happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys are really enjoying it.
Hopefully we can go on now, put the last season behind us and be successful.”
Anxiety over retirement savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey reported that they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“Most people would like a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do anything to initiate the conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationswide’s life insurance business.
This is how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them in good time about your wishes.
Use your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be decisive factors in the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed by means of a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have finances for it.
Get the legal documents in order: Take the legal battles in the run-up.
Get a power of attorney so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate yourself.
Also consider a financial mandate.
In that case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and ensure that your bills are paid if you are not able to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aging parents is in urgent need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing, so you're ready.
“It’s not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who takes care of the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a trip in the city.
The victim was in his 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, diaphragm and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m., as "totally accidental."
The victim did not see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are calling on witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, who expect the number of deaths to increase.
As the communication paths are out of play, relief workers have not been able to receive information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the cornerstones of the Central Sulawesi economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically located on the so-called fire ring in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, including over half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands out of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic as the people were reminded of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed by the crashing buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and for opposing arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is in custody in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bail without security, reports KTUU.
He was tried on Saturday, pleading "clearly not guilty," the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which could lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offence, which could lead to a one-day sentence in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is pending in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the report of a domestic violent crime, and possession of a weapon under the influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of slapping her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son’s violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, there are videos circulating showing the moment when the earthquake hits.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach party in the town of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
NYC prosecutors try to have terrorist suspect sentenced to rare death
Public prosecutors are trying to impose the death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people – a rare sentence that was last sentenced for a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were mowed down.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, as required by the letter of intent for the death penalty in New York's southern district.
According to the court document, the death penalty is a possible result of both charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury presented Saipov with a 22-point indictment, including eight allegations of murder in connection with gangster activity, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and an allegation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "extensive planning and preparations," the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "monstrous, vicious and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, bodily harm and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's Southern District last brought the defendant to trial for the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up in life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last imposed in a state trial in New York in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov was from Uzbekistan and, according to the judicial documents, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
Police said he told investigators he was comfortable with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, announced that they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecutors’ decision.
"We believe that the decision to go for the death penalty and not accept a confession and lifelong imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s lawyers had previously asked the prosecutors not to go for the death penalty.
Conservative minister believes NIGEL FARAGE should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative meeting today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must be able to “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May’s own ministers had stated that Farage should take over the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said Britain would have “been out now” if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May’s challenge to unite the deeply divided party is underscored by the fact that conservatives remain in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track under attack from both Brexiteers, retainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that, despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or “chaos.”
At the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Mr Farage should have been included and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out now," he said.
The minister from Wellingborough added, “I will fight for Brexit, but we must scrap the Chequers.”
On the background of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate to anyone.
We will make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected that public opinion should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their minds and would like to stay in the EU is completely wrong."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular with our own party and with our activists who are actually on the streets getting us elected.
Now stop chequers and start listening.'
As a pointed remark to May, she added, “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the parade that politicians should be able to "feel the pressure" if they fail the decision of the 2016 vote.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They will betray Brexit, but we are gathered to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “You have to make sure that the political class that is on the verge of betraying Brexit can feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, remainers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour parade in the city centre.
Dispersed activists waved Conservatives Against Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the security issues with the Conservative Party app before the meeting.
"These are the people who claim to be in control of the IT systems and technology for Canada, for border controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"It's ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is 'strongly considering' running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren is “strongly considering running for president” after the mid-term elections in November.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a council meeting last Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, will seek re-election in November against state Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been questioned whether she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters at City Hall since Trump took office.
A contestant asked her if she plans to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front.”
Arrest in LSU's Sims shooting case
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced the arrest of a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting to ask for help identifying a man on the footage.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died from the injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being present, possessing a weapon, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a problem and is now in East Baton Rouge District police custody.
Sims was a two-metre-high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season, he played 32 games, started in ten and played an average of 17.4 minutes, making 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to World Cup after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team’s orders would play a decisive role in the race.
From the lead position Bottas got off to a good start and was close to detaching Hamilton completely as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in the pit as the first, leaving Hamilton to struggle with the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went into the pit a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back ahead when after some wheel contact the Ferrari driver reluctantly had to leave the inner court after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race when, in an attempt to quickly finish, he failed to change tires to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to go in the pit in the 44th lap, but could not increase the pace in the last eight laps, so Raikkonen secured fourth place.
"It's a tough day because Valtteri did great all weekend and was really a gentleman when he let me pass.
The team did an incredible job to secure both first and second place," Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a poll on Saturday for insisting she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sex abuse.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not explicitly mention the testimony that Ford had given before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that events in the Senate showed that people were "evil and disgusting and dishonest."
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the wrath, when you see people who are angry and vicious and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember her answer... Was it you who leaked the document – “uh, uh, what?
No, no, no, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hey, wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked anything," he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter about Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't concealed Dr. Ford's allegations, and I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said at Saturday’s poll: “I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
During the president’s continued defense of the nominated judge to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, Trump suggested that Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own case.
“They do not shy away from any means in their efforts to regain power.
You can see the viciousness, the disgust, they don’t care who they’re going to drum to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made amends after Friday’s losing Elite League match against the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants quickly came ahead with two goals of attack from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised at home before Dwyer again brought the Giants ahead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the season's third Elite League defeat for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's game in Belfast.
It was the fourth side-to-side meeting of the season in which the Giants emerged victorious in the previous three games.
Dwyer started in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as an assist, as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got ahead at the first break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard equalised again with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their five games, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller killed to ensure hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers came down safely to the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake on Friday struck Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks still ravage the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for his life, he refused to leave his seat in the swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed back in his seat to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway, was safely launched.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are devastated,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll may reach several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness team announces that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins and it is not possible to reach them," spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which is holding a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly relief and supplies in.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance arrives with several bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the shops are plundered."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to come up with.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the clock to carry out all tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he said, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombrok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says man is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says a man is missing, although it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said it could not locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to find the man.
The airline has not returned to request more information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very shallow water.
"That was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could go in water to life to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and shouted, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to renovate a quay nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analyst Determines Timeline for the Night a Woman Was Burned Alive
The prosecutor's office closed its evidence on Saturday during the appeal for a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telecommunication information to summarize the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several different mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time when he had alleged that he was visiting Sanford with his friend Michael Sanford, police said.
Sanford sat down at the witness counter on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to deliberate later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hiphop trio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to get back to the starting point and make political hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in the UK due to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York's Nanny Sues Couple After Firing With 'Racial' Text Message
A nanny in New York sued a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a mistaken text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEJ, NOT YET A BLACK PERSON," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice, saying that their former nanny, as from African-American, had been poor at her job and that instead she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one-day work and sent home in an Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the firing and compensation for $350 a day during the six months she should have lived with the family, even though this was agreed without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't afford to do something like that," she told the newspaper Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something that she would not have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion" and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you really going after someone that way?
That is not very kindly done,” the investment adviser added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the People’s Court has already dismissed the couple on social media and shamed their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the one to read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun to read now that you know how popular Paddington became.”
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little clothes teddy bear, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bitterly sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father was in all modesty proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to boast," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who achieved something: you’re proud of them, even if it’s not really your fault.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity a little bit like that.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington’s fault.”
She said goodbye to her daughter over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called on a regular basis to say it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die in the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you later.
The medication she had been given to keep her heart moving slowly lost its effect.
She had died shortly before, and now her body shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to pull myself together.”
Eventually, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers who had no idea what she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
“I bowed my head and tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women trying to stop suicide jumpers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed maps on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers for help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I'm going through every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
His smile was known to everyone.
“People said his smile brightened the room.”
However, he stopped working before he died because he felt really bad.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found him after he took his own life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid of it spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don’t go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Sharon Davis' longtime friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her fifteen-year-old boyfriend, Mark, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say anything about being upset or depressed or anything,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas, he started to change.
When the children opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: “It has created a hole in our family.
It has torn us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future remains unclear as FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a limited-term investigation with limited scope – maybe we could get a bit of agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee “falled from the hind” in the midst of the stalemate.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct their investigation?
Their restraint is due to timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if Republicans, as expected, do poorly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have elected to the country's highest judgeship.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through that met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors 'fall' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislature.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from South Korea’s Ministry of Mergers and said there were 1,127 defectors last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park noted that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human traffickers were contributing to the changed numbers.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea will eventually be offered citizenship in South Korea.
South Korea says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most are fleeing via China, which has the longest border adjacent to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China sees the defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often repatriated.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to talk about the stranded nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This follows the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea at an overall level.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will disarm on our own," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh 'Hysterical' and Says He's Unfit for Supreme Court
Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for Supreme Court justice, "hysterical" and said his temperament was unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called hysterical," Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his high school years, he almost shouted and was crying.
He also denounced the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and a coordinated character bravery" organised by the left, who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s statement proved he could not sit on the Supreme Court because it showed he is biased towards the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi shrugged when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
“I would say that if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not fit to sit on the Supreme Court, but certainly in the court he’s sitting on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington, D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions in relation to Obama’s health care reform or the Roe v. Wade abortion case because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, biased person has to contest a job as a judge and expects us to say 'well, it's not just great,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It’s a fair outcome, months and years of anger that is overwhelming, and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual. Do you think?"
She continued, “I got great support from a woman who was the boss, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sorry because I’m crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with a predominance of men, where I often cried with anger, where I was caught by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss who I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry," she said to me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad they got you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Democratic Congress, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be having an affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she might as well run for president herself.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said laughing at me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the run-up, and they certainly didn’t need another candidate.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she promised she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
“Do you think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she gave a speech about her refusal to run, she was overwhelmed by feelings—gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach out to voters instead of electors, and anger at sexism—that she got a lump in the throat.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
“You’d think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How the trade war between the US and China could benefit Beijing
The opening talks in the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and although the battle is far from over, discord between the countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week with new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing has always retaliated, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5-10% on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to follow the US all the way, and the world’s second largest economy probably won’t give in just for now.
If it causes Washington to withdraw its demands, it means they are yielding, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the US pressure in the trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing could breed an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than thought," said Abigail Grace, research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is 'ready' to accept refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the refugees to return and asks for help in rebuilding the country, which has been devastated by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All conditions are now in place for the refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011, when the war began.
A further six million people still in the country are in need of emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government was happy to accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that helped support the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the American team 16.5–10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time for most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on par 3 on hole 16, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari did well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have scored 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament's current format started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
No. 1 in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the baggage, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It's a team effort and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the torch on to his compatriot John Ram, who felled American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It’s a weird statistic for one of the best golfers ever to win 14 major titles, surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble forming throughout the weekend with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing show: "I'm proud of the guys because they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we opposed Europe.
We lost.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we will move on.
I love the 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lift your hat.
We were defeated.”
Update on algae bloom: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decline in algae concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, there are reports of scattered blooms in the area around Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – suggesting that the concentration is decreasing.
The bloom of algae spreads over a coastline of 210 km from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
There are minor blooms about 16 km from the coast in Hillsborough County, but there are fewer than last week.
There have also been blooms in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations in or at sea have been reported in Pinellas County over the past week, low to high concentrations in the sea off Hillsborough County, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee County, background concentrations to high concentrations in or at sea off Sarasota County, background concentrations to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background concentrations to high concentrations in or at sea off Lee County, and low concentrations in Colliers County.
There are still reports of breathing difficulties in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of respiratory distress in Northwest Florida in the past week.
