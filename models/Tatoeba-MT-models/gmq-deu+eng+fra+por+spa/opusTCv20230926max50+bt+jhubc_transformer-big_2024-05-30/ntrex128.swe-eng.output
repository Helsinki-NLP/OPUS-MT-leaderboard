AM in Wales is worried about "looking like a fool"
Some AMs, members of the National Assembly of Wales, are confused over a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes after plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Across the political spectrum, AM is worried about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who do not speak Welsh: Twp means dumb in Welsh and pwp means poop.
An AM for Plaid said the group was generally “dissatisfied” and has suggested other options.
A conservative Welshman said his group is “open” to the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from the MWP to the Mupp.
In this context, W is pronounced in Welsh like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently compiling legislation for the name change, said: “The final decision for what members of the Assembly should be called is so clearly up to the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly the Parliament of Wales.
Regarding the title of AM, the Commission proposed Welsh Parliament Members or WMP, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
AM apparently suggests other options, but problems with reaching a consensus could cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the change within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules for the disqualification of an AM and the design of the comitology system.
They are allowed to vote on what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonia holds referendum on name change
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the neighbouring country’s name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly protested its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the name change and has said that he will ignore the result.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's silence when churches in Harlem run into trouble
"Older people I talk to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," Mr. Adams said.
"Now there is neither."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
“People are interacting differently these days,” he said.
“Bars aren’t like the area’s living room anymore, where people go on a regular basis.”
Regarding the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not go as far as the leaders expect and that "sooner or later they will end up in the limelight again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with owner-occupied apartments filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all the churches, because those who move into the apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, that refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was severely damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's congregation planned the renovation, they also built the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson’s son and successor at St. Martin’s, proudly called the music game “the clocks of the poor.”
The expert who played the bell game in July had another name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first bell game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the larger bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the past few months at St. Martin’s are a complicated story with architects and contractors – some hired by the church’s lay, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church assembly – the governing body of the church consisting of laymen – wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would "try to pass the cost" to the church assembly, even though the church assembly had not been involved when the diocese hired architects and contractors.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old who dives for lobster in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving after lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place just before seven o'clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he thought the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized the boy was screaming, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that his entire clavicle had been torn.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water. 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel told me.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition was reported to be critical.
It is unclear which shark it was.
Lifeguard captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles also said the victim suffered trauma injuries to his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's enters UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-like beauty halls with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow despite the fall in the fashion and household market, the larger beauty halls will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket’s attempts to fill the shelves that used to be taken up by television sets, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury’s said it plans to double its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space with highlighted areas, such as in stores like Boots.
The retail chain is also relaunching its boutique makeup brand so that most of the products are vegan – which more and more young customers demand.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test stands in two Sainsbury's stores - the first stand opened in Croydon, South London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy smaller amounts of food every day in local stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, has said their stores will look increasingly like department stores in an effort to fight off cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stands in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which according to them has increased food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempts to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how the proceeds from Boots' sales in supermarkets would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have given our beauty halls a new look and a new feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need, and with an appealing environment in agile locations, we are now an alluring beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'Raged' After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is "enraged" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby is pulling out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their Truly brand, with casual wear and accessories.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragons Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “enraged” at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new deal – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she no longer had time to focus on their Truly brand of casual wear and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her vacation homes.
One source said: "Truly was definitely Holly's number one priority.
That would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to pull out shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that This Morning presenter’s decision to withdraw could cost the company several million dollars due to significant investments in everything from pillows and candles to clothing and the risk of further delays in launch.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role of chairman in March.
The couple are vacationing together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Tough talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked that the mass media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider “unworthy of a president” and for being so positive about North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a "news anchor voice":
“I haven’t given up on anything.”
He said Kim wants a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "corresponding response" from the United States after North Korea's first disarmament steps.
He noted that the US instead continues sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his supporters.
“North Korea is doing great,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results – an end to missile tests, freed hostages and returned the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d have around 200 people here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate Indonesian island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had lost their homes, a state of emergency was not declared, which is required for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international help, which complicates the whole thing," Ms Sumbung said.
Save the Children is gathering a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear if foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, the Natural Disaster Agency spokesman, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international organizations should be allowed to participate in aid efforts.
Given Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning having been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even in perfect conditions, travelling between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days for it to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and railroads.
But inadequate funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's election.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge wins last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a 89th-minute goal at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was 1-0 behind.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the far post.
The attempt flew high over the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga’s jump and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get in a position to get to the ball and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approach and didn’t think about it much, just kicked.”
Chelsea led 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker poured a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spinned off near midfield and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at midfield.
Then he got a superb kick that brought Hazard into the goal area.
Hazard ran away from the defence and got the ball into the net at the far post with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea face off against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were reported to have been trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 quake that struck last Friday, triggering waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was full of debris from buildings that had fallen.
Police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A spokesman for the police has confirmed that the woman who was found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but police said no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She says "it's so terrible" over and over again.
At 14:00 there were two police cars inside the barrier and another just outside.
A number of police officers stood inside the barrier with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament statue of Cromwell latest victim of quarrel over rewriting of history
An excommunication would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "foolishness" and "try to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be drawn into the ongoing debate about removing statues.”
The Iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
The wrong Cromwell might have been sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the 19th-century view of and is part of the historiography of a man that many still believe should be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against outside pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
Whether this is a correct representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict of the mid-17th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Pig kills farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, who is identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a stall at the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccine into pigs in a pig stall on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a pig stall nearby was open.
He said there was a big pigtail in the pigsty with blood on its mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted," the cousin identified with the surname Wu told the Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to avoid further attacks while police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reported to be negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare for pigs to attack humans, but it has happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 300 kilos stuck a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “catalyst.”
“They’re just playful.
They're peeping, they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anybody.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rain to the southwest
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it travels over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind speed of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to head north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture northwards into the southwestern United States.
Pink will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching trough will create extensive heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5–10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, mud flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwestern United States, especially in much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rains.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone heads out into the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into rushing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The approaching trough brings some local heavy rain to parts of southern California’s coastline.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to mud flows and slippery roads.
It would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rains become more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October may mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is a nearly ten degree difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October with around 30 degrees from the Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York could get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be around five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s interrogation
Over 20 million watched Thursday’s arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued and normal broadcasting was interrupted for Friday’s last-minute twist – Arizona Senator Jeff Flake’s deal with the FBI giving them a week to investigate the allegation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely sure that Kavanaugh tapped her when he was drunk trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he is absolutely sure that it did not happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks showing the interrogation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people watching from the office.
In comparison, there are as many viewers as for a football match in the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had the most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long interrogation, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the second most with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the interview.
Flake was the focus of Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protesters screaming at him as he attempted to take an elevator to a hearing with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down at the floor for several minutes as the protesters shouted at him, which was shown live by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The television networks broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to pass on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee in the coming week, as the minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision had a major impact, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political games' around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political games” about Britain’s future and undermining the nation’s interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s tariffs was “completely unreasonable.”
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for murder, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between the Sims and Simpson and police said the Sims dropped their glasses in the battle.
Police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted he shot Wayde to death.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner released a preliminary report last Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and into the neck.
The police thanked the Louisiana State Police's escape force, the police's state forensics lab, Southern University police and residents of the area for assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-metre-long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crushed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about this all the time," Wade said.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and they recorded 183 spills of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center detected several mullets and quakes.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash on windshields in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano that stands 72 km southeast of the capital since a 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with riot police while thousands took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by riot police threw eggs and paint powder at them, leading to dark dust clouds on streets usually full of tourists.
Fights also broke out later in the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For hours the independence groups shouted “never forget, never forgive” while the unionists shouted “long live Spain”.
14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local press.
The atmosphere is still tense in the region, which yearns for independence one year after the referendum on October 1, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted for independence, but participation was low as most opposed to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
Electrician Narcis Termes, 68, took part in the separatist protest with his wife, saying he no longer believes that Catalonia will become independent.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy to be able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties in favour of independence have found it difficult to keep up the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or are in custody pending trial on their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on her mobile, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidating to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car crashes into house
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after a car was repeatedly driven into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST last Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car.
Menga wins Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston shocked the Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt’s side was split second with Hibernian.
Gerrard’s side have still not won a Premiership this season and will face Hearts, with eight more points, next Sunday.
In the meantime, the Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna to the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning distance to six games – head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses out on chances against hefty visitors
Holt’s team should have taken the lead long before they scored; their straightforwardness gave the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after slipping in to measure Craig Halkett's nod across the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could attack in certain games.
That’s how the decisive goal was achieved.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to give Menga a chance, who scored from the middle of the goal area.
At that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team's defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was left largely alone.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot widely from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings constantly entered Livingston’s target area and were handled smoothly. Two penalties – following Halkett’s challenge by exchanger Glenn Middleton and one at hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have barely changed since returning to the upper level, but Holt deserves the credit for galvanizing the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a cleverly organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in full range.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They’ve had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn’t live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn’t hold up – they only opened the home page once – and it’s something of an alarm clock for the Rangers, which is in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday offered smiles and blue sky (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – to repair relations between NATO allies.
They have become uneasy over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police claimed they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdish – also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dueling protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and condemned as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The hook took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in southeast London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and a paramedic was called there, but the man died on the spot.
The crash takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and notify his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked off and buses have been diverted and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in turmoil
Six prison guards have been injured in unrest at a men's high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
The unrest broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado guards" have been called there to deal with the unrest, involving eight prisoners on a grand piano.
The guards were treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff have been sent there to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind it will be attributed to the police and may face increased prison sentences.”
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to the prison to deal with serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Pink Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flood (Areas of Drought May Benefit)
It is rare for tropical lows to reach Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy sweeps across the desert in the southwestern United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to fly directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, bringing rain late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the Arizona border.
The National Hurricane Center’s latest models predict 5–10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 2.5–5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably be beneficial because the southwestern United States is suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will first cross the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum wind strength of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north at 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico's landmass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can receive heavy rain, which poses a considerable risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5–15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The biggest danger from Rosa and its residual energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert in the southwestern United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and mud flows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to the phone to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered, the meanness, the anger" from the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the recklessness and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump told his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered from the meanness, anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before Congress about his accusation.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliance and the quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to affirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to affirm one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m running,” he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats were trying to “resist and hinder.”
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number rises
At least 384 people died, many were swept away as gigantic waves crashed against the shores, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu last Friday when up to six-meter-high waves crashed against the beach at dusk, sweeping out many to a certain death, destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami came after an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of immediately running away, and they fell victim to the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster agency BNPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone, it dragged cars, logs and houses. It hit everything in its path," said Nugroho. He also said that the tsunami had travelled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are twisted and have collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the massive earthquake last Friday was 200 times as large as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "widespread" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found beneath the debris of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area known as Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
The communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had struck Palu, but authorities said the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man upstairs in a building is heard screaming frenetic warnings about the tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes against the shore and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a massive power outage that cut off all communications around Palu, making rescue work more difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun sending cargo flights with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but evacuated people are still in dire need of food and other supplies.
The city’s airport has been opened for relief work and will remain closed to other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from a tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from World Vision in Donggala have made their way to Palu where they seek shelter under tarpaulins in the yard outside the office, but they saw devastation along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of ruined houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have begun to work hard, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only be used if a state of emergency is declared after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
“It’s still a regional disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the authorities say it’s a national disaster, we can let in international aid, but that status hasn’t been announced yet.”
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing people were still hoping that their loved ones would turn out to be the miracles that light up grim natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was rescued from a sewer.
Last Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia’s national paragliding team coach, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a paragliding veteran, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that hours after the paragliders heard that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who attended the beach festival.
But his messages got only one grey tick, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling up an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The car's driver had emptied an ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the message.
While he was busy, "another man jumped up behind the Brink's co-worker" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the press release, but police did not say how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on the identity of the perpetrators should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, saying, “The creature formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the program, which was cancelled for "emotional reasons" according to the creators of the program.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the word most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year as he talked about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, meaning ‘the one’, to just Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without hyphens and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use the military against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador vowed at Tlatelolco Plaza to “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Troops fired weapons at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly grants for students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double AI Funding
Now that China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, according to inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an overall formal AI strategy.
China announced its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
A double budget could double the chance of the next major AI breakthrough being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC earlier this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later served in the leadership of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google’s China department.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next step would be to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking the academic leaders away from us, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said new immigration policies could also help the U.S. with the AI innovation.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to graduate students in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides grants to individuals at academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies distributing money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
U.S. legislation that would create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence hasn’t made any progress in months.
Macedonia referendum on name change
Macedonia's population voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia," which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has hindered the country's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, claiming that the name of its northern neighbour is a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change would undermine Macedonia’s Slavic majority identity.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the minimum participation rate of 50% required for the referendum to be valid will be reached.
The question on the ballot paper in the referendum is: "Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
But supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth changing the name if it allows Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia split, to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for the youth of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome for it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority of the parliament.
According to the state election commission, no irregularities had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the referendum in Macedonia on the country’s name change, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, arranged a small stage and place out chairs in front of the tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our heads in the air, not sneak in through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO would lead to much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
“I think the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Survey, between 30 and 43 percent of voters were planning to vote in the referendum, which falls below the minimum participation required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of participants were planning to vote on Sunday.
70% of them voted yes.
For the referendum to be counted, 50% of registered voters plus one vote must be counted.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback to the Western-oriented government’s policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero makes his way through Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton’s suggestion in Manchester City’s 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass from the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and set out on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He made his way around a defender and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's goal area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling on the left.
The English forward used his first kick in the goal area to give back the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial edge in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep into Brighton's territory on that game.
He sent off a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net the moment before it ended up out of reach.
City face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies
The Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competitive Scherzer wants to pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, still have a chance at the playoffs.
The Rockies got a wild card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking for their first division title.
"We play for nothing, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber knowing the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and that the other team would play at a higher level than any other team I would face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to be there?”
The Nationals have not announced their starter for Sunday yet, but according to reports, they are inclined to let Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who was to make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day.
Washington’s right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Speaks in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones... I’m not running, but I’m running. That’s why I’m going around fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see a terrible, awful group of radical Democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their meanness, awfulness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We're not going to let them have it."
Democrats, he said, are struggling to “resist and hinder.”
"You've seen that in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and nasty and terrible and false."
He mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was met by loud booming from the crowd.
“Do you remember what she said?
“Did you read the document?”
'Uh, uh, huh?
No, no, I'm expecting a...' That was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don’t tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs to hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe – ironically similar topics that Jeremy criticized former leaders for.
The announcement of the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday said: “We want the meetings to be welcoming and productive.”
For most of my eight years as Labour’s local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of “kinder, gentler” politics has been forgotten long ago, if it ever even began.
It has become increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated within Labour, and any opinion is judged by whether the party’s leader accepts it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues whom I previously thought had a similar political outlook as I expected me to make a complete turnaround and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was national security or the EU’s internal market.
Every time I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – a tide of mischief follows on social media that demands that I be ousted, criticizes my politics and says I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this isn't just affecting me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed against me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues as they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era's policies is the level of insults that is now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality we are no longer this broad church, and with every motion of censure and every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes ever narrower.
I’ve been given a lot of advice in the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straightforward, so “it’ll be okay.”
But that’s not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a schoolboy 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher’s government’s neglect that literally made my primary school classroom collapse, I’ve been trying to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at the local level and as a minister of government.
I have never concealed my political views, and that includes the last election.
No one in Nottingham East may in any way have been confused by my views on policies and topics where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those of you who promoted the petition on Friday, I just want to say that as the country moves toward a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I don’t understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of dismissal or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unbeaten Ayr on top
Two last-minute attempts may have slightly distorted the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this delightfully entertaining Tennent’s Premiership match.
They are now at the top, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our matches so far and are still unbeaten, so we are obviously happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, which was converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, who was let in by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's lead by a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17–5 in the break.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a long wait after a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off the pitch, and after the restart Ayr increased the lead again with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Clima.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Clima without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty-line-out behind Ayrs Maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent away flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game Star Seems Ready for New Career in Restaurant Industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to head into the restaurant business after it is discovered that he has been named CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to venture into Glasgow's "blooming restaurant industry".
"The sea belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes the court opens the way to the Pacific again
Sailors patrol a rigged naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to restore it.”
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong – as is the longing to sail the Pacific once again.
This hope is higher than in decades now that Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has a drive, an atmosphere of unity and peace, and of course awaits the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia’s demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them their own outlet to the sea.
Monday’s decision is also of great importance to Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts find it incredible that the court judges in favor of Bolivia, and that not much would change even if it does.
The UN Court, based in the Netherlands, is not entitled to assign Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision was announced only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have rather hurt than promoted Bolivia’s chances.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She argues that Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has tarnished Chile’s remaining benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not consider that the Court's decision had been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an unprecedented opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific,” he said.
“The decision is a chance to realize that we must move on from the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Requires Trust in the US
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said the nation would not disarm its nuclear weapons until they can’t trust Washington.
Ri addressed the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resolving the impasse on nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "wisdom" that continued sanctions and US protests against a statement that ending the Korean War will ever tame North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first launching significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to dispose of an arsenal that it probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal Latest Line of Huge Headwear on the Way to Shops Near You
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a range of weird, oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk that dazzled the style icons of Paris Fashion Week.
Incredibly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent off their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s main creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a feather-like wide hat border that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple – but they’re not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful worms had sewn together lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creature looked like a wetsuit with a snorkel and a dive mask, and another looked like a melted glass ostrich.
And if you continue that tremendous bravery, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hoods may be heading to stores near you.
The oversized hats come shortly after La Bomba – the straw hat with a 60 cm brim that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out yet another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that held it.
The terracotta raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer – the designer has had such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills Essential for Global Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools maintain outstanding academic achievements and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding exam results, which are only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sports, arts, music and other community engagements.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement customized curriculums, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and in demand topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with the highest number of approved scores in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received an A in the Higher Grade final exam.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students studying Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French, and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subject choices are now considered as important as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics on curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that employers found it difficult for various reasons to fill their vacancies, with 17% attributed to a lack of language skills.
Having said that, language skills are becoming all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of their career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult Britons published by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent said they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and with French being the only language that totaled a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is so important to invest in language teaching for our children.
Being able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding a meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and bring them the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly language that continues to be decisive for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
The number of minutes he plays has not yet been determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' preseason schedule.
“I don’t need preseason play at this stage of my career to get ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is making his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five scheduled appearances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmatory vote of his candidate for the Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to build support for upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress ahead of the upcoming November elections.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled for 7 p.m., tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to tackle this week’s interrogation of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense after allegations of his sexual assault, with an expected delay in the Senate’s vote of up to a week while the FBI’s investigation into the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help Republicans get some meat on their feet for the November elections.
President Trump said that these five gatherings next week aim to “engage volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the hectic campaign period," a Trump campaign spokesman said.
The night's event, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw in fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has lagged behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come there to try to give him an increase in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep hopes alive for Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's party competitions could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The moment’s swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before, for competitions like these.
So what momentum is it about now?
“They had a six-point lead and now it’s four, so we’re carrying it as a little momentum I guess,” Spieth said.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points advance with twelve more to be won.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have a little wind in their sails, but they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, combing three points out of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets an example.
The wins were even higher as his round continued and he lowered a decisive putt to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had lagged behind with two after two games.
His putt who won them the game at 15 was met with a similar roar, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players have left now.
18 holes to win.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup's undeniable story.
Europe's odd but adorable couple is four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't do a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and the crowd’s reactions state that they are the players to beat on Sunday and there is no more popular player who could comb a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on front nine sunk the Spaniard and Swede into a hole they never even came close to crawling out of.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a significant lead for the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a fighting spirit that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong edge on the Ryder Cup’s last day after coming out of Saturday’s four-ball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really got started during this morning's four-ball 3-1.
The U.S. offered more opposition in the foursome and won two games, but that was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyks team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari, named "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in four-ball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5 & 4.
Woods, who broke through two games on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and foursome, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during this morning’s four-ball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes for a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – ranked first and third in the world.
Europe didn’t have tailwind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They came home with a 2 & 1 win over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point disadvantage in the singles matches, however, Furyk's side only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
After being second best for two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday could be difficult to get through.
North Korea says it will "never" disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their mistrust of the United States and it was not possible for the country to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that over the past year, North Korea had taken “significant steps to show its goodwill,” such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no chance that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a nuclear-related approach that would result in North Korea being rewarded for taking gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution altogether as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work towards “denuclearization on the Korean peninsula” while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also declined negotiations to ease harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘decommissioning first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose through coercion and even objects to the ‘declaration to end the war’,” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a dream come true for those people who lack knowledge about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leaders highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party on this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a stalemate.”
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s future ability to reach the US mainland by rockets was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocketman” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take measures for disarmament, but it said that much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeframe for this, saying "whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and unfailingly until we realize a complete, final, verified disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him a few hours later of making "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear power complex if the United States took “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moving toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Course on Getting Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has prompted all graduate students to improve their sleep habits in an effort to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeinated “days.”
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often clueless about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why don't I know this until now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organized for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course includes a range of interactive tasks.
Part of the course includes a picture of a dorm, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior directly.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as one has the right to know about the health benefits of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in being “adult” still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in a state of starvation and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has taken one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar program of study before they begin their studies at the high-performing department.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn around the clock, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal lowers Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to take home their first win on the road since February’s 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team delivered Gerrard’s second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers never evened out the result.
While the Rangers now fall down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind the Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be more problems on the pitch for the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point off Hearts last week and he would have been delighted with the way his well-oiled game outshone opponents every time.
The Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
There should have been a goal already two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass let through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then reached team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear pole.
The Rangers took control of the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game during the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo probably felt he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian’s call.
The Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily took Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livi’s opening shot at the 34th minute may have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their knockout deserved it.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's firm situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch gave almost immediate effect when the outsider hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get opponents to play exactly the kind of games they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up the long pass after the long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened his lead in the final stage, but McGregor managed to stop Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside after the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had yet another late penalty claim when battling Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger meter.
Geiger meters have become a cornerstone of science since then and also figure largely in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring in the seemingly improbable cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
“What the hell is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to 'See' Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to 'See' Cancer Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many cancers and then be re-injected
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers,” explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, following his SNL appearance.
It didn't go so well
Kanye West was booed out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a swaggering performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town in which he wore a Make America Great cap, he rallied against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago.
SNL started the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee about the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the playback of West's presentation was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to mess with West with the post.
West had also complained in front of the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headgear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I dropped low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Would you like to sink low too?" and said he would "put my supermancap on, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments attracted more burops at least twice from the audience and co-workers from SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. One person said, "There was a deadlock in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West baffled many with his performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the head of conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR THAT YOU BELIEVED YOU AGAINST THE MOB.”
But the talk show host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was herself and it's absolutely wonderful."
But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his “art”) who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rap legend, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The allegations will be investigated by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington hits toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken out negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "pretty strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel pretty strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He continued, “What is native and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it’s really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the show, so that way it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, health authorities say.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV transmission through intercourse is an urgent issue in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will sooner or later marry women.
Many of the cases of infection are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
The Chinese government has been promising universal access to HIV medicine since 2003 as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaked GOP senator's data, covering up "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. congressman Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday allegations that one of her employees posted personal data on three Republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these allegations were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
"Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released the information about a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“My staff — whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims — were in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’s statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They must not question the questioner's motives.
They need to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to be trying to compare Water’s reaction with the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of appearing angry during Thursday’s interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to oust Waters in the middle of his term, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned “appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all of their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all of my employees."
Johnny English Strikes Again - Powerless Spy Parody by Rowan Atkinson
It’s now tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new film with British slope, and the same seems to apply to this remake of the latest Johnny English action comedy – a series of spy parodies that kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and gained new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sharp satire about how obviously bad we are become the nation’s new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has his license to crap to sake renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide comic creation intended for cinema audiences even in non-English speaking countries
Of course, he’s the weird secret agent, who despite his bizarre claims of smoothie glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the 2012 Olympics in London.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that wreak havoc wherever he goes.
There are one or two great moments in the latest JE movie
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy appears, but the humor feels rather low-key and strangely redundant, especially since the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's adapted for children rather than adults and to me Johnny English's weird pranks aren't as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film brawls in the role of Bean.
The constant topic now is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain's agents out in the field, to the agent in the service's great dissatisfaction - an incredibly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-working figure, already suffering a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script offers little to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that when every single active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the stammering Johnny English in person, now employed as a teacher in some wealthy institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former long-standing sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly-hockey-sticks-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong at Her Majesty's Secret Service and encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain’s computer trouble: the unhappy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farcical pranks: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they wreak havoc as they smuggle aboard Volta’s luxury yacht; and English unleashes sheer anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to get acquainted with the inside of Volta’s house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and fast-paced, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderate as a whole.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help thinking: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies drafting a plan for British workers to work a four-day week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party is considering a radical plan that British workers work a four-day week – but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to hand over savings made through the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend — but keep the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would “match” with the party’s economic agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labor official told The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It will not happen in a day, but a four-day working week is an endeavor that fits into the Party’s attitude to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the Party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the Greens who promised a four-day working week during their 2017 election campaign.
However, this objective is not endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not the party’s policy and it is nothing on which the party agrees.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless leaders” and “parasites” at government companies.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get back all their efforts, as a Labour government can make “deductions” because of what they perceive to have been wrong actions.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10 percent of the private company's equity is handed over to its employees, who are then expected to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on “60 Minutes” reveal whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their views.
The FBI’s investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency’s investigations could cause any Republican senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could disclose anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, and said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, convinced, unambiguous."
However, Graham's voice seems unshakable.
“I’ve already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she names couldn't verify it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features a hugely impressive lineup of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; to fight world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people pilgrimage to Central Park’s Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival is, according to a 2012 statement, an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you weren’t ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling, or in other meaningful ways helping to raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called “clicktivism” – people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “documents” from its supporters who have fought for a variety of goals.
It states that these measures have helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and actors committed to “helping children develop to their full potential,” promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can turn social injustice like malnutrition into a footnote in history,” Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken requiring the UK to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which includes dietary programs targeting 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on his website: “What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responded, “It’s going to be a long and difficult road – sometimes we’ll fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use its fleet in a "blockade" to prevent Russian energy exports, says interior minister
The government can "when necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy players from entering markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where it seems at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think they’re in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the sea routes are kept open and, if necessary, apply blockade, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are indeed the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day sledgehog" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
Statements come after the Trump administration has aimed to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington’s opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was backfired by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the US to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly disapprove of a third party disrupting our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a “proper think” if she’s going to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "proper think" about her participation in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will consider seriously running for president.”
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he “took this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own supporters did not believe she would be running for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator shouldn’t be running, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in regards to a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday evening.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through now that he’s back, I can relate to other families who have experience with PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers are returning with,” she said.
Palin called his arrest the "elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back like other people, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and aviators, and all other members of the military, have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempted obstruction of a report of domestic violence and gun possession intoxicated, according to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 states, as well as the District of Columbia support the questioning of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal process aimed at a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filed a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members' sons" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy changed a 2014 immigration decision that allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed based on specific facts and circumstances to which the claim relates, and such a provision violates that principle,” according to the friend-of-the-court report.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies that deny the entry of immigrants harm the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “delivery the necessary manpower.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said when the policy was announced on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems — even all the serious problems — that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu as death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked increasingly bleak.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance is picking up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is scarce.”
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rooting through water-damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, injured in the 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftershocks.
With tearful eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to escape.
I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper about the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily paying an addition to the Des Moines Register - the state's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the U.S. 6th congressional election, which China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in US elections marked what US officials told Reuters is a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with higher tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa who support Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now doubling bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government uses America’s cherished tradition of free speech and a free press to spread propaganda by publishing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the newsstand on the street here in Beijing, you will find a limited number of dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the diverse views that the Chinese people may have on China’s troubled economy, because the media is controlled with iron hand by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female voters ahead of midterm elections through Kavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
As many top Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh who faces multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a setback, especially from women, during the upcoming elections.
Feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
You can't turn back the clock," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes’ (R-Arizona) final attempt at an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate building when Republicans who control the court committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go up the ceiling," Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already been loud, it’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among still undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony with allegations of sexual assault against the nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested a setback could follow if Republicans pushed through the affirmation.
“This has become a confused mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets through, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic election campaigns.
But Americans in general seem to be divided over who to believe in in the wake of Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe in the most.
A recent YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents definitively or most likely believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitively or most likely believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as those made by at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that that candidate for the Supreme Court exposed her genitals to her while attending a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is that the company should bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers working on the project, and a team of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren’t talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are put on the rise overnight.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruptt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Also during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era on the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Won: Priest awarded with Victoria Cross during World War I celebrated
The only priest in the Church of England to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his actions during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the British military's most prestigious award.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the line of fire and led the line forward with "great bravery" before alone deciding the battle.
Lt. Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something that I know I could never live up to, but something that I am very humbled by."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feel very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you’ve stopped all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main event.
The show from San Jose featured 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the show suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were unimpressed after staying awake in the early hours of the morning to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the change to a children’s cartoon program as “a sick joke.”
“It was the government’s decision that the content wasn’t appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the broadcast.
"Greta pig, yes"
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they will be working on their scheduling to better include UK viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution in terms of the replay," Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won’t be able to resolve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program change upset a lot of people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually a state issue.
I can promise you that won’t happen next time.
We will be showing five games instead of six - as we normally do. We took over our heads in our quest to satisfy the fans.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feeling 'Inferior' Due to Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to his peers during his upbringing because of his sexuality – but it also spurred him on to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize he wasn’t like everyone else until he was in high school.”
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular host, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-time appearance on Laverne's first show, Daley recounts how he felt "less worthy" than others while growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, “This feeling of feeling less worthy and feeling different has been a real source of the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he was “someone,” he said, so he didn’t betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate for LGBT rights, taking advantage of his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said his crush on a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “came as a surprise.”
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” — he attended his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it was hard to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold," he said.
“But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they got their tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London - where he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him: you won't be able to sit on the front row dad," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew this was what I’d been dreaming of all my life — diving in front of a home crowd at an Olympic stadium, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - a song that had followed him until the Olympics and still gave him shivers.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but then he must fix the form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent his day between acting cheerleading and practicing his game in hopes of getting a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even at the peak of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape for the tough course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often penalties miss hard.
It’s not just the course that deters, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson faces champion Francesco Molinari, who together with novice Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points short of the 12 singles matches, have a tailwind at the start, Mickelson's match could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“There’s nothing wrong with his self-confidence.
He is a celebrity and he has contributed so much to these teams in previous seasons and over the past week.
I didn’t think he would be able to play two games.
I thought he could do more, but now it's as it is and we'll have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson passed Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He brings so much more than just games.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon be a mere memory
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team under Seve Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but ultimately won by the smallest possible margin with the result 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"It reminds you that we led big at Valderrama, we led big at Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won hardly," Bjorn said after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday and leads with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we will give everything.
Go out and do everything right.
This isn't over until we see the score on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this trophy and that is where our focus is.
I’ve said it all along, I’m focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we’re well aware of what’s waiting on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Björn was pleased with his players’ performances on a tough golf course and added: “I would never be able to do this on my own.
Tomorrow, new challenges await us.
Tomorrow, it is the individual achievements that matter and that is a completely different matter.
It’s fun to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there on your own, your golfing skills are fully tested.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also has to go and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bear, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major reversals during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to go out as fast as on Brookline, as on Medinah.
When the pace starts in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediate matches.
We did our lineup and placed the guys as we wanted to to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the game and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter face the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I joined this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," Bjorn said of his single picks.
Germany's new warships postponed again
The German Navy’s newest frigate would have been launched in 2014 to replace Cold War warships, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to faulty systems and high costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Palatinate", the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet as early as 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were fatal to the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen frigates.
They will include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and naval missiles, as well as certain stealth techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships – which allow Germany to project power overseas – are already obsolete when they are put into operation, Die Zeit writes.
The fateful F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware failures" that made the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
Deficiencies in the software were particularly important because ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be powered by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the crew of older frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship has a significant excess weight, leading to a deterioration in performance and limiting the navy's ability to perform future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhineland-Palatinate" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the entire project’s price tag – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is said to have amounted to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion at the start-up stage.
Problems affecting the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament’s Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet is actually “starting to have a shortage of fully equipped ships”.
The official said that this is a growing problem, as old vessels are being dismantled but no replacement vessels were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust eavesdrop on the secret lives of bats
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow south and midget pipistrells as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as attacks from domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, audit nests, and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threave we have a good area for bats," he said.
“We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a host of favorable habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for bats before performing maintenance in real estate, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, bother or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects rape conviction while his lawyers threaten to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him “fake news” and says that people “want to market themselves” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forwards have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as “fake news” when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the claims were reported.
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today was fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to market themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a lucky man and all good,” the player said, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations, which they have called "an unauthorized reporting of suspicions of integrity," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral harm to an amount equal to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was “99 percent” a “good guy” betrayed by the “last percent.”
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to a settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and was worried about "being humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a deal of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturers
The UK “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as the world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stoppages in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems regarding what automakers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without a settlement.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, it could lead to disruptions at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day’s supply in stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and hence production would be forced to stop.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid border checks".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows, as I say, not only success at the moment to be appreciated now, but for us to seize this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4's program Today.
“The statement from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the Unite union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: “My experience is that these jobs will never come back.
A government official said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “shot in another week” while the fight against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, Trump-Russia relations and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of carrying interception equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president via the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports of his resignation emerged.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Legal Committee's hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke to Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date for that has not been set, it could happen this week, or a one-week postponement given all the other things happening at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some reporters would dispute that claim: Sanders hasn’t had a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to any disapproval of TV reporters who “play for the gallery,” although she said, “I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery.”
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president holds more question sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding without quoting evidence: “We’ve been looking at these numbers.”
Conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you’ve seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, perhaps, the president showed why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances in front of the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland regarding concerns about Brexit
The health minister has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish that they stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of discontinued status applications for EU citizens working in the decentralised public sector of the country.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, in view of decisions expected to come this autumn.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that empower and improve health care work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's loss by 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennesseans reported Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher was carried out for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/amplitude of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him a season total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers pay higher stamp taxes when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help the homeless, according to the Tory Party’s new plans
The measure will neutralize Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The UK Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless, as will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in the stamp duty will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will give a boost to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on holiday homes and dwellings purchased for rent, and may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will withdraw up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK, pushing up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new move comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to waive quotas on affordable housing to resolve Britain’s “deplorable housing situation.”
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a startling range of proposals for housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to evictions without the tenant’s fault.
He also wants to give municipalities more opportunities to build new homes.
Theresa May says: “Last year I said I would devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream, that life will be better for each new generation.
This means solving problems in the housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and even for companies based abroad, to buy homes as it is for hard-working residents of our country.
The dream of owning a home has become for too many people just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to someday become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old shooter is looking forward to the challenge of breathing life into the club from the northeast of England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a match in the B national team and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
“But growing up, I watched a lot of Scotland at Hampden with my dad, and it’s always attracted me back.
But that opportunity can only come if I manage to lead a club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about succeeding such established names in such a big club. He has previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment I judge success by the answer to the question ‘can I get this club back to the Premier League?’
“This club definitely belongs in the Premier League, given its structure and talent,” he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross has only coached for three years, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month sejour as a member of the Hearts coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa get back from relegation to the Third Division, lifting St Mirren from being close to relegation to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he is more at ease now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a crossroads," he recalls, referring to when he took command of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was just right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had good results and could live on it decently. In addition, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There is a lot you have to get through every week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but exercising feels just right.
I’ve always wanted to exercise and now I do. I feel better than I’ve ever done in my entire adult life.”

A survey shows that the perfect time to have a beer is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heatwave has meant increased revenues for the country’s struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have been put under greater pressure.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “Continuing beautiful weather and the fact that England stayed in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when pubs went up by 2.8%.
The decline in restaurant turnover by 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly offer drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubs offering food also had a hard time in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People just seem to want to go out and drink something.
The drop in managed pubs and bars went up beverage sales by 6.6% that month, and food sales went down by 3%."
Paul Newman, RSM analyst, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors when it comes to sales in the catering market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups are still facing difficulties, even though a 4.8% reduction in sales each year is particularly difficult to manage beyond ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come more inconvenient for businesses run by food sales. Time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give any much needed pause."
The overall sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industry sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant industry in the UK, is collecting and analyzing data on the performance of 47 active groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.

A survey of 20,000 high school students shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased concern that it is sexual content that is posted there
20% of students said they had a “main account” that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, create accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta accounts,” a reference to the photo sharing service Instagram.
The result has added to the concern that sexual content is being posted there.
20% of students said they have a cleaned “master account” that they can show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret page found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
According to the study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most prized athleticist, and chairman Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her broad experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has won great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are confident that the athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly from her becoming a member of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, has a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost the ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would recover, and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’ve fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I’m doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!”
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with cows sharing internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused disagreements on the internet with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To pay attention to the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired commercial with humorous accents to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers who pump breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a hay-filled barn with cows to a song with lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't know, this isn't a udder, it's tits."
The chorus continues: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the commercial, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from viewers. Many say it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their young are taken away from them just a few days after birth.”

Another commented: “You understand that it’s traumatic for both mother and child.
But sure, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another adds: "What a reality-free commercial."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
“I think this is genius.
I would have gotten one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
"This is a brilliant product," he wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny commercial that caters to mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.”
This is not a film that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump tucked into the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes, and can be worn discreetly in a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin is a co-owner and ECD at Mother, and she says: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and dairy cows, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and its challenges, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and easily recognizable way what an incredible sense of freedom the new pump provides.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk wearing clothes by designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved Silently to a Tent Camp Near the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has skyrocketed even though the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged, partly because hateful rhetoric and harsh policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place the children with reference persons.
In the past, most reference persons themselves were undocumented immigrants, and feared to put their own chances of staying in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to accept a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would be required to provide fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be reference persons for unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested were not previously known to law enforcement authorities.
"Almost 80% of the people who are either themselves reference persons or family members of the reference persons are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecute these individuals,” Albence said.
In order to deal with children's cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as previously practiced, according to staff at the shelters.
Many of them are present on video link rather than in person to bring their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not deemed to be entitled to protection are quickly deported.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to suffer anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to staff at the shelters and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say the concern is rising at larger facilities like Tornillo, where signs that a child is having a hard time are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that moving children to the tent town without enough time to prepare emotionally and say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the traumas many are already struggling with.
Syria calls for US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said the government in Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the circumstances are good for them to return home, accusing "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that make refugees stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
“They are politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russo-Turkish agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines," and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and members of the opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set terms for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that the group’s work would be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution,” and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless his presidency ended prematurely through impeachment and scandal, which many liberal viewers probably hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!”
There are no signs that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are nearly three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the charts for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during major news nights.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama Designated Survivor, which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club."
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Nell Scovell told me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the reporting from Washington can determine the future of the abortion case, Roe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the prosperity of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one has suddenly sat and looked for six hours at an expert panel debating Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background sources” for his book Fear, Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather bomber jacket (“a garment filled with hubris,” as the Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel’s husband’s description.
I will never watch Super Mario again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he comes up with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the Trump series' rotating cast and daily intrigue (muck quarrels with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single episode, you are left behind.
When I spoke to television producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai, Hawaii, but he was owling indoors watching MSNBC while recording a CNN broadcast.
He could not toil, not when Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court lay in the balance.
"I remember when we did all those crazy shows in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the smoothest race ever before the midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional district is receiving a ton of money, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district that has led to two members now competing for the same seat.
This newly redesigned suburban district of Pittsburg is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who took his seat in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb is campaigning against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally altered in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign funding battle between the major party economics sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely watched special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain head start.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for China support, but then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the partners evicted the Trump organization’s leadership team.
U.S. State Department officials decided to recall the heads of U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control and development and financial aid.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit hard on the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which effectively put an end to considerations of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which is now due to take place in mid-October. It is a sign of how important the presidential administration considers the meeting to be, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke anonymously.
Study the story
The next unavoidable step could be special investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Donald Trump’s alleged abuse in court, for which there is now tangible evidence in public records.
Mueller also reportedly directs his investigation into whether Donald Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the US election.
Should Congress change majority, Trump will be held accountable to that assembly just as he prepares to run for office once again, and perhaps finally before a civil jury.
There are many uncertainties in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor will his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the struggle can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had stood up to him and backed the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the relentless advance of democracy is either speeded up or slowed down.
Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what is going to happen to Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he allegedly proposed secretly recording the president, speculating that he would not be fit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
“How should we respond if the FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most importantly, will we in the midterm elections vote for a Congress that holds Donald Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I do not think we will fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off to light Sabbath candles on the table decorated with the swastika.
With that as an inheritance, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about Rapid Vienna
Rangers will receive Rapid Wien on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal that ended in a draw earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season, until the 2–2 match against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to greater success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game thinking we could get something, and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have got it in at the end, but on the whole, I think a tie was a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half. We came back in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is going to be an important night in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game. They got a good result in their last game, but if we have the audience with us, we can certainly advance and get a good result.
"Last year was very tough, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The squad is good and the guys are having fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put last season behind us and succeed well.”
Women sleep poorly because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they want to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the step and talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care unless you tell them how you want it in good time.
Work with your counselor and family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices can have a big impact on costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choices of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover the costs, or a self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford.
Establish legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the outset.
Establish a care warrant, so that you can appoint a trusted person who oversees your medical care and ensures that the caregiver follows your wishes, should you become unable to communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who ends up in an emergency medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medications are these?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready.”
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air rifles as he walked home from a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m., as a "single incident".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police urge witnesses to contact them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu, Indonesia last Friday, officials said. The death toll is expected to rise.
Communications have been cut off, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the Donggala administrative district, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated at 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a administrative area that stretches along more than 300 km of the northwestern coast of Sulawesi.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
The economic pillars of the province of Central Sulawesi are fisheries and agriculture, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami hit western Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circumpacific seismic fire ring, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters triggered. Dozens of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the administrative district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding people of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for interfering with a report of domestic violence, and for opposing the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in Mat-Su prison and is being held against a $500 bail to be paid if the suspect violates the bail terms, according to KTUU TV channel.
He appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded "guaranteed not guilty" when asked to state his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three Class A lesser crimes, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a case of Class B less serious crime, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being dealt with by the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons under influence in connection with that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder, which stems from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
The electricity supply and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Movies showing when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors call for rare death penalty for suspect of terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been enforced for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck from the construction and interior design chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclists in his path at the attack, which took place in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to the letter of intent on the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could amount to a death sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was indicted by a federal jury on 22 counts, including eight murders to support patronage activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as the assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “extensive planning and intent,” the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as “abominable, cruel and inhumane.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco injury and loss.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has not prosecuted a case in which the death penalty has been demanded for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of stamping for espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack.
Police said he told investigators he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he got inspiration for the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to put up the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to plead the death penalty instead of agreeing to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if the defendant pleads guilty only prolongs the trauma that these events have caused to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s team of lawyers had previously asked prosecutors not to plead the death penalty.
MEP from Tories says NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must “feel the heat” of the Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s own MEPs suggested he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MEP Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that the UK would already have “been out” if Nigel Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge faced by Theresa May in getting the deeply divided supporters to reconcile has been exacerbated by EU-positive Tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive under the attack of Brexit supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should push and try to reach a deal with Brussels despite the backlash, forcing Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package deal and “chaos.”
Bone said at a mass meeting organised by the Leave Means Leave organization in Solihull that he wanted to "spool the Chequers deal".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been at the helm, we would have been out by now," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough district in Parliament, added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to flush the Chequers deal.”
He made clear his opposition to the EU, saying: "We have not fought world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed the claims that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed their minds and now want to stay is completely untrue."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party also attended the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say: 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and among our electoral workers who are out on the streets making sure we get elected.
Put the Chequers deal aside and start listening."
And she added a sharp message addressed to Theresa May: “Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said politicians must “feel the heat” if they fail in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with it.’”
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is close to failing Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists waved banners with the words “Tory members against Brexit” after the group launched this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis of the House of Lords mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
“It’s these people who say they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a pure farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning a "proper think" about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take a "proper think about running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now running for re-election in November against Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who was the deputy chairman of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the subject of speculation that she may be taking on Donald Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th town hall meeting with voters since Donald Trump took office.
Someone asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government. That means a woman at the top."
Man arrested for shooting of LSU basketball player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that a suspect had been arrested for the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 p.m. for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man seen in the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died of this," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via news site 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he had been on the scene and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship after team orders win him over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes’ team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and almost hung out Hamilton on dry as he defended his position during the first two laps, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the depot first and let Hamilton drive into the back of the cluster, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went into the depot a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a bit of wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free at the risk of bidding in place after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held the tires to reach a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
In the end, he came into the depot on the 44th lap but failed to increase the pace during the remaining eight laps when Raikkonen went up to fourth place.
It’s a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a one and a two," Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for maintaining she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, a nominee for the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual assault.
Speaking at a mass rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly take up Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "ugly, nasty and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the nice things that have happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, nasty and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I haven't done it.
I haven't done it.'
Do you remember?
Did you leak, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I haven’t leaked it.”
Wait a minute.
'Have we leaked... No, we haven't leaked anything,' he added, imitating the senator.
The letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied the leak had come from her office.
"I haven't obscured Ford's allegations, I haven't leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she requested."
But her dementia doesn't seem to have suited the president, who, during Saturday evening's meeting, commented on it like this: "I'll tell you one thing, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual offences by three women, and he implied that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by all necessary means.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Belfast Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars earned Friday’s loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Belfast Giants got an early two-goal lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed for the home team before Dwyer re-established Belfast Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard signed for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave the assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who quit at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Belfast Giants were in the lead at the first break when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again signed with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth halfway through the final period.
The Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers killed so that hundreds of people on one plane could escape from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now being hailed as a hero after he died making sure a plane with hundreds of people on board could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in the rubble of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of people’s lives, according to Australian television channel ABC News.
“We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We are devastated to hear this,” he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death toll could rise to over a thousand people. The country's emergency relief agency says there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is believed to continue to rise because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six-meter high waves have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with dead bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help survivors, but we don't know what they will be faced with there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes on Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says man missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific now reports that a man is missing. Earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the airport on the Chuuk Islands.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was slipping past the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew in at a very low altitude.
"It's extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby in developing a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane sank in the 30-meter deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday closed its plea in the second trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
US Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified last Saturday, saying he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis erased Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip-hop has come a long way from its origins in political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently gained a boost in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
A nanny in New York sues a couple for dismissal after a “racist” text message
A nanny in New York sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a mis-sent text message from her mother, who complained that she was “a black again.”
The couple denied that they were racists and compared the mood to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed horror when she realized that the new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NOT BLACK AGAIN," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "unhappy" and fired Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was instead expecting a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home in a taxi.
Now she is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal. She is claiming compensation of about $350 per day for the job she was initially hired to do, which would last for six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she told the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple dismissed the allegations that they were racists, saying that the only straight line was to terminate Giselle Maurice's employment, fearing that they would not be able to trust her after they had insulted her.
“My wife had sent her something that she didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone you’d been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood to "extortion" and said that his wife would give birth two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Should you go after such a person?
That's not very nicely done," added investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticized them for their behavior and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers didn’t think readers would be able to relate to a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Michael Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented: “It’s hard to imagine what it was like for a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very funny, given what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman on the BBC before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterly sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," adding that her father was proud in silence of his final success.
“He was quite quiet, and not a boastful person,” she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something. One becomes proud of the child even if it is not you who have accomplished it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Even if it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give Paddington himself the credit."
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that you weren't expecting her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was turned off.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this was happening.
I could not howl or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to pull myself together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the severe trial she was going through.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
"I bowed my head, and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women put up postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression, and took his own life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells us that her son was a promising cook who had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile brightened the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was “in a very dark place.”
Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his sibling after he had committed suicide in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm always worried about the consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost her partner since 15 years, Mark, some time after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was behaving differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom and when the kids opened their Christmas presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard blow to them, but they have to get through it. "It tears up a wound in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we all have to fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI opens an investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for -- an investigation that is limited in time and scope -- then maybe we could get some agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "divided" due to deep-rooted party differences.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their reluctance depends entirely on the timing.
The midterm elections are scheduled to take place in just five weeks, on November 6. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be greatly weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called senators to persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which now seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors "sinks" under Kim
The number of North Koreans defecting to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislature said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing information from South Korea’s reunification ministry, said 1,127 people dropped out last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges to human traffickers are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the defectors as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back by force.
The North-South relations, which are still technically at war with each other, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on the stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean peninsula to be free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US sanctions of lack of success since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we certainly cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh 'Hysterical' and Says He's Unfit to Serve in Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had acted like that, she would be called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the allegations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotionally touched, and from time to time he almost screamed and his voice stuck when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also expressly condemned the Democrats in the committee, saying the charges against him were a “grotesque and coordinated character assassination” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed he is biased to the detriment of the Democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was elected, and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I can say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he’s on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade abortion measure, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he should change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to sit down in court and expect us to all applaud,” Pelosi said.
Women have to stand up.
It’s a righteous criticism, months and years of anger boiling over, and she can’t get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. Do you think?"
And she continued: “I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sorry because I’m crying.
I'm angry.'
And then she went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to get outlets for anger in part because they are often misunderstood fundamentally.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once cried with indescribable anger, was that I was taken by the collar of an older woman. It was a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and will be happy that they managed to push you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with an illegitimate affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt there was no reason not to investigate the idea of running for president himself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates. The last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since she was late, she was lagging behind with the fundraising, and promised not to go in as a candidate unless she raised $2 million.
It was a project destined to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in a speech that she would not embark on a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotion, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism, that the voice stalled.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schröder recalls about the reaction of the press.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, ‘What will they write on my tombstone?’
“She was crying?”
Why the trade war between the US and China may be good for Beijing
The opening stir in the trade war between the US and China was deafening. The war is far from over, but the gap between the countries could benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week, with new tariffs on $200 billion in goods, which means in practice that half of all goods entering the US from China are tariffed.
Beijing has responded every time with the same coin; recently charges of between five and ten percent were thrown on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match US measures, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to scale down in the foreseeable future.
Getting Washington to back down means bowing to demands, but publicly crawling for the United States would be far too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure of the US trade war can provide positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic panic in either country, and it's actually far more dangerous than viewers have previously wanted to admit," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for returning refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready to accept voluntary returning refugees and appeals for help to rebuild the country, which is in ruins after the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it does not receive conditional support or aid from countries that have supported the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s team achieved the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard for most of the tournament, ended up in the water on the 16th hole's Par 3 lane, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone in all rounds and became one of four players to ever make 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth knocked out 5 & 4 of the European team’s lowest-ranked players, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest-rated player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter of England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups behind him, became the tournament’s most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so thankful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy, so happy to win back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said a touched Garcia after the European team's victory.
He handed over the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single on Sunday.
"What an incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I grew up looking at him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and has now scored 13-21-3 for his career in the Ryder Cup.
An odd statistic for one of the best players in the world ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they've been fighting.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
“We’re going to regroup, I’m going to work with the US PGA Tour and our Ryder Cup committee and we’re going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to bow and bow.
They played better than us.”
Algae bloom: Decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in concentrations of algae blooming for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, uneven blooms are reported in the areas around the municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate a decrease in levels.
The algae bloom extends along more than 200 kilometers of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about a mile and a half into the sea outside the Greater Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algal blooms have also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Medium concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Off the coast of Hillsborough low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida last week.
