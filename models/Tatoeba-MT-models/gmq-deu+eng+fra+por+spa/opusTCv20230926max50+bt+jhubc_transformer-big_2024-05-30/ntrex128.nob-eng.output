Welsh MPs Don’t Want to Appear as ‘Muppets’
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, now known as AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from the entire political spectrum fear that this may lead to ridicule.
A Labour representative explained his group was concerned because “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means “stupid” and pwp means “poop”.
A representative of the Wales party Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was “dissatisfied” and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh section of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of the MWP is very close to the word "Muppet", which in addition to being the name of some well-known dolls, is also a British slang word for "dust".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like an "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the name change, said: “Of course, it is the members themselves who have the final say in the name they should be referred to.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public hearing showing public support for renaming the National Assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
Representatives are allegedly suggesting other options, but getting all parties to come to an agreement could lead to headaches for parliamentary president Elin Jones, who is scheduled to submit a draft law for the name change over the next couple of weeks.
The legislation surrounding the reform will include other changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for the disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the final right to vote on what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide if the country’s name should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia will vote to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour’s name constitutes a claim on its territory, and has on several occasions opposed the country’s applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's are silent – the churches in Harlem are struggling
“The old people I spoke to told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Adams.
“Now there is neither.”
He said the dropouts of the bars were understandable.
“People socialize in other ways,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local community, which everyone visits regularly.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling possessions will not last as long as the leaders think. “And sooner or later they are back at the starting point.”
The churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won’t help the neighborhood’s remaining sanctuaries.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only speed up the day when these churches have to close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin’s had a black congregation under pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of negotiators on 125th Street—one of Harlem’s main shopping streets—for failing to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioners made plans for rebuilding, they bought a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was "the church bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated interaction between architects and contractors, some of whom are contracted by the church's laity leadership and others by the diocese.
The Council of Churches – the church leadership, consisting of laity – wrote to the diocese in July about its concern that the diocese would “try to impose the costs” on the Council, despite the fact that the Council had not been involved in the commissioning of the architects or contractors sent by the Diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures thirteen-year-old at lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he popped for lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help, and that he and a group of others were swimming over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he thought the boy shouted with excitement at catching a lobster, but he eventually realized the boy shouted 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
His entire collarbone was torn,” says Hammel, who discovered the injury when he reached the boy.
“I shouted for everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles also said the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its entrance into the UK beauty care market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-like makeup and beauty shelves, staffed by specially trained staff.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 stores around the country as part of a powerful entry into the UK’s 2.8 million beauty market, which is experiencing steady growth at the same time as sales figures for clothing and home goods are falling. If the experiment proves successful, the concept will expand to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty care is the result of the supermarket’s efforts to find a new use for the space previously used for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's has said it will double the number of beauty products it offers to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the retail chain has never sold before.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also have more space in branded areas, just like in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its Boutique makeup brand with mainly vegan products, as there is increasing demand for this among younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also test sales tables at two Sainsbury's stores, one opening in Croydon, South London last week, and the other opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
E-commerce and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that the outlets will eventually look more and more like a department store, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the cheaper stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempts to upgrade its beauty and pharmacy departments were unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was discontinued after an argument over the distribution of income from supermarket pharmacies.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281 retail pharmacies to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Director of Commerce, said: “We’ve transformed the look and design of beauty shelves to create a more welcoming environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will then be ready to give advice and help.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and the welcoming surroundings and convenient placements make us a beauty competitor that represents a new shopping experience.”
Peter Jones Is 'Enraged' After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones is reportedly furious after TV host Holly Willoughby resigned from an 11-million-dollar deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop.
Willoughby, 37, host of This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones by retiring from their profitable lifestyle brand at the last second to focus on her own new gold-edged contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “enraged” at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. This is where the television’s golden girl admitted that her new deals – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – mean she no longer has time left for their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, and it was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left the UK on her way to one of her vacation homes.
One source said: “Truly was undoubtedly Holly’s number one priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security for the next few decades.
Everyone is shocked that she has decided to resign.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow that are now ready for sale.”
Experts believe the This Morning host, who is among the UK’s most popular stars, could cost the company several million pounds due to major investments in products such as pillows and lights, fashion and cosy clothing, as well as a potential delay in launch.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for the past ten years.
Willoughby formed Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones holds a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
“Then we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment some would consider “little presidential” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give away so much money?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
“I haven’t given anything away.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, having himself declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big dirt on the road to nuclear disarmament by North Korea.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a “similar response” from the US to its early disarmament efforts.
He noted that the United States instead has continued sanctions aimed at keeping up the pressure.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for an audience of his constituents.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results, such as putting an end to missile tests, helping to free hostages and having the remains of U.S. officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami devastate an island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombok’s residents had lost their homes, it was not declared a national disaster, which is a requirement for international aid to be sent in.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it quite clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite challenging,” Sumbung explained.
Save the Children is now putting together a team that will travel to Palu, but is not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Crisis Management Agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Considering the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is terribly ill-prepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Lights to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, although a warning had been issued, has probably contributed to the death toll.
Even in the best of circumstances, travelling between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrading of Indonesia’s dilapidated infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But lack of money has been a major problem for Joko’s administration, which is due to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have turned to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bow and arrow and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with late equaliser in match against Chelse
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from the Premier League loss to Chelsea on Saturday by scoring in the 89th minute of the game at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from the Chelsea goal while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to his left foot before pushing it towards the longest corner.
The attempt drifted high above the can as the ball drooped towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually rushed over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq are always pushing the ball forward as best they can, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touched the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked it on.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at the break, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacking player sent a pass with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing direction near midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick handover in midfield.
He then fired a great breakthrough pass that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the European Football League in London at 3 p.m. on Thursday.
Indonesian tsunami death toll reaches 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country’s crisis management agency announced early Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a 7.5-stroke that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from demolished buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation is underway after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 in Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything to contact them.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I would ask anyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured something on their car camera, to get in touch – they may have information crucial to our investigation.”
A spokesperson for the police has confirmed that the deceased woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police have said they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take several hours before they can get back in.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She says, “It’s terrible” over and over again.
At 2 p.m., two police cars were behind the barricade, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers stood outside the lockdown and supervised the apartment complex.
Persons who have information are asked to send an instant message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111, by referring to “log 247” from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial dragged into the quarrel about "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would have been poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick’s publishing house as “stupid” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace would also become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell is a testament to the opinions of the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a man many still believe deserves to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, as the parliamentary defender against outside pressure – in his time, of course, there was talk of the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating.”
Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, named only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead and covered in blood from a ruptured artery near a binge at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had apparently travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby pork stall was open.
He said inside the pigsty there was a big hog with blood on his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had killed the man.
“My cousin’s bones were bloody and maltreated,” explained his cousin, referred to by the surname Wu, in a quote to the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While police gathered evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan's family and market leadership are allegedly negotiating compensation for the death.
This is not the first time it has been recorded that a pig has attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a farm in Massachusetts, inflicting serious injuries on the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 kg pig until the farmer's wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive as usual, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, and are very curious... they try not to hurt anyone.
You just have to show enough respect.”
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains in the southwest of the United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves across the cooler ocean on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood rains on her journey through northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa had a wind speed of 135 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane at 5:00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
Pink will cause up to 25 cm of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the interaction between tropical humidity and the approaching trough will lead to widespread heavy rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, floating debris and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep-tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5–7 cm per hour in some areas, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5–10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
There are opportunities for flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rains.
It is very unwise to move around the desert on foot as long as there is a risk of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause river valleys to turn into broad rushing rivers, and thunderstorms will cause local gusts that can contain dust and sand.
The approaching trough will cause local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along Southern California.
Total rainfall above 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to floating debris and fast, as well as slippery road surfaces.
This will be the area’s first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, before rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and persist throughout Wednesday.
October may cause some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics stay very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of severe temperature differences throughout the central United States on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is likely to get off to a warm start in October, with degrees high in the twenties from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City could reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates that the eastern United States will most likely have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers across six TV networks saw Thursday’s poignant testimony from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday’s big surprise at the last second, when it came to light that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that she is 100 percent sure a drunken Kavanaugh touched her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent sure this did not happen.
The broadcast on Friday was probably watched by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average ratings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Viewers were not immediately available to other networks showing the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring office viewers.
To give some perspective, these ratings are equivalent to the playoffs of the American Football Championship or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts have supported Kavanaugh’s appointment with great enthusiasm, led the network, with average ratings of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was still a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake was the main character for Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican’s office made a statement that he would vote in Kavanaugh’s favor. On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras as he tried to take the elevator to a court committee meeting while protesters shouted and shouted at him.
He stood with lowered eyes for several minutes while being scolded, while the incident was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling our country the truth?"
“You have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office had made a statement, saying as the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered the hearing directly several hours later, as the court committee was to vote on whether or not Kavanaugh’s nomination should be passed on to the entire Senate for vote.
But Flake said he was only willing to do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate by next week, as the Democratic minority has called for.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake’s election had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of 'political game' around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused opponents of her plan to leave the EU of engaging in “political games” with Britain’s future and undermining the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, pressed side by side with her own on the front page of the paper, her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson has continued her attack on her so-called “Chequers” plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should overtake each other’s tariffs was “absolutely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing LSU player's death
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and charged with intentional murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have released a video footage of the Sims and Simpson confrontation, and police say the Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, according to The Advocate.
The coroner in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, in which the cause of death is stated as a gunshot wound to the head and through the neck.
Police thank Louisiana State Police’s Refugee Capture Task Force, the state’s police laboratory, Southern University police and locals for contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the area's police force for his "hard work and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-foot forward grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "crushed" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
“This is what we fear at all times,” Wade said.
Volcano spills ash over Mexico City
The ashes splashing out of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico's government agency for crisis prevention, warned the people of Mexico on Saturday that they must stay away from the volcano after activity rose in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The agency monitored several cases of bumping and shaking.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after Protestants for independence clashed with police, while thousands took part in competing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing secession vote.
A group of masked separatists were held back by riot police, and bombarded them with eggs and powder paints, causing dark dust clouds in streets usually full of tourists.
Hand riots also broke out later in the day, when police used batons to limit the fighting.
For hours, independence protesters stood and shouted “Never forget, never forgive,” face-to-face with unionist protesters shouting “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they received during the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the October 1 referendum, which was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming majority for secession, but it was poorly attended because the vote was boycotted by most who opposed the liberation.
According to Catalonian authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after police tried to halt the vote that was being conducted at polling stations across the region.
Liberation groups camped on the streets on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held anyway, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia’s possibility of becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy to be able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had trouble keeping up the pressure this year, as many of their dubiously famous leaders have gone into self-imposed exile or are in detention while awaiting trial for their role in arranging the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used her phone to film the protest in support of the police, said the conflict was inflamed by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned in anticipation of a trial since late last year, announced that he will stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
“To stand for election as a candidate in the European elections is the best I can do to condemn the repression and regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car crashed into a house wall
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car crashed into the wall of a Londonderry house.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30pm BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Menga's attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston
Relegated Livinston amazed the Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga proved decisive, and Gary Holt’s side is now equal to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side have still not won away in the Premier League this season and will play against the leaders Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them next Sunday.
The Rangers will play their home game against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, for his part, has remained undefeated through six games in the division. Chief Coach Holt has not yet lost a game after replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Misses Opportunities Against Its Sluggish Guests
Holt’s team should have led long before they scored, as their direct approach caused countless problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only pass the kick on after slipping in to face Craig Halkett header past the goal.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for their guests at a dead ball.
That’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to give Menga clear field, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By this stage, the Rangers had had the ball pretty much all the time, but the home team's defense had proven to be impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos scored a near score that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball in a wide short pass.
Crossings continually entered the Livingston box and were continually rescued, while two penalties – once after Halkett’s protest against substitute Glenn Middleton, and once at hand – were overlooked.
“Phänomenally” from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing and continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The style of play and the crew have barely changed since they got back to the top, but Holt is credited with the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated an enormously well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, did not have my inspiration to show.
Although they have at times been very good under Gerrard, they failed to live up to this standard.
The last part of the game was lax – they only made it into the home team’s half once – and it was a bit of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smiles and blue skies on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
Differences have arisen over issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security as the reason why a crowd of 25,000 was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also spoke out, criticizing both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to allow him into the country.
The contradictory demonstrations reflect the discord that follows a man hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford collision: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by paramedics, but the man died at the scene.
The crash occurred just one month after a cyclist died in a crash in which the driver escaped from the scene on Children's Street, about a mile from Saturday's collision.
The Metropolitan Police said police are working to identify the man and notify the relatives.
Roadblocks and bus detours are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an incident at a men's high-security prison, according to prison authorities.
Riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday, and are still going on.
Specialized “Tornado” officers have been brought in to deal with the incident, involving eight inmates and are limited to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesperson said: “Specially trained prison staff have been sent in to handle an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police and may have to spend even more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, riot police were called in to deal with a serious incident in which employees were attacked with billiards bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (may be beneficial for drought areas)
It’s the rare tropical depression in Arizona, but it’s likely to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining power moves through the deserts to the southwest, causing flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain will start late Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has remarked on Twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the Arizona border.”
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm in some places in the Mongollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to gain between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those who are out of flood danger, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, since the southwestern United States is currently in a drought state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, which is the second highest category,” according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa hits land at the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km, is located 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is moving at 19 km/h.
The storm hits colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday evening or afternoon.
Precipitation in parts of Mexico can be severe and cause major flooding.
“Total rainfall of 7.5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm of precipitation,” according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, moving further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected of Rosa or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," according to the National Hurricane Center.
This precipitation is expected to produce deadly flooding and floating debris and rapid in the desert and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. BST on Sunday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked anyone who might have a mobile phone record of the incident to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered under the pettiness and anger of the Democratic Party
“A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has suffered under the pettiness and anger of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about his accusations during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw how brilliant, capable and courageous” Kavanaugh was that day.
“A vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in support of one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, with impeccable conduct in public service,” he told an audience of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president discreetly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
I’m not really a participant, but I’m a participant,” he said.
“That’s why I travel around fighting for the best candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats wanted to “resist and hinder.”
The Senate’s first mid-term vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to the assistant of a Republican party leader.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian landslide and tsunami, numbers expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged out to sea by huge waves thundering against the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six-meter-high waves pounded ashore around sunset, destroying everything in its path and dragging many into the drowning dead.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still engaged in activities on the beach, did not escape immediately and ended up as victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Crisis Management Agency (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami wasn’t alone – it dragged cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.”
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the crisis management agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and broken bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Department of Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) said in a statement that the power of Friday’s huge earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's location at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami bigger, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater land coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
Communication “was completely crippled, completely without information” from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but authorities said the waves had hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, one hears a man on the top floor of a building shouting desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching bystanders on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes thundering toward the beach, tearing away buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that has obstructed communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other necessities.
The airport is only open for relief work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's awful.
World Vision staff from Donggala have made it safely to downtown Palu, where they have sought shelter under tarpaulin tents in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed major devastation along the way, according to Doseba Sinay.
“They told me they saw hundreds of ruined houses,” he said.
It's awful.
As relief organizations began the grim preparations to deliver emergency relief, some complained that foreign aid workers with much expertise were denied the right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘All right, this is a national disaster’ we can open the borders to international aid, but the situation has not been given any status yet.”
As the sun sets over Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that brighten the gloomy news after tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was caught fishing out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued after spending two days trapped under ruins with the body of her mother beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those trapped in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mondayi, were also his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread in the paragliding community, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes who participated in the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only resulted in gray chin marks, rather than a couple of blue chin marks.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who filled an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was getting ready to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man “runs up behind the Brink’s employee” and steals a money bag to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects escaping from the scene, according to the press release, but police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identity must contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The creature formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He is replacing singer Ariana Grande on the show, after she cancelled on "emotional grounds," according to the series creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s us.
It went from being Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also varied between the use of hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexico’s president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he “will never ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Military troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education leads young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Financial Support for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, for its part, launched a plan last year and aims to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough,” Lee said.
“Double financial support could double the chance of the next major achievement in artificial intelligence coming from the United States,” Lee said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the foremost artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop an artificial intelligence system that beat America’s best Othello player, and later served as a leader at Microsoft Research or director of Google’s Chinese department.
Lee recognized the U.S. government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation of wise heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government grants, according to Lee.
“It’s not China that’s stealing the academic leaders, it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired wise minds from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those with a doctorate in artificial intelligence should receive offers of residence permits automatically,” he said.
The Chinese government issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions, in a similar way to the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations distributing money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they are currently investing more than $100 million in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the US legislation aiming to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been halted for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday whether to change the country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia” to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, believes that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim on Greek territory and has vetoed their inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has created doubts whether the turnout will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by approving the agreement with Greece?"
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to gain membership in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it will probably be decisive, because a high enough number of MEPs have said they will abide by the result of the vote.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission has said they had not received any irregularity reports by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors for them to become members of NATO and the EU.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those to boycott the vote.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to be signed in with our heads up, not be let in by the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we are worthy.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
He says a “yes” answer would be a “affirmation of our future.”
According to a poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will attend the referendum – lower than the required turnout.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of blacks are planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the attendance must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers past Brighton's entire defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling smashed the Brighton defence in Manchester City’s 2–0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacking player received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He raced against three Brighton defenders before entering the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before running away from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
He then sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English striker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right shoe to beat Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
“We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
He was lucky to score a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the original advantage in the Premier League game.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball deposited in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few touches before leading Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacking player threw the ball into the net just before it was over the dead line.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a Rockies spoiler
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs and have no reason to bet heavily.
The ever-competitive Scherzer still hopes to be on the pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff opportunities of the Colorado team, who lead the Los Angeles Dodgers by one game in the NL West.
The Rockies earned a wild card spot with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
“While we don’t have anything to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will most likely be the highest level of game I’ll be able to play this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to take Scherzer's pitch in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is the starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has this season won 18 games and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump's People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president discreetly referred to the situation surrounding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big ones... I’m not a contestant, but I’m a contestant. That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this gruesome, gruesome group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take back power at all costs, and there you see the pettiness and the meanness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, aim to “resist and hinder.”
“And you see it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and mean and nasty and dishonest.”
He referred to the Senate Court Committee and mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, whereupon the audience bowed loudly.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I’m expecting one – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don’t tolerate people who give their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome just because we say what we mean.
My fellow MEP Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was going to be censored because I didn’t agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding how important it is to have responsible economic policies, regarding national security, regarding Europe – ironically similar issues that de Jeremy disagreed with former leaders on.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said, “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been just that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood at many of the meetings, and the promise of “softer, kinder” politics has long since been forgotten, if at all it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I previously thought I shared many political views with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, agreed they were about national security or the EU’s internal market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – I receive a wealth of ugly messages on social media demanding my resignation, condemning downtown politics and telling me that I shouldn’t be in Labour.
And I’m not the only one who has experienced this.
I know I’m luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they face an ocean of sexist and racist comments every day, but never subdued.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how gross insults have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every motion of no confidence and every change in the electoral rules makes the party narrower.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the past two years where I’m encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will “make everything better.”
But that’s not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the Thatcher government’s neglect that had left my classroom in the public school I attended literally dilapidated, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councilman and as a minister of government.
I have never concealed my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can have in any way misunderstood my political views or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the representative proposal on Friday, I just want to say that as the country rages our way towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot comprehend the desire to waste time and effort on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political uncompromising will prevent me from doing what I think best serves your interests.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the end result slightly, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this fantastically entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They are now at the top of the table and are the only undefeated of the ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities they got that led to the home team winning, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be happy.
“We have been challenged in our fights so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy with that,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “All credit to Ayr, they were better at taking advantage of the opportunities than we were.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, with a goal kick from Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to equalize the score, and Jason Baggot scored a goal-kick attempt.
Climo strengthened Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before he scored and kicked a solo attempt to change his score to 17–5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, with a goal kick from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This resulted in a prolonged stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on a stretcher, and from the reboot Ayr increased the lead even more by a try from Stafford McDowell, with a goal kick from Clima.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, was then given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the field to the fullest with an attempt by Bruce Colvine without a goal kick, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Clima when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown by throwing in behind the advancing Ayr Maul.
Climo scored a goal kick, as he did again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe overtook David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanks Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to be on his way into the hospitality industry – it was recently discovered that he is named as the director of a restaurant company with a dish grant.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, for which he writes the script and plays with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pigeon has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' final, and it appears Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “lively restaurant business.”
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, a country without a coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rig-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.”
The entire inland state of Bolivia still remembers the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century, and the country longs to once again sail the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be greater than they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits an International Court of Justice ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has drive, community spirit and peace of mind, and of course awaits the outcome with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ruling of the International Court of Justice on a large screen in many different parts of the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that Chile – after decades of sporadic negotiations – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a separate outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – who faces a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also staked heavily on Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to a return to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to take the side of Bolivia, and that very little would change if it had.
The UN agency, like the team in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean land, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than advancing Bolivia’s cause, the past four years may actually have made things worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has devoured any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations on some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velzé, Bolivia’s representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court’s decision came unusually quickly.
According to him, Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “put an end to 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both parties.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – has used the maritime situation as a political cover-up.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
“Knowledge is an opportunity to see what we have to do to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen unless they can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not rely on the US government.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by the promises they made during a meeting between the two opposing leaders in Singapore.
These comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears ready to launch the stalemate of nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “dream” that continued sanctions and US opposition to a declaration that ends the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
The U.S. government is skeptical about accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt whether Pyongyang really plans to let go of an arsenal the country probably sees as the only security guarantee it has.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveal the Latest in Huge Headwear Heading to a Clothing Store Near You
If you want some great additions to your hat collection or hide completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of quirky, oversized headgear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the fashion lions at the fashion week in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most sensational garment was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a feather-like wide brim that drowned the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, or even a pineapple, but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had resewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation was reminiscent of diving equipment, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you’re looking for even more big fashion accessories, then you’re in luck.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be heading for a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right on the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a half-meter-wide brim that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent yet another big creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as big as the swimsuit model that wears it.
The orange raffia bag, edged with raffia fringes and complemented by a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – when the designer has had such a big impact it will be hard to overlook the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland’s free schools continue to demonstrate academic excellence, and this has persisted in 2018 with another year of outstanding exam results, supported by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, these schools employ more than 30,000 students across Scotland and work hard to deliver the very best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational body that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages are increasingly a popular and in-demand elective in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the words reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s exam results, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest passing percentages from free schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages received the exam grade A.
The data, obtained from the 74 member schools of the Free School Council, showed that 72 per cent of students received an A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This illustrates that free schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and young people are undoubtedly going to need in the future.
Languages as subject choices are now valued at the same level as natural sciences such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics on the curriculum for free schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that of the reasons employers stated for having difficulty filling a vacancy, 17% could be attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become essential in a globalized world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investing in language learning is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those associated with emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most valuable to the UK on their way to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a choice of languages to choose from at free schools, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that languages are constantly crucial to the country’s future, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills.”
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and distinction to Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is still unclear.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After a rehearsal earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need preseason games at this stage of my career,” he said.
Time for Trump's West Virginia People's Congress, YouTube channel
President starts a series of election rallying tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five scheduled public meetings over the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his nominee for the Supreme Court is put on hold, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump’s West Virginia referendum tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual assault. An expected confirmation vote has been put on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates the case.
With the main goal of all these rallies being to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has said that these five rallies over the next few weeks aim to “incite volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congressional control is so crucial to his agenda that the president wants to travel to as many states as possible as we move toward a busy campaign season,” a campaign spokesperson for Trump told Reuters.
The evening’s public meeting, scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be covered by the Pittsburgh press,” according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political science expert at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit to keep faith as they enter Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes may have been exactly what this year’s Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum’s swinging pendulum is a completely fictional sport concept, yet something players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
“They led by six points and now it’s four, so I guess we’re carrying that with us as a bit of momentum,” Spieth said.
Europe will of course have the advantage – they lead with four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, Americans feel like they’ve got a little wind again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent play from tee to green, and leads by example.
The deep celebratory screams grew louder as his round continued, and sank to a decisive putt to raise the match to a draw when he and Thomas were two down after two.
His putting, which won them the match at 15, was met with a similar scream – of the sort that shows he still doesn’t think the American team is chanceless.
“We really just have to put all the cloths in and focus on our own match,” Spieth said.
That's all each of these players has now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly the Ryder Cup’s great success stories.
Europe’s unusual but lovely couples have four out of four and don’t put a foot wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair to avoid a bogey on Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday's biggest competitors, and there is no other player the public would rather see secure a European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time, in each hole.
It is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily hooked up with Sergio Garcia, the morning fourballs hero, when he partnered with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles during the first nine holes, the Spaniard and Swede were so far behind that they did not have the chance to catch up.
But on Sunday, there is no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to watch up close because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give each other, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can turn around in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that Team USA has the fighting spirit some, especially in the United States, have missed.
Europe lead 10-6 at the start of last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong head start at the start of the Ryder Cup’s final day, after completing Sunday’s fourballs and foursomes games with a 10–6 lead against the United States.
Brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories against a broken Tiger Woods, raising their score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s European side, struggling to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America’s unfortunate side in this morning’s fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. gave more opposition in the foursomes and won two games, but they did not catch up.
Jim Furyk's side will have to collect eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, and he and Molinari – nicknamed “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the only couple to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they seamlessly collaborated to beat broken Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who limped through two games on Saturday, glimpsed occasionally, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in the foursomes and performed a 2&1 win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe didn’t get everything the way it wanted on this hot day of light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won the majors three times, set the standard for Americans by two points on Saturday.
They scored a hard-won 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team recovered from a four-point lead at the start of the singles game, but as current holders, only Furyk's side needs to tie to keep the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it seems they will not be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will “in no way” agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened suspicion of the United States and that it would in no way agree to unilaterally relinquish its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea has undertaken “significant goodwill efforts” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and promising not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have not seen a similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to gradual nuclear disarmament, with North Korea being rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on June 12, at the very first meeting between a incumbent president of the United States and a North Korean leader, in which Kim pledged to work toward “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean War from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’ and raises the pressure via sanctions to achieve its goal by force, even opposing the ‘declaration on the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can put us on our knees is a dream come true for people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second hit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed before the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If the other party to this disarmament issue were South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as locked up as it is.”
However, the tone of Ris’ speech was very different from last year’s, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the mainland by North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, this year Trump stood before the UN and praised Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said much work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is nuclear-defused.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a timeframe for this, saying, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s sanctions must still be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to throttle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and afterwards said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying they had made progress, but just hours later North Korea accused him of making “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to close down a missile area and a nuclear facility if the United States took “similar measures.”
He said Kim had said that these “similar measures” he wants were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Courses in Getting Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students get more sleep by tackling the growing uncultured memorization of the night with caffeine drinks as fuel.
An academic found that students at the world’s best university often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“After the talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why has no one said this before?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to the students how important it is to have good sleep habits in order to perform academically and athletically, and for the general condition.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and president of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw students suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive exercises.
In one section, there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important a sleep routine is.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campuses with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this is not going to change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know about this, just as you have a right to know about the risks of smoking,” Professor Czeisler said.
There is still a certain pride in being able to study all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Enough and good sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, leading to constant hunger sensations.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, taking one of the professor’s classes last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course inspired him to work for a course that was available to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master’s students to take a similar study programme before enrolling at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm for when to go to bed as well as for when to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic displays and LED lights. This type of light can disrupt circadian rhythms and lead to insomnia.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Goal of Menga knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another away loss when Dolly Menga's goal defeated Steven Gerrard's team 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to get their first win since February's 4–1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager, leaving his eight points behind from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers were never able to equalize.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place, while Livingston climbs to third and is behind Hibernian on goal difference.
There may be more trouble awaiting Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an item was thrown from away audiences.
Gerrard made eight switches on the team, sweeping past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been delighted how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
The Rangers had perhaps the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored just two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the goal rod.
The Rangers took control, but it looked like their game relied more on hope than faith on the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have had a penalty kick after 15 minutes, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson refused.
The Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opening in the 34th minute may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he selected Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent during the break, and the switch gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
However, Livingston managed to get the away players to play exactly the kind of game they liked, as Lithgow and Halkett caught a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the lead in the last half, but McGregor faced Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had yet another late penalty claim as he came into conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
The Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we know today as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been an important part of science since then, and also became a part of popular culture through the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What on earth is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “I’m going to say it makes a noise now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he gave his name to, lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to 'See' Cancer Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to 'See' Cancer Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
The cells can now “see” a protein that is common in many cancers, and are then injected into the patient again.
A vaccine under trial has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer she suffered from disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical for many cancers, and then injecting these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drives the growth of various cancers,” including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and “trained” to target cancer cells, has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, made a fierce defense of Trump after the SNL appearance.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was bowed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a groping performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he honed out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“It happens so often that I talk to a white person and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
“If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judicial Committee about the sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he heard it in the back room regarding the choice of headgear.
“They bullied me.
They said, “Don’t go out there with that hat on.”
They bullied me!
And then they said I don’t understand what the reality is,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want me to understand what the reality is?” he said, saying he was going to “put on my Superman coat, because then no one can tell me what to do.
“Try love.”
His comments were curved at least twice, and the employees who worked at SNL looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one staff member saying, “The entire studio became dead silent.”
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP WITH THE MASSES.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just “who he is and it’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) which I believe cultivates and spews out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
And so are we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that from now on, he was "formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper colleague Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion. Then there is of course the late music legend Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington sets out against 'gifty masculinity'
Kit Harington is known for the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series set in the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles in movies often make young men think they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something has gone wrong and wondered how to address the problem of “toxic masculinity” in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was very interested in the theme.
“It worries me a lot these days – where did it go wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that TV may have part of the blame for the increase in “toxic masculinity” due to the strongly masculine roles.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What is conveyed on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate this particular aspect of being a man?
I think that’s one of the really big questions of our time – how can we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any predecessor or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he is "done with battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kit's character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, a health official said.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases are transmitted via sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China through blood transfusions.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now closer to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year by year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the disease transmission is due to insufficient protection during sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged public access to HIV medicine as part of a measure to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked data on Republican senators, sniffing out “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Member of the House, Maxine Waters, denied charges that members of her staff had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles insured by the allegations was made by “ultraconservative” commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the abuse allegations against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, Hill said.
“This unfounded allegation is completely false and an outright lie,” Waters said.
“The members of my staff – whose identities, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – were absolutely not responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an outright lie.”
Waters’s statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is aggressive,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They must not go to defense.
They must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
You have to act calmly and calmly.”
Fleischer compared Waters’s reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too aggressive during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate working to remove Waters in the midterm elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
“Big, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted “relevant authorities and police to these false allegations.”
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all actions that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson in Spy Parody
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit insinuations in all new films with a British slant and it seems to be applicable to this revival of the parody franchise Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurrected in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satire about how obviously hopeless we are become the nation’s new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and rubber face has been renewed his license to mess it up for the second time – his name says more than anything that he is a distinct and comic figure intended for territories with non-English speaking cinema audiences.
He is, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a fancy Mr Bean, and a portion of the guy who contributes a single note to the fire cart-themed music feature at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the role of Atkinson in the long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials; the traveler and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
It's an occasional great moment in the recent Johnny English mission.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades carved his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to life, but the humor feels pretty anemic and strangely redundant, especially now that the "serious" brands like 007 and Mission Impossible willingly have comedy elements.
The humor seems to be more directed at children than adults, and to me, Johnny English’s fades are not as inventive and pointed as the silent film lies in Mr Bean.
The current premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identities of all the British agents in the field, to the dismay of the guarding agent – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last drop for a prime minister, a pompous and depressed figure who’s already going through a complete crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this pretend-Teresa-May role, but the script doesn’t give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy has been exposed, she must bring in someone among the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a snobbish establishment, but unofficially teaches secret intelligence. There are some funny sequences here, when English offers a rock academy for spying activity.
English is snatched back to Whitehall for a quick briefing and reunited with his old, troubled helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, paired with a submarine commander, a hysterical upper-class lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So the Batman and Robin style of messing things up on queen missions is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko's amazing femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s cyber problems: the insidious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey with farcical setbacks: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant, wreak havoc while hiding aboard Volta’s luxury yacht; and English unleashes sheer anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to make a name for himself in Volta’s house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the final sequence, but even so gracious and noisy it is so much like children's TV with the whole thing.
Pretty mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he can really use his talent?
Labour denies plans to allow British workers to work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party will consider a radical plan that will give the UK a four-day working week – but get paid for five.
The party apparently wants business leaders to spend savings on the artificial intelligence revolution by giving workers an extra weekday off.
This means that the employees will receive a three-day weekend while receiving the same salary.
Sources say the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in favor of workers.
The unions support the transition to a four-day week so that workers can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits with the party’s desire to swing the pendulum to the benefit of workers – in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea; the Green Party promised a four-day week during the campaign ahead of the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said, “A four-day week is not the party’s policy and is not something that is considered by the party.”
Labour’s fiscal spokesman, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “profits” of public service providers.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies are in danger of not getting their entire shareholding back because a Labour government can make “deductions” based on perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and create employee funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private sector companies to employees, who can receive an annual dividend of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview aired Sunday, Correspondent Scott Pelley of "60 Minutes" asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the start of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, inclined, unambiguous".
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
“I’ve made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and if so, it had to be a startling discovery,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it energetically," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she mentioned could not confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t think anything new will change that.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped fight poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission: eradicate the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will have thousands of people flocking to the vast Central Park lawn, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event’s real goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to fight poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless one is willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a variety of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, taking a phone call, or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to get people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – that people feel they are making a big contribution by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters since 2011, with a wealth of different goals.
They say these actions have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was able to cite 390 engagements and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised.
The group estimates that the secured funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the UK to “help children unlock their full potential,” pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the UK to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy as ‘blockade’ to block Russian energy exports
Washington can “if necessary” resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially when operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate on energy just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States, through the Navy, has the ability to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that the energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit that profiles itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, noting that they are far from the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as “one trick pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a tour to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the far cheapest option for European consumers.
Employees in the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Northern European Gas Pipeline 2 project that, according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of fraudulent competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their supplier,” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has met with opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, BDI, has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have major problems with third states interfering with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the head of the BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will ‘Think Seriously’ About Her 2020 Presidential Candidate, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would “rethink seriously” whether she would run for president after the midterm elections.
At a rally in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would run.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix the shaky government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider whether I should run for president.”
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the rally, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m concerned to the very margins about what Donald Trump is doing to democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
58% of “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator shouldn’t run, according to a poll from the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported her candidacy.
The poll showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% supporting a possible candidacy and 48% opposing it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin’s PTSD at Trump’s poll
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after enlisting in Sept.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after returning home, I have in common with other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability our soldiers have,” she told the audience at an event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans: "They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home wondering if this is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, messing up a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while intoxicated, according to Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 states and D.C. support trial of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal trial of a new policy in the United States that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or home violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented a briefing from the amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal police has not been made public.
She claimed that her partner “and his violent gang member sons” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision in 2014 by the Court of Appeal for Immigrants that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that the new policy “disregards many decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be determined on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle,” said the briefing from amicus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the briefing that the policies that denied immigrants access harm the U.S. economy, saying that they are highly likely to become entrepreneurs and “contribute with the necessary manpower.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems — even all the serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu – death toll doubles in search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation worsened.
“It was very excited,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforts her feverish son at an evacuation center in the collapsed city of Palu.
“All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents could be seen coming to ruined homes and searching through water-damaged belongings in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were damaged in the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, are sitting outside the Palus military hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to ongoing heavy aftershocks.
He gets tears in his eyes when he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed by the wall that collapsed, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘harassment’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper that painted the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the appendix China Daily paid to move into the Des Moines Register – the top-selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, a accusation China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the US elections marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, US officials said.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has resulted in rounds of new tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s tariffs early in the trade war were to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
In a reader post in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote: “China is now stepping up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the freedom of speech and the open press that we enjoy in America to put a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing, you won’t find many dissenting opinions and you won’t get to experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese people about China’s problematic economic course, given that the media are under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s largest newspapers declined the offer to publish” his article, although he did not disclose which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female voters before midterm elections with Kavanaugh fade, analysts warn
As many top Republican politicians support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has faced multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will have a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The sentiment around this has been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Arizona) proposal for an FBI investigation at the last second will be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget yesterday’s events – they are not going to forget tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the MoveOn Progressive Group.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November is coming!” while demonstrating in the hallways of the Senate when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
“People say it’s already been high, it’s true.
But it could have been higher, especially among female insecure voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote even if they dislike the president.”
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts believed there would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans forced through the appointment.
“This has become a blissful mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or final approval or whether Kavanaugh will be inaugurated – it’s also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group promoting the election of Democratic candidates, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe in in the wake of Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A recent YouGov survey found that 41% of respondents were fully or fairly convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were fully or fairly convinced of Kavanaugh’s statement.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
The FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly molested her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitals to her while they were at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is “world dominance.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data warehouse online” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, work lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the online personal data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who should have access to that kind of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide the resources, process and relevant expertise to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers to work on the project, and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren’t talking to Facebook and Google about introducing something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely recalculate overnight.
“We are not asking for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new grid built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross recipient from World War I
The only priest in the Church of England to be awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Vann was awarded the honor on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said there was a “great symbolism” in the stone being uncovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning feat.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29 – “through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and led the line "with great courage" forward before storming a field gun with his own hand and knocking out three of the detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said he “feel very honored to play a part in the parade,” adding: “The bravery of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people.”
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 martial arts show, instead they got Peppa pig
Imagine you’ve stayed awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, only to discover you won’t get to see the main game.
The San Jose contestant made it through 13 games, including six on the mainboard and was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the viewers in Britain were sitting to smear when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to watch the game.
A follower on Twitter described the move to the children’s program as “a kind of sick joke.”
“There’s government regulation that it’s not appropriate to broadcast such programs at 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes!".
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, said they will be working on the broadcast schedule to include viewers in the UK in the future.
“I think we can figure it out for the rematch,” Coker said.
“But it is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we will not be able to resolve this until Sunday our time, Monday your time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me - when we passed over, there were a lot of messages going back and forth, and they weren't exactly the friendly sort.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't that, it was a government thing.
I promise you, this won't happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five games – which we usually broadcast – and we tried to go far for the fans, but tipped over.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feeling Inferior to Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority towards everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn’t until high school that he realized he was “not like the others.”
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the rights of the gays to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the traditional program, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
Daley appeared a little lost on Laverne’s first broadcast, saying he felt “less worthwhile” than anyone else he grew up with because “it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls.”
He said, “To this day, it is these feelings of inferiority and differentness that have been the real motivation and have me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time bronze winner at the Olympics and has become a high-profile LGBT ambassador. He used his attendance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he stands up because he feels lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 – “surprised me.”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age” – he attended his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had been changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was all about me winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was if they had bought tickets for London 2012 – since he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” he said.
“I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of a home audience at the Olympics, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – which meant a lot to him in the run-up to the Olympics and still gives him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson selected for the Ryder Cup golf tournament on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to get fit if it’s not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for the impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday’s fourball and foursome games.
Rather than being in the center of events, as he had so often been for the United States, the five-time major winner divides the day between being a cheerleader and working on his game on the rank in hopes of correcting what scrambles.
The 48-year-old never had the best swing, even at the peak of his career and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough area constantly penalizes misguided punches.
And if the pitch itself is not frightening enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 singles games, get off to a successful start, Mickelson’s game could turn out to be crucial.
Furyk expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could have said otherwise.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has contributed so much to these teams earlier and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I envisioned more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible value to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty and likes to make fun of others. He’s a great guy to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun trying their hand at him this week, too, and it was fun to see.
He gives much more than just the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows his great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant lead at the start of the last-day singles game of the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where one side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but scored the win by the smallest possible margin, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only barely,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, photographed after watching Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on that team that this is not over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have got the points on the board.
“We have one goal and that is to try to win this trophy and that’s where the focus is.
I’ve always said that I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re very aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn is very pleased with how his players have managed on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t have done better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, the individual achievements are at the centre, and that’s something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, your performance as a golfer is tested to the fullest.
It’s the message that you need to convey to the players, that they need to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must also go out and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, opponent Jim Furyk will try to get his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the major upheavals of the last day. He was part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe performed the "miracle of Medina".
I remember every damned word of it,” he said in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had ravaged his players at the entrance to the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get off to a good start, like the one we saw at Brookline, like we saw at Medinah.
When momentum starts to move in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We arrange our setup accordingly and send the people out the way we feel. You know, we’re trying to create something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the game and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the player order.
“I’m betting on this group of men in that order because I think it stands the way,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship delayed once again
The German Navy’s newest frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but that will not happen until at the earliest next year due to failing systems and galloping costs, local media reported.
The completion of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the master ship of the brand-new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesperson.
The vessel should have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery pursued the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class Navy ordered back in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It has been agreed that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from the home port.
Continuous delays mean, however, that the advanced warships – they were said to give Germany strength at sea – will already be outdated by the time they are put into service, Die Zeit reports.
The fateful F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship unusable in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half the crew of older frigates of the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has a huge overweight, which reduces performance and limits the navy's ability to make upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-ton heavy "Rhineland-Palatinate" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag of the entire project – including crew training – has also started to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros – from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German government’s defence committee, confirmed that the navy is in fact “going out of useful ships.”
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships were decommissioned, but no new vessels arrived.
He regrets that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the navy.
The National Trust eavesdrop on the secret life of bats
New research conducted at a farm in the Scottish Highlands will reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
There is hope that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help design future conservation measures.
The study by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brown lanchers and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile investigations using handheld detectors.
Experts’ sound analyses of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and which species do what.
A habitat map and a report will then be prepared to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will be included in the decision on what measures to implement, for example, to plant pasture and how best to take care of the forest for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affect breeding sites and the reduction of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to locate insects and obstacles on their way as they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly carry out surveys, surveys of breeding sites and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only own bat reserve at Three Land Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave we have the perfect area for bats,” he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of mapping the bats before carrying out maintenance on a property, since the inadvertent destruction of a single breeding ground can kill up to 400 females and young, and perhaps wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them, or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish co-worker for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help in the work.
She says: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species, we simply don’t know how the populations are doing.”
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against him as “fake news” and says that people “want fame” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is accused of paying her $375,000 afterwards to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo dismissed the allegations as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news,” the five-time winner of the Golden Ball says to the camera.
“They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by giving my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and I’m fine,” the football player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called “an unacceptable portrayal of suspicions in the private sphere,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would demand compensation for "reputational damages to an extent equal to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of privacy in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was “99% a good person” who was betrayed by the “one percent.”
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and photos of her injuries were taken in hospitals, but later they settled outside the court because she was “terrified of revenge” and also worried about “being publicly hanged.”
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to set aside the settlement because she is still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of transferring from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault, moving this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will grieve forever' over losing automakers
The UK “will grieve forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that the consequences of delayed border crossing in the event of a no-deal Brexit could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, I believe we will see production at our plant stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other British manufacturers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says it will close the Mini plant at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern revolves around what automakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is operated on a “order-on-demand” basis and parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a stay at the border, which the industry says could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day of stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production will stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s Brexit plan for further ties with the EU is “precisely geared to avoid such border controls.”
“We need to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy success at the moment, but to seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The message, not only from Toyota but also from other automakers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production will be halted, but warned that increased costs in the long term will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union leader at the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: “My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.”
A government spokesperson said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s fateful meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed another week” as the fight around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, relations between Trump aides and Russia, and possible prevention of law enforcement by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will dismiss the Deputy Attorney General, thus threatening Mueller’s independence, has been fueling speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of recording talks with Trump and attempting to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was about to resign voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations in New York, would take place Thursday.
Trump said he would “preferably avoid” firing Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, further postponing a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I figured it could be a week’s delay because of everything that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I’m always keen to keep the press updated.”
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders hasn’t held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Program host Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to a reluctance to TV reporters’ “self-sufficiency,” although she added, “I don’t disagree with the fact that they are self-sufficient.”
She then suggested that contacts between Trump and the press will become more frequent.
“The president makes more rounds of questions than any previous president,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, and you’ve seen that we’ve done it often in the last few weeks, and it’s going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences at visits of important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, as he undertook a solo race and at times had a strange behavior in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland regarding Brexit concerns
The health secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and a wish that they stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have taken place throughout the summer and are expected to land on a solution this fall.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate now how much I value the efforts of every individual employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of healthcare services for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in Tennessean newspaper.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first half was over.
“He came out on the sidelines and kind of just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before placing him on a stretcher and taking him behind for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/amplitude of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before finishing the game, giving a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters
The document tax increase will be collected from those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Treasury experts expect it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the UK – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young voters with the promise of offering more affordable housing and targeting high-income groups.
The document tax increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will strengthen the government’s efforts to alleviate the situation of the homeless.
The surplus – which comes in addition to the current document fee, including the higher tariff that was introduced two years ago on second home and property purchase for rental – can be as much as 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get their foot in the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country—especially in the capital—have become “ghost cities” because of the many foreign buyers who mostly reside outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in document fees to help more young people own their own home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping house prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May reject allowances on affordable housing to resolve Britain’s “shameful housing policy.”
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a startling series of proposed housing reforms, including rental checks and an end to unwarranted eviction.
He also wants to give the municipal councils more power to build new homes.
May said, “Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream – that life should be better with each new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be as easy for non-UK residents, and also foreign-based companies, to buy homes as it is for hard-working British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become far too distant, and the unworthy situation of the homeless persists.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to become Scotland’s manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old Scotsman welcomes the challenge of reviving the club in the Northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I got a B-cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there’s always something that pulls me back.
However, that opportunity would only come if I succeeded in the management of the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously declined advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured by whether I can get the club back into the Premier League."
From the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League,” he said.
It’s not an easy task to get it there, but I would probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a term as Assistant Chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month brief appearance on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division and helped St Mirren from the brink of relegation to win the championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, created me a reasonable income from it and experienced some nice highlights.
But football can be tough.
There are a lot of things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I’m going through it in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management feels just right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable thing I’ve ever known in my entire adult life.”

Perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, survey shows
This summer’s heatwave has boosted revenues for Britain’s hard-pressed pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7% increase in sales in July – while restaurant revenue fell 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA, who summarized the figures, said: “Still sunshine and England’s unexpectedly long participation in the World Cup made July follow a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs went up 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The drop of 1.8% in restaurant sales in June only got worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had by far the best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than what restaurants went down.
Pubs with food service also had a hard time with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the rastaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6.6% that month, with food serving declining by 3%.”
Paul Newman, RSM analyst, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather and major sporting and social events are still the most important factors in terms of revenue in the outdoor market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups are still struggling, and a revenue drop of 4.8% year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressure.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some are only 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 middle school students uncovered pages of “fake Insta.”
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being shared.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they show their parents.
One in five children – some are just 11 years old – create accounts on social media that they keep hidden from the adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to Instagram photo-sharing sites.
The news has raised concerns that sexual content is being shared.
20% of students said they had an innocent “main account” that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ Conference (HMC) for private schools, revealed that 40% of 11- to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC CEO Mike Buchanan said: “It’s frightening that so many young people are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated track athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those leading the sport to gain insight into her extensive international experience over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide athletics community and we are confident that athletes in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to serve as a voice for track and field athletes and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and has a total of four Olympic gold medals. She is now a regular BBC expert, and after she suffered a transient ischemic attack she was unable to walk.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I want to recover and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’m completely well again and have learned to walk again, and today I’m doing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows splits online public opinion
A breast pump company has split online public opinion with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump worn tightly against the body,” Elvie, the technology-based consumer goods company, released a fresh and flirtatious music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to a song that reads, “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see any tail” and “In case you didn’t realize, this isn’t udder, it’s my boobs.”
The choir continues, “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bowls.”
However, the ad, which is published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it paints the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth.”

Another commented: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: “What an unsuccessful ad.”
Others defend the ad, and one woman admitted that she finds the song “incredibly funny.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“This is a great product,” one wrote.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits nicely in a nursing bra, allowing women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even walk out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all the challenges, while at the same time showing in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible feeling of freedom the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved to a Tent Camp on Texas Border in Secret
The number of migrant children arrested has gone up, even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters have themselves been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by stepping forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household would have to file fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of individuals who applied to be supporters of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
Nearly 80% of people who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to pursue these people,” Albence says.
The police are trying to deal with the children faster and introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within one month of being arrested, and not 60 days as was the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be portrayed via videoconferencing instead of appearing in person to bring their case for a residence permit to an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports that have emerged in the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who are struggling more easily are overlooked because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can amplify trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria Calls on US, French and Turkish 'Occupying Powers' to Withdraw Immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces were staying illegally on Syrian soil under the guise of fighting terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is virtually over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions are displaced.
He said Damascus will continue “to wage this sacred struggle until we have cleared all Syrian territories” of both terrorist groups and “all foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said that conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused “certain Western countries” of “spreading irrational flight” that keeps the refugees away.
“We have approached the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They are politicizing what is really a purely humanitarian situation.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the rebels' last major defensive position at Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who will “be annihilated.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes he can soon convene the first meetings of a new committee of state and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for new elections.
Moualem put forward conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the committee, saying that the panel’s work should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Wants to Win Another Period
By that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, impeachment and scandal put an end to the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic ending of a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of viewing fatigue.
Since 2014, Broadcasting Time has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the cable viewership with a whopping 3.5 million viewers on nights of major news stories.
“This is a fire that attracts people because we don’t understand anything,” said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an acclaimed comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
There is an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course – unlike anything else on TV – the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Withdrawal is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go a long way to being an enlightened human being when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of “dip into background material” for the book Fear, Paul Manafort’s leather jacket with ostrich feathers worth $15,000 (“a garment full of hubris,” said the Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels’ color.
I don’t want to watch Super Mario anymore.
“One of the things he does that makes it look like a reality show is he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the Trump show’s varying cast and daily twist on the plot.
You can't miss one episode, or you'll be lagging behind.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 27°C and sunshine outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he caged himself in and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get loose, not when Brett Kavanaugh is due to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court of the United States is at stake.
“I remember when we made all those crazy shows in the old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the smoothest midterm elections of the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district is experiencing a flood of money after a rescheduling of a congressional district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly-drawn suburban district in Pittsburg runs with Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a by-election last spring.
Lamb runs against another incumbent representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The map was re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were an unconstitutional manipulation of constituencies in favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign funding between the largest party funding groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely followed by by-election for Pennsylvania’s 18th district to Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small lead.
U.S. Considered Penalties Against El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Withdrew Threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the leadership team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to recall U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” ministry spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and financial aid.
The proposed punitive measures, which included cuts in economic aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials postponed a top-level conference focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
However, by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, halting any plans for punitive measures against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, the diplomat said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned calmly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next nail in the coffin may be Special Adviser Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is allegedly also expanding the investigation into whether Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in interfering in our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held accountable in that body, in the midst of preparations to meet the electorate again and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not mean to claim that Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
There must be choices made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the bloodbaths that followed.
The course of history revolves around such tipping points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or hampered.
Americans are facing several of these tipping points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in rough weather ever since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret wiretaps of the president and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says the Times' presentation is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the recently initiated FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair — or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite credible abuse charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote during the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we don’t pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, because of the experience I gained in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not look optimistic about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of meeting with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard to achieve bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game and thought we could do something and got a point.
Maybe we could have nodded in at the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday is going to be a big night in Europe.
We are hoping for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home crowd in their backs, I am sure we can stand by and get a positive result.
"Last year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the replacements at the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying themselves; the training is good.
Hopefully we can get on with it now, put last season behind us and make it happen.”
Women lose their night’s sleep due to fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to the family about it.
Around half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to their kids about it.
“People want to be taken care of by someone in their family, but they’re doing nothing to take that call,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
This is how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for nursing if you don’t say what you want well in advance.
Discuss with the counselor and the family where and how the care should be given. Such choices can be of great importance in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover those expenses, or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Clear out legal issues right away.
Get a health attorney in place by appointing a person you trust to oversee your medical care, and making sure that health care professionals will comply with your wishes should you be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving someone power of attorney over your finances.
You choose a trustworthy person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your old parents are having a medical emergency and are on their way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down the details in an overview so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.

Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he was on his way home after a night out.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. BST, as an “unmotivated act.”
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Communications are out of order, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative region below the provincial level, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the central province of Sulawesi's economy, particularly the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian relief administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that razed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as humans were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused several thousand tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, messing up a report on domestic violence and opposing arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged abuse.
Palin is being detained in Mat-Su custody and is being arrested for an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He was brought to court Saturday, pleading “not guilty, absolutely” when asked how he stood on the guilt question, the network reported.
Palin is confronted with three Class A offenses, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with class B misconduct, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to report the alleged assault.
The case will be heard in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, clashes with the report on domestic violence, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: several hundred killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and death tolls are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the outbreak.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people – a rare sentence not exercised in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he beat down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intentionally” and caused serious bodily harm intentionally, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for the possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury slammed the 22-point indictment, including eight charges of extortion-related murder in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and vehicle wrecking.
The attack required “significant planning and intent,” the prosecutor said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as “horrible, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, property creation and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a case that could result in the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to conduct espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his mobile, according to the charges.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the people’s army” today during a demonstration during the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should “feel the pressure” from Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested that he be given responsibility for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain “would have been eradicated” by now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been underscored by the pro-Remain Tories who participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she will move forward in trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite the setback – forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos.”
Bone told the Solihull protesters that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we would be out now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added, “I will stand up for Brexit, but we must reject the Brexit plan.”
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration and told reporters: “I’m simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unpopular with the general public. The opposition is not going to vote for it. It is unpopular in the party and among our activists, who are actually the ones who are trotting the streets and getting us elected in the first place.
“Reject the Brexit plan and start listening.”
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians would “feel the pressure” if they thought about betraying the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now about trust between us – the people – and those politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to let them know they won’t get away with it.”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before having a two-hour political rally in the city centre.
A small crowd of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security concerns they had with a party app at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren seriously considers running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts talked about the future during a town hall meeting in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who served as vice chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been central to speculation that she will run against Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors, who have been using the city hall format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to come to Washington to fix our faulty government, and that includes a woman at the top.”
Arrest After LSU Sims Killed in Shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying a man who was seen on the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the scene with a gun, and he admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a two-metre-tall youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims for world championship after team order gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stable order would play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got off to a good start, sweeping Hamilton out of the field as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and allowed Hamilton to continue driving in the rear of the main lane, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove himself up after some pushing with the wheels that reluctantly allowed the Ferrari driver to leave the inside free after a double pass to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in seventh at the end of his first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race while lying on the wheels to try to get a quick finish and overpower Kimi Raikkonen who was fourth.
He eventually reached the depot in the 44th round, but was unable to speed up the remaining eight rounds and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It’s a difficult day because Valtteri did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me through.
The team has done a fabulous job of getting a good two-team team,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at an event in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are “malicious, awful, and speaking falsely.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you experience anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and awful and speak falsely,” he said.
“When you look at extraditions and leaks, and they say, ‘Oh, I haven’t done that.
I haven’t done it.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
You remember her answer... you leaked the document—“Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I haven’t leaked.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked ... no, we didn’t leak,” he added, imitating the Senator’s vote.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked.”
But her denial was not graciously addressed by the president, who commented at the party event on Saturday night: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president hinted that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power by all necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got a two-goal lead early on via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised for the home team before Dwyer restored the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come behind after defeating Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford retired when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added up to Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants were in the lead at the break when he took his second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard equalized once again with a masterful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half, and he secured the victory with the team's five in the half of the round.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of air passengers escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as the hero after he died and ensured that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after his colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the strongly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts broke when we heard it,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll may reach thousands, and the country's disaster response agency reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The numbers are expected to rise further as many bodies are still trapped under the rubble and many have not been reachable," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Up to six meters high waves have razed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is working frantically to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says man is missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that one man is missing, and they previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that by Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not know.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just off the runway.
Witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a pier were also helping in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters below the surface.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered aircraft in the past twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst sets out the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors ended the procedure Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to puzzle the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he was collecting location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to what he had claimed earlier, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers' cell phone during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness stand on Saturday, claiming he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in the trailer for Sanford that night, Sanford said he was “lying because my trailer was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile transcripts suggest that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said a little after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted calls, contact details, and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
“He deleted her from her life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Community-Engaged Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that hip hop has moved from its origins with political messages to addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make community-engaged hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a new resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York babysitter sues couple for dismissal after “racist” report
A New York babysitter is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother, who complained that she was “another black person.”
The couple denied that they were racist, comparing the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up for the first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEII ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the mistake, it was an “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman who fired Maurice, claiming that their fired nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was expecting someone from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demanding compensation of the order of $350 per day for the six-month, lodging-based arrangement she was promised, though without a contract.
“I wanted to show them that—hey, you just don’t do that,” she told the New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have rebuffed the allegations that they are racist and say the dismissal of Maurice was the only right thing, since they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something that she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist,” Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
The comparison of the lawsuit with "extortion" says Plasco was due to his wife having only two months to term and being in a "very difficult situation".
Is that the kind of person you want to punish?
That’s not very nice,” the stockbroker added.
As the legal case progresses, the popular court has swiftly condemned the couple on social media and criticized them for their behavior and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared readers would not accept a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s very funny to know what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children’s book by a little cloth bear, would have been delighted that his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book’s release was “bitterly sweet” after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important family member" and adds that her father was secretly very proud of the success he achieved.
“He was a rather quiet man, and he was not a boastful person,” she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child doing a feat: you’re proud of it even if it’s not really your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
Upon landing, her daughter had been rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say it looked bad, he didn’t think she would survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got the phone call from Nad who said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to make her heart beat slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body collapsed.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t scream because I was surrounded by people.
I really had to pull myself together.”
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the trials she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I looked down all the time and tears flowed in a steady stream.
It’s hard to explain, but it was there on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards with grieving women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Sharon’s son Tyler was 13 years old when he suffered from depression and took his own life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to relive every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him on his smile.
They said his smile could light up any room.”
He quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was one of the people who found him after he took his own life.
Sharon says, “I’m constantly worried there’s going to be an infectious effect.”
Sharon made the cards “to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit to yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, his partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he was feeling down or depressed or anything,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed the changed mood.
On Christmas Day he was all the way in the basement – when the kids opened the Christmas presents, they didn’t make eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a major trauma to them, but they have to fight their way through it: “It tears up a big hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
We all have to stand up and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs by a thread as FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get some of what he asked for – a time and scope-limited scrutiny – maybe we could come to some agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would “disintegrate” along locked party boundaries.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, November 6 – if the Republicans are supposedly doing badly, it will be considerably more difficult for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators and lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was a personal secretary for Bush.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to use his double vote and get him installed on the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors "fall" under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislature said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea’s Ministry of Unification, said there had been 1,127 defections last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices for human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented on this publicly.
Most defectors from North Korea are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China considers the defectors to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and returns them by force.
North-South relations – which are technically still at war – have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks about the deadlocked negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for failure to make progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions there is no possibility that we will unilaterally disarm first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh 'Hysterical' and Says He's Unfit to Sit on Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statements in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved that way, she would be called hysterical,” Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied having sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost screaming and crying when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated character killing” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony shows he can’t sit on the Supreme Court since it shows he is biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House.
“I want to say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he’s not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court, but in the court he sits on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In the questioning, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would override certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
There is a righteous indignation, months and years in which the anger takes over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s weird, do you?”
She continues: “I got good help from a woman who was my supervisor somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And I thought it was wonderful.”
Tears are allowed as an outlet for resentment in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories from one of my first jobs was in a male-dominated office. I started crying with unexplained rage and was grabbed by the neck collar of an older woman – a cool boss that I had always been a little afraid of – who dragged me to a stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sorry and be happy because they managed to get you.”
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he ran for president.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be cheating on his spouse aboard a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought there was nothing wrong with investigating the possibility of running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was one more.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
As it was nearing the end of the campaign, she lagged behind with the funding and swore that she would not run if she did not make $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount, or?” she wonders.
When she delivered her speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions—gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism—that she collapsed in tears.
“You’d think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press reported on her.
“You’d think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I was wondering what they would write on my grave.
"She cried?"
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening ointments of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and although the struggle is far from over, a rift between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, meaning tariffs on half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Beijing has, of course, retaliated every time, most recently with a five to ten percent mark-up on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to match US attacks for attacks, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to raise the white flag at first.
Getting Washington to step down means yielding to demands, but public submission to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the US could provide a positive outcome for China in the long term by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger economic ripple effects in one of the countries is actually far more dangerous than spectators have realized in the past,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than 7 years of war.
Speaking at the UN National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that no conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the insurgency would be accepted.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the team of Danish team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn got the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for much of the tournament, hit his tee in the water at the par-3 16th hole, and had to see himself beaten by Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant in all his rounds and became one of four golfers to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 by the lowest-ranking player on the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup final.
With eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind him, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the tournament's most successful European of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I am very, very happy to get the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m glad I could help,” said Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles play on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely growing up,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career points in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, just beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his squad, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
There were moments this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their team captain.
All you have to do is take your hat off.
We were beaten.”
Update on algae bloom: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Commission on Fisheries and Wildlife (FWC) shows a general decline in red-algae concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, spotted blooms are reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier County – suggesting reduced concentrations.
A bloom of red algae extends about 210 km along the coast, from the north in Pinellas to the south in Lee County.
