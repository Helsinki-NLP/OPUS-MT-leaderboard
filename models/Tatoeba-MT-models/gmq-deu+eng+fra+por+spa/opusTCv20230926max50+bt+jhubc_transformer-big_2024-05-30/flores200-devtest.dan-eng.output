In the PALM trial, ZMapp acted as a control, which means that the researchers used it as a baseline and compared the other three treatments with it.
USA Gymnastics supports the United States Olympic Committee's letter, and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the statement of the USOC that it is in the best interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sports, to move forward with meaningful changes within our organization rather than de-certification.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as the color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown at the top with a light or carrot-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a feather shaft, but have other characteristics from feathers — rays and bee rays — the researchers deduced that feathers were likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
Removed structure suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for decoration. The researchers believed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage and not a chicken's down.
The researchers believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows an adult individual's plumage and not a chicken's down.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and wounding more than twenty other people.

They found that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star in terms of magnetic turns.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be the result of tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on Earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the galaxy SagDEG.
The researchers could conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of lots of small particles.
Television reports show that white smoke is coming from the power plant.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and that there was reason for alarm because of its very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have had the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health professionals.
In one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people who have tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected in South Africa at any given time.

"Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona, said: "Their thermal behavior indicates that they are quite deep holes in the ground, although they do not behave as stablely as large holes on Earth, often keeping a fairly constant temperature throughout the day."
In France, voting is traditionally low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a box and put a preprinted piece of paper, indicating their choice of candidate, in an envelope.
Once officials have verified the voter’s identity, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the polling list.
The procedure is codified very accurately in French electoral law.
Voting urns have been transparent since 1988, so that voters and observers can see that the urns do not contain ballot papers at the start of the vote and that no other ballot papers are added than those that have been correctly counted and come from approved voters.
Candidates can send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Four skiers in the women's group of sitting athletes did not finish the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not rank in the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we found her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver sustained serious injuries to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been accused by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering her son.
She is in custody waiting to be prosecuted and tried, but evidence from eyewitnesses may be flawed because her photo has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently, and the courts have considered the publication of images to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it seems definite that journalists should beware if they publish pictures of suspects, etc."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment is made available.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the borders of before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics covered include the future condition of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the problems surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement has been signed, while the Palestinian authorities agree to leave the valley for only five years.
Shooters in the supplemental pest control trial had to be followed closely by the park rangers as the trial was monitored and its efficacy evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Nature Conservation and Cultural Heritage of the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
A new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) was sworn in yesterday by Martelly.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the former CEP’s resignation was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly’s response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October was the Commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In about 60 reported cases, defective iPods have been overheated, causing a total of six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economic Affairs, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that they had been aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of another 34 cases of overheating, which the company called “non-serious.”
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "quite regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Office announced that no damage had been reported in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Philippine photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady when she was going to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father’s footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He took an education as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began researching early births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the development of the baby’s lungs in the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two “black box” aircraft recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died at night with two moons. Pretty unique, just like herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as me... maybe even more... loves her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place now."
Out of 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those surveyed share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia’s last monarch.
In the poll’s various extremes, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints there have been doubts about his condition.
He could not take the medications necessary to fight his pain, as these are prohibited during the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest known prime number to date.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how Earth was formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political snitch and foolishness".
I wonder if he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older ground-based technology, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transportation is put in and the trains above ground will not stop in Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride options will not be available on the ground.
Fear of lack of transport raised the possibility that you would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos lakes.
Researchers from Princeton University in the US and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species was developed in just two generations, although it had been thought that this process should have taken much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin finch geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finch geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be pulled out into a thin cable, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin and put on other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books, which were called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color, depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH is expressed by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Brinions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system in almost every house,
Remains of sewer systems have been found in houses in the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To put a satellite or telescope in space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster transport methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them are several medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat the far more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of the niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called herds.
The flocks consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion flocks react much like wolves or dogs in flocks, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete who can climb (although not well), swim, jump far and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a phrase of snarling, shouted words.
Ozelots prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) via smells, by sniffing out where they have been on Earth.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move around very quietly. Ozelots hunt their prey by walking in one with their surroundings and then throwing themselves over their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population they came from (such as if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different features or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it would have previously been necessary.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process species formation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the top of the food chain in its day, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape route for anything that crossed its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue; its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
Even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex wouldn't be able to fight it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormer.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have big feasts together, where they lay on their side while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, so-called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their lives outdoors.
Women cooked the food in the courtyard; the shops were just open disks facing the street; stones were used to build houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was settled with few people. In the Nordic sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he travelled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discovery,Inuit tribes already lived in the area at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true: even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
Written on the reverse of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" appear at the bottom of the document when it is turned upside down.
Although no one knows with certainty who wrote it, it is known that early in its lifespan the large parchment document (it measures 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inch x 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inch) was rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the remark was enclosed simply as an addition.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was ruled by the French government of Vichy - there are Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, significant group of people living together and cooperating, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; and it also somehow defines the size of society.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. A culture of civilization entails the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-term cultural influence and fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — with Congress as the sole component — under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, they depended on the state authorities, who were often uncooperative in enforcing all acts.
It also had no right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
Taiwan’s history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by named it Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan that started a change in the original grain production practices, and hired Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty troops (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Peace of Shimonoseki Treaty, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, who ruled over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Window.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been re-established, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world for still images is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the era of analog films.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, which may seem confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (such as APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The highly abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism and at the same time keeps a certain order in a picture.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become prosperous and influential, was examined.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united European countries in spite of different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from king to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that prosperity should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s financial resources are used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this dogma was properly lived up to.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching. This blockade was contrary to the recognized international laws codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, endangering even neutral ships.
As there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitudes of most citizens and nations leaned toward pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were shown in a unique way; each Chinese time period or each family in power was a separate dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces, the most notable of which was the era of three kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasty.
During these periods there was a fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China's history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle to sit in the highest seat of the Great Palace in Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed well.
The same goes for the military, because instead of class-based ranking in the army, the ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in relationships beyond secular life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it’s not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. When you’re inside the cave, it’s a total isolation.
Only the clear beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-arc" mark looks like a V and the "down-arc" mark looks like a staple, or a square that lacks its bottom side.
Up means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Upstroke usually produces a softer sound, while downstroke sounds louder and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the inscribed arch markings are determined for musical reasons, which is why they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a pack of market women.
They travelled back to Paris in a wagon surrounded by a screaming group of people who shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their chariot completely open.
At one point, a member of the mob showed the head of a royal guard who was killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the American colonial power to raise money for the bulk of the expenses, and bond yields ran through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the superprofits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context in which the order was founded.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that took place in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the early Middle Ages, which was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice ranging from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that relates to scientific laws and the way they translate into technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an "impact" on societies that are hereditary and not socially contingent.
For example, one can say that the motorized car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
When many people own cars, there are also more accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new techniques in the field of health to heal body injuries.
Romance contained a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romance it was geography that shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures related to geography emerged, and these were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the capital of fashion in the modern world, Constantinople was considered the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
It is known to be an epicenter of luxury since about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that had a greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothing was largely inspired by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is carried out to produce sufficient food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characteristic due to the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that regulate a subculture as being separate may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
People who belong to a subculture often signal their belonging through a clear and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children through failure, misfortune, or willful neglect have not been socialized by adults in their childhood.
Such children are called "wild-living" or savage. Some savage children have been detained by humans (most often their own parents); in some cases, this child failure was caused by the parental rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairments.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in nature on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical boundaries) that is almost identical to the animal that has shown care for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn new things - for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software, and aims to question, ask for, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children come into foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment without nourishment, care and education, yet they do.
We see the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
A foster family has the task of providing all necessities that did not exist in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction approach.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the audience's reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the understanding of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to a brain injury are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities for interpreting human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added via mutation, and it is removed from the pool of exact variations via selection.”
Separation and recombination mixes the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like man to satisfy his need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of non-compliance: slowed growth, malnutrition and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are hard to digest unless they are cooked.
Conversely, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, it also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in much the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep disorder is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find that you turn off the clock while you sleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to stand up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is quite the opposite of the amount of excitement that a person possesses in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can learn to understand. The only thing that stands in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the Mahayana path of love and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divinity yoga ("Deity Yoga"). Through the visualization of various divinities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to a collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the differences in the countries' system, process and culture led to the countries opposing each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought in earnest by deputy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, became obsolete almost overnight, as over 800,000 Red Army soldiers of the Soviet Union entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the carriage of goods is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of both people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy’s mission has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and your goods, while affecting your enemy’s ability to move his people and his goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain like the rest of Europe.
As far as is known, goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures, often supervised by goat shepherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more commonly known shepherds.
As early as the 16th century, carriageways were built in England.
Although the carriages consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly more uneven roads of the day.
Sleeves were invented quite early to keep the tracks in place, but gradually it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails were used, which were made entirely of metal.
The first known method of transportation was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning erect man).
Their predecessor Australopithecus did not usually walk upright.
There are two-legged specializations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2–3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases just like treating symptoms. But if we don’t want just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and man’s extravagant lifestyle.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by the President of Congress John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was carried out by John Nixon on July 8 at Independence Hall's courtyard.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9, he had it read to his soldiers in New York. On August 10, a copy arrived in London.
The 25 Dunlap sheets still in existence are the oldest surviving version of the document; the original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live. We call them birds.
Most people don’t see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have feet with dandruff and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, e. g. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits, to use computer language.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general for a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This term derives from ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that largely live as parasites on humans.
Both rodents and bedbugs are nidikolous, meaning they are adapted to live in their host’s house or nest.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not best for them or their child that they have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over them.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific studies.
However, it does not stand alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to remove one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also leads to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and the natural biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living beings such as bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape as well as plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird observation and visits to parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Where morning people leave small villages by car to go to their place of work, and are passed by others whose places of work are the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
The decarbonized economy has detached the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years, according to science now.
Everyone is a part of society and uses the transport systems; almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) current, (2) density and (3) speed.
These factors help in planning, designing and operating road construction.
Insects were the first animals to fly; their ability to fly helped them to more easily dodge enemies and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings in along the body.
This gives them a greater variety of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the jeweler and the jewel fly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
There were differing opinions about his theory - some believed that he was right, while many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
That makes sense, because we can't feel the earth spinning, can we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on earth, containing more than eight times as much water as the world’s second-largest river.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, and is in some places up to six miles (about 9.6 km) wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows through the planet’s rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long.
Although the pyramid building with stones continued until the end of the ancient kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical expertise.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, who at that time were well over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800, the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language spoken by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig for if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: Earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basic mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many substances in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You may also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period that ends this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to most people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost status and is being used less since new writing methods have emerged.
People now write messages through computer screens and never have to get near a pencil sharpener.
One can only guess what will become of the keyboard when something new comes up.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Kind of like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill. When the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break down under little or no impact.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It is thinner beneath the maria and thicker beneath the highlands.
There may be more lunar gardens on the front, as the crust here is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on finding out what makes people react or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have become internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
The theories examine what it is about certain people that causes them to perform certain actions, and what elements in their environment cause them to perform or refrain from performing certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the needs pyramid, and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can occur when a manager begins to lead his former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has accomplished and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team’s successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have the same expectations for expertise as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team that each member reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of translating organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity begin to show when all available resources are used effectively across an organization’s functional departments.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer’s needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leaders must create a culture that fosters innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows down the field of research and makes it much more accurate.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes like we have never seen before.
This gives us lots of information and materials to build simulation models with which to help us understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI includes being able to manufacture machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, scheduling and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwritten recognition, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military business sectors, as it has been built into numerous home computers and computer game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of any class. Quite often a teacher would love to take his students to places where it is not possible to travel by bus.
The technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum objects, visit aquariums or admire beautiful artworks while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a good method of evaluating an excursion and sharing experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is rebuilt, but old versions still exist online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students’ writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve in writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, "blogging forces students to become smarter about the world around them." The requirement to give the audience what they want inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by providing active response to internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written as well as describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming, bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and other areas.
All of these things as well as more highlights Ontario as what is considered genuinely Canadian by outsiders.
Further north, there are large areas that are rather sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent by itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are connected to France and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly became widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the discovery by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama of the Cape route between Europe and India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It makes sense to wear what might look like a wedding ring (it just shouldn’t look too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don’t be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it’s not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tagins, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a wide range of nips, but it is very touristy.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo and is located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Despite the fact that Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the fighting taking place in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano and one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boa-boda (motorcycle-taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is <0x7E>500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Along with the relative inaccessibility of the city, it has made Timbuktu a metaphor for exotic, distant regions.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the country’s cities because it has a more Arab flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and admission fees to the park.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, as this either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa’s national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and is the place that many tourists consider as the primary focus area.
The Hong Kong skyline is a group of buildings that are often compared to a glittering bar chart by their reflection in the water of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon port front on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong’s urban development is tightly packed on recovered land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, so if you’re looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast into Bangladesh and India’s hinterland.
Sundarbans has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps — they include some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forests that once covered the Gandhi plain.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water/moorlands.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengali royal tigers and about 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses run from the interregional bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day although most, especially those going to the east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and robust.
Delete taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable bridge that stretches over the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011. It opened for traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs control posts are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important group of natives living in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also cultivated agriculture to survive.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurús and Payaguas, who survived by hunting, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the Great Province of India, was born in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams in the world and some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polobans in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets, please contact Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), the value of which is set at the value of a British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be used, although UK and US currencies may be used; ask the owners in advance to know which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland’s currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months it is normal to have temperatures above 30°C.
Winter can be misleadingly cool: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what is on the thermometer.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must be at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bisons, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals can well attack.
Every year, a lot of visitors get hurt because they do not keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and can be dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the setting for a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for a British cruise ship, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, which was organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful rally in the city that resulted in the assassination of Supreme Commander Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two ports. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most get natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata harbour in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea. It is safe to swim here.
The most widely used local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better to transport.
It’s completely safe to drink the local tap water, but it’s easy to find bottled water if you’re worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is alien. A "short black" is called "espresso", cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but in turn excellent.
Many people visit the reef all year round, and people rarely get hurt on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to advice from the authorities, read and follow advice on signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea wasps occur near beaches and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and want to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active life in the ocean, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance reservation gives the traveler peace of mind that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals on specific hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other forms of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or provide other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should be made to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of participants in music festivals choose to camp on site, and many participants consider it a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to be where it’s going, you have to get in early to get a tent pitch close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the big stages is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music until late in the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
Check where your cabin is if you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through ice can be quite noisy for those closest to you.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions), which is nice to know as cruises to Saint Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually not present, and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers for food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them in the house.
In some places, alcoholic drinks are offered at the expense of the house, but drunkenness weakens judgment, and all real gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who needs to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice and freezing temperatures.
On ice and snowy roads, there is low friction and you can’t drive on dry asphalt as you normally would.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snow falling or blowing, or by condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, and traffic glides mostly undisturbed all year round.
Safaris are the highlight for many and may be what attracts the vast majority of tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land trips to see the stunning African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach cars, so standard equipment is enough to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can better see them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walk-safari" or "safari on foot") consists of hikes that either take a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may run into problems.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets to the event will cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, with typical tickets costing around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry it. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow even if there is no one in the room.
If you don’t have the option to use an iron, or if you don’t like wearing socks that are ironed, try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful not to let the substance get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases burns).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they do not know from home.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill humans, are usually not perceived as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and duties.
Travelers who are heading to countries with a high tax rate can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through isolated terrain in the hinterland.
Be alert if you’re not used to driving on the road: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp corners are plentiful.
The set speed limits are remarkably lower than on routes before and after — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is even more important than normal to adhere to them accurately.
Strangely enough, coverage on mobile phones is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very tasty and varied, just like in Germany's southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baked goods are common: apples are baked in cakes year-round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand
If you fancy some small but full-bodied cakes, you can try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.

Ladders are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause safety problems due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but has a foot trapped in the stirrup, he or she may be pulled along if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, you can take some precautions.
First, many riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars, which cause the stirrup straps to be detached from the saddle if they are pulled backwards by a falling rider.

Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve driving down snowy terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a great travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ski sums", who plan the whole holiday around skiing in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to the year 5,000 BC show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, skiing or skiing.
It is related to, but usually does not involve alpine style skiing or mountaineering. The latter is carried out in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You should see the ski route as if it were a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly larger distances than if you walk – but it is only very rare that you get the same speed as on cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries: in normal circumstances, crossing several countries would mean having to review visa applications and passport controls several times.
In this context, however, the Schengen area operates roughly as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to pass through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be smaller in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture around it is also important for many Sami with other industries.

The current from waves returning and breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar, is called a countercurrent.
Due to the subsea topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow into deep water can be formed.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue by trying to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the stream, it’s no harder than normal to swim back.

Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where an active volcano’s flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbour area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the peninsula's mountains meet on the plateau and form the Ellsworth Mountains' 360 km long chain, which is divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range holds the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), which peaks at 4,892 m.

On some routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent things by air cargo, on some routes it may have taken days to get through unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through faster was by sending it as checked baggage. The airline rules do not allow them to send baggage without a passenger. That is where you come into the picture.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to put a big pile of money in front of getting the opportunity (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the economy class standard price for business class and eleven times the price for first class!
