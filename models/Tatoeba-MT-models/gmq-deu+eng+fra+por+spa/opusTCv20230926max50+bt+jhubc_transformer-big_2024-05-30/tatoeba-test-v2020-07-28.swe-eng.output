I hate to be late.
No, you can't use my car!
I know you're busy.
I'm gonna be alone.
What's it worth?

Welcome to us!
It wasn't great.
Easily captured, easily lost.
Has everyone found their mistakes?
Where does your uncle live?
The house was quiet.
I let my feelings obscure my judgment.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
People are sitting on the grass.
I heard a South American camper was eaten by an anaconda.
She felt that we were too different.
They look so happy.
The lake had frozen, so we crossed the ice.
Why doesn't Tom ever say hello to us anymore?
That's actually a good point.
Who said I stole the money?
They were vulnerable.
When was this temple built?
You don't care?
This paper does not absorb ink.
My knee hurts when I bend it.
None of this is real.
I lost everything I had.
We gotta go right now.
Tom glanced downwards.
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm responsible for his behavior.
Tom is scared.
I got a reading pad for Christmas.
She plays hockey on the weekends.
You don't talk much.
The red umbrella reminded her of her grandmother.
I remember the first time.
This is a very time-consuming task.
Tom took off his clothes and went into the shower.
The other kids call her Piglet.
It meant a lot to me.
I'm not good at dancing.
I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom teaches.
She has taken on too much work.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a handle.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never get along.
It is unclear whether the letter ever arrived or not.
We haven't done anything.
You dropped your pen.
You're gonna be in bed all day, aren't you?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under barbed wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really gonna do that?
Give this to Tom.
Tom knows it's true.
He was crying.
Can I see Tom today?
Nobody wants that.

You should have seen her.
I need to buy stamps.

Then try it now.
It didn't really affect us.
Did Tom vote?
I walk like a penguin.
Did I forget something?
You're taller than me.
Happy birthday to you.
I don't even want you here.
I love going to new places and seeing new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
Her speech bored me.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do as Tom suggests, unless someone else has a better proposal.
The ice is very thick.
Do you understand?
I can only speak for myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom hit Mary.
You would have liked it.
I've got some more.
I use the computer.
Six were invited, the boy included.
Kate has a cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not angry.
There is no doubt who will be elected.
He got hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep myself motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read The Lord of the Rings trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.
She advocated equality.
What are you looking at?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.
Greetings, Guilde Brother.
Where is the Portuguese Embassy?
My friends didn't betray me during the trial.
Tom shot me in the leg.
I was just teasing you.
Stay down.
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.
We need to talk to you about Tom.
What's the matter with her?
Get dressed quickly.
I took the photo.
I said good morning.
The queue for the test cabins was winding through the shop.
I need an answer.
I hate my computer.
He lost control of the car in the curve.
I hope you find Tom.
Mary works in the city's public library.
We're different.
Get back in the van.
She helped the old man cross the road.
No one is too old to learn.
I would do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks walked into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom cheated on me.
Tom is helping.
One morning he saw a beautiful girl.
This tree is not even close to being the tallest in the parish.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up, hand in your papers.
My father is healthy.
We can save many lives.
If you don't have the money, you'll have to do without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
Helen’s words suddenly filled me with new strength.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're mad.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even my mom knows about it.
He should have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy grabbed the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mosquito bites.
I'm out of work.
This medication will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of someone?
I'd like to talk to Tom for a second.
He will fall into temptation.
The TV's not working.
I can explain that.
She behaves like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but can you at least accept that there are people who have different opinions than you?
Tom put the book down.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you done now?
She could not imagine seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I secretly give in to my internet addiction.
I never thought it would be so hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get down to town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it?
Tom blinked the high beams.
Are you threatening me?
Tom is worried.
I used to like coming here.
This is not a fish.
Tom and Mary may not have done what everyone says they did.
There's no one here named that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come and sit down.
That's gotta be enough.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My chainsaw is broken.
You think she's hot, don't you?
He lived a simple life.
This is gonna take years.
I spelled the word wrong.
I don't like this book.
An octopus has ten arms.
She didn't arrive before two.
I am.
That was very good.
Come and talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
I had never seen such a peaceful sight.
Tom is fast.
About 4.9 per cent of Finns are Swedish, i.e. people with Swedish as their mother tongue.
Tom unfortunately sat down.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'm gonna read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She attached a photo.
The walls of the old house were not straight.
Where is she? Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the steering wheel to the right.
I'm in the attic.
He said he didn’t eat meat.
Did you win?
Everybody's dreaming.
Flour is made with wheat.
How did you get this?
Is that relevant?
You gave it to me.
I knew you'd make sense.
Upon returning home, I discovered the robbery.
The cat has two ears.
Not really.
You don't even like chocolate.
She likes to sing.
Christ is risen!
I need your opinion.
I've had a rough afternoon.
Will you be waiting for us at the station?
I don't see anybody.
The more you get to know her, the more you'll like her.
Give Sami a kiss.
Are they in love with each other?
Which is your favorite fast food restaurant?
Tom won't stay.
I'll do it. I'll do it.
We have to find it.
What's missing?
I can do it myself!
Don't worry about it.
She paid 7% interest on the loan.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to fire you.
Can I think about it?
When did you see Tom?
It's not important!
Strange things happened on her birthday.
Does anyone here speak Russian?
I was driving the car.
I've got some great news.
Are we safe yet?
We tried to contact the other ship.
You're gonna die soon.
This one's not good.
I think you're right.
Monday starts on Sunday.
It is certainly not worth the effort.
"How old are you?" "I'm sixteen."
I have a bladder of steel.
Have you heard from Tom?
We visited historically interesting places.
We're having steak tonight.
Tickets are only valid for two days, including the day they were purchased.
I have two foreign friends.
You might as well tell him in advance.
The number of people who smoke increased in the last decade.
Call the fire department!
I had to make a decision.
You're not helping.
Can I talk to Tom?
