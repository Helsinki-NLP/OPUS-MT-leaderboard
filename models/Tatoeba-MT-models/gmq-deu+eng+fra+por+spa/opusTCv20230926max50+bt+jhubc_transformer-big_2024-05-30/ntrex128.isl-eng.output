Welsh stewards worry about "looking like a fool"
Some members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) have proposed that their title be changed to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
Concerns have arisen as a result of a plan to change the Council’s name to the Welsh Parliament.
stewards of all parties are concerned that this may make them ridiculous.
One Labour steward said his party was concerned that “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers living outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means crazy and pwp means faeces.
A steward of the party, Plaid Cymru, said that the party as a whole was “dissatisfied” and has made other proposals under the name.
A steward from the Welsh Conservative Party said his party had an “open mind” about the name change, but pointed out that there was not much difference between the word MWP and Muppet (floor).
In this context, it can be noted that the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to u in Icelandic.
The Council, which is now working on a bill to propose the name changes, said: “The final decision on all names held by members of the Council will, of course, lie with the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Council published the results of a public opinion poll, which showed great support for calling the Council the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the stewards, the council chose WMP (Welsh Parliament members) but the MWP received the most public support in polls.
According to the news, stewards are now making other proposals, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the chairman of the council, Elin Jones, who is due to submit a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The proposal for the reforms will also include other changes in the way the Council works, including rules on the expulsion of administrators and the organisation of the committee system.
Treasurers will be able to cast a final vote on their title when discussions on the bill begin.
Macedonians vote in elections to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
This case was put to the vote in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with the neighboring country of Greece, which has its own region with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the names of its northern neighbours are equivalent to claims in its territory and has repeatedly objected to their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said he will not consider the election as valid.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, have said that the name change is simply the price that needs to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Church Bells of St. Martin Silence as Churches in Harlem Have Difficulty
“The older people I’ve talked to said that in the past a bar and a church could be found on every corner of the street,” Mr. Adams said.
“None of them can be found here.”
He said it is understandable that bars are decreasing.
“People have other ways to meet,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the centers of the neighborhood where people meet regularly.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money derived from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect “and sooner or later they will be back on the ground.”
He added that it is possible that churches would be replaced by residential buildings that would be full of people who would not help save the remaining refugees in the vicinity.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and as a result will speed up the process of permanent closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of blacks - the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and the St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation moved away in the 1930’s.
A congregation of black people who had worked nearby took over the building.
The congregation of blacks took over the St. Martin’s Church under the guidance of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who took the initiative to bypass the merchants on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who longed to hire black workers or give them promotions.
The building was severely damaged in a fire in 1939, but members of Reverend Johnson's congregation made plans to rebuild it and also had the clockwork constructed.
Pastor David Johnson, son and successor of Pastor Johnson, proudly called the clock game “the clocks of the poor people.”
The expert who played the clock game in July called it another name: “Culture treasure” and “a unique historical instrument.”
Specialist Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the first clock game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to a larger clock game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had no one else in his place.
In recent months, numerous architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by church leaders and others by the diocese.
The Council – which oversees the parish and is appointed by church leaders – wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that the diocese “would seek to pass the cost on” to the Council, even if it had not been involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishopric.
Shark wounds 13-year-old boy who dives after lobster in California
According to authorities, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and wounded him on Saturday as the boy was diving for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack occurred just before seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then rode over with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement to have a lobster, but then “he realized the boy was shouting, ‘I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
All his legs were torn," Hammel said of what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I called out to everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously injured.
It is not known what type of shark attacked the boy.
Coastguard chief Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks before, but he was not of a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious damage to the upper body.
Authorities blocked beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles said there were over 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s with a plan to harness a stadium in the UK’s cosmetics market
Sainsbury's plans to fight Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with shopping mall-style cosmetic shelves and specialized assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter the UK cosmetics market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and is steadily growing as sales of fashion and home products decline. Larger cosmetic shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be installed in more stores next year if successful.
Investing in cosmetics is part of the way of supermarkets to use the shelf space that was previously utilized by televisions, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it plans to double its cosmetics range in up to 3,000 brands, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get extra space with marked areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The store also plans to re-sell its Boutique cosmetics range so that the majority of the products are vegan-friendly, but younger consumers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test product stands in two of Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened in Croydon in south London last week and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the increased tendency of consumers to buy small amounts of food daily in neighborhood stores mean that supermarkets need to put more effort into getting people to come to them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stores would look more and more like shopping malls as the retail chain tries to combat the low-end stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury’s has set Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat stores since both chains were purchased two years ago. According to them, it has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The first attempt of the store to revitalize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments did not succeed.
Sainsbury's tried a partnership with Boots around 2000, but it ended with a dispute over how to share the revenue from pharmaceutical sales in the supermarkets.
The new policy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyd’s Pharmaceuticals, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these programs by adding a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing manager of Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve revolutionized the look of our cosmetics shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be available for advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet every need. A charming environment and convenient locations make us an exciting cosmetics store that transforms old shopping habits."
Peter Jones is 'scarred' by Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became "enraged" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his company to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their household goods and accessories brand, Truly.
The company had been likened to Goop, the brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, a 37-year-old presenter on This Morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, with a painful head injury by quitting a popular lifestyle company at the last minute to focus on new and profitable deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones has been “sick” at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire when the popular TV lady admitted she didn’t have enough time for the Truly home and accessories brand because of the new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The company has been likened to Goop, the Gwyneth Paltrow brand, and was intended to double Willoughby's assets, with an estimated value of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was going to withdraw from Truly flew Jones from the UK to stay at one of her many summer homes.
A source said: “Truly was Holly’s number one priority.
It was supposed to be her future project that would earn her a living for the next two decades.
Her decision to quit was completely ignored by everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line went to market.
There is a full stock of products at Marlow Headquarters that are ready to go on sale."
Experts believe that the elimination of This Morning, one of the UK’s most popular stars, could cost the company millions due to massive product investments ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household goods, potentially causing further delays in the line’s sale.
It could also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman in March.
The couple spend their summer vacations together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin, a television producer.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm a Celebrity.
Jones said last night, “We don’t want to say anything about his business.”
It’s been a long conversation and then we fell in love.”
He misrepresented the criticism he received from the media for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for the president, and for being so positive about North Korea’s leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating a reporter’s voice.
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He said Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, talks on decommissioning nuclear weapons have come to a halt.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the chief ambassador of North Korea, told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that no “appropriate response” had been received from the United States at the first stages of North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
Instead, he said, the United States maintained trade embargoes in order to maintain pressure.
Trump was more positive in his speech.
"We're getting along very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people lost their lives.
Our relationship is great now.”
He said his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim had yielded positive results – missile tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the remains of U.S. soldiers had been returned home.
He also spoke about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, only 200 people were standing there,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause huge damage to the island, hundreds have been killed
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, international relief organizations were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to flee their homes, a state of emergency was not declared, but it is a prerequisite for international organizations to start aid operations there.
“In many cases, they have unfortunately made clear that they are not going to ask for help from international organizations, so this is difficult,” said Ms. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear when foreign aid workers can start working in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the country’s emergency agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be allowed to assist in the relief efforts.
Given the prevalence of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly ill-prepared to deal with the elements.
Tsunamis have been erected in Aceh, but they are rare sights on other shorelines.
It appears that the lack of tsunami-protection whistles in Palu has increased the number of casualties even though a warning has been issued.
Even in the best conditions, it can be challenging to travel between the many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A medical ship that has been docked in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made it the main point of his campaign to improve degraded transport routes in Indonesia and has put a lot of money into roads and railways.
Lack of funds has troubled Mr. Joko’s board of directors, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to contend with persistent tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative religion.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, ties against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was under 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then attempted a shot to the goal towards the far pole.
The ball flew high over the goal and towards its right corner.
The ball eventually passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped up, and into the net.
"I just wanted to try to get in this position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as far as possible, so I tried to create as much time as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touched once and didn’t think much about it, but just took the shot.”
Chelsea were over 1-0 in the half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In the attack, the Chelsea striker gave the ball with a heel kick to Mateo Kovacic and then bounced from the middle to the half of Liverpool.
Kovacic allowed the ball to pass quickly in the middle.
He then sent the ball forward and sent Hazard in for a penalty.
Hazard ran off the defenders and scored in the far corner with a left foot shot past Alisson Becker, Liverpool goalkeeper.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the Premier League finals at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA European League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Death toll rises to 832 after tsunami in Indonesia
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to a report by the country's emergency agency early Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman, said at a news conference that a large number of people were buried when buildings collapsed in the 7.5-point earthquake on the Richter scale on Friday. The earthquake caused tsunamis that reached heights of up to 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, was covered with debris from buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been initiated after a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to come forward if they saw or heard anything.
Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask all those who were in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
Also, I would like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on camera with their car cameras to contact us, because they might have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and was found inside an apartment.
In the afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman came to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and the police say they are working to inform the closest relatives of the victim.
The cab driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, tried to get back into his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
People have been told that many hours may pass before they can go back in.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was now considered the scene of a crime.
A weeping woman came to the scene.
She keeps repeating, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were inside the marked area and one car was just outside.
Several police officers stood inside the marked area and watched the residential buildings.
Anyone who might have any information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crime Line anonymously on 0800 555 111 and provide the number 247 from 30 September.
The British Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the latest memorial to be accused of "rewriting the story"
The prohibition of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of his ferocious Puritan escorts on so many cultural and religious gems of England.
The Cromwell Society, however, said Mr. Crick’s proposal was “a faker” and “an attempt to rewrite the story.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the ongoing debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be hit.
The opposition of the English Civil War to cultural symbols was neither a decree nor the execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a mark of the 19th-century spirit and is part of a man's history that many still believe deserves praise.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is believed by many, perhaps rather late in the 19th century than today, to have been the protector of the Senate against external pressures, in his case the Kingdom.
There is still much historical controversy as to whether this description is entirely correct.
However, it is certain that the conflicts that were in the middle of the 17th century have shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known individual who represents one side of the conflict.
It is worth celebrating and remembering his achievements as the protector of the state.”
Pig attacks Chinese farmer and kills him
A pig attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him in a market in southwest China, according to local news.
The man, named exclusively by his surname “Yuan”, was found dead with a ruptured artery and covered with blood near a stall in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to news from the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccine into pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
According to reports, he had travelled with his uncle from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his uncle found him dead and saw that the door to the nearby pig-house was open.
He said that inside the staircase there had been a big goose with a bloody mouth.
A court investigation confirmed that the 250 kg bog had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My uncle’s legs were bloody and wounded,” the uncle, with the surname “Wu,” told the Guiyang Evening News news agency.
A security camera footage showed Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not the property of Yuan or his uncle.
The marketer told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it did not attack anyone else while police were collecting evidence on the scene.
According to the news, Yuan’s family and the owners of the market are in talks about compensation for his death.
There are recorded examples of pigs attacking humans, although it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously wounding the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 kg pig squeezed a Welsh farmer by a tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that blood tasting can arouse aggression in them.
“They’re just playing.
They’re curious and they don’t want to hurt anyone.
“You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rose carry heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States
As predicted, the intensity of Hurricane Rose decreases as it crosses cooler oceans off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rose will carry heavy rainfall that could cause flooding in the north of Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rose became a Category 1 hurricane, with winds of up to 136 km per hour at 5 in the morning at east coast time on Sunday, and it was located more than 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to head north on Sunday.
At the same time, the formation is slowing across the Pacific Ocean and it will head east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rose arrives on the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will follow a large amount of tropical rain in the north into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rose will accompany up to 25 cm of precipitation in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, the tropical rainstorm will mix with the lows that are approaching, forming high and wide-reaching precipitation over the southwest in the coming days.
Local precipitation of 2.5 to 10 cm can cause dangerous rapid flooding, soil movement and possible creeping in the desert.
Excessive tropical rain will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected in some places in the southwest, especially in most Arizona states.
There is a potential for sudden floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the dispersal of tropical rains.
People are strongly advised against walking into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn gulls into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms result in storms and dust storms.
The approaching station will carry a local rainfall in certain areas of the southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of more than 1 cm of precipitation, which could cause slight movement of the soil and slip on roads.
This is the first rainy season in the area.
Several scattered tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before precipitation spreads over a larger area late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy precipitation will spread across four states on Tuesday and last through Wednesday.
In October, temperature changes are expected everywhere in the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain somewhat warm.
Sometimes this can cause high temperature fluctuations over short distances.
It was a great example of warming in the United States on Sunday.
There is an almost 7 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent summer aryes will try to build up and spread out again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern parts of the United States will receive a warm start in October with temperatures around 25 degrees or more from the southern plains to the northeastern states.
The temperature could go up to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates that temperatures above the US average are highly likely in the early part of October.
More than 20 million people watched interrogations over Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people watched the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated Supreme Court judge, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual offences alleged to have occurred in the 1990s. The testimony was broadcast on six different channels.
Meanwhile, the political strife continued and television stations paused their regular schedule to publish the latest news on Friday: Senate Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona proposed a bill to allow the FBI to investigate the allegations for one week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Board she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was confident that it had not happened.
More people are likely to have watched the trial than the 20.4 million people Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company measured average viewing of the TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other TV channels showing the interrogations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has problems measuring people’s appearance in offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar in size to that of the football finals or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, most of the interviews, which took place all day, were watched on Fox News Channel, or 5.69 million. The commentators of that channel have loyally supported Kavanaugh's nomination.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was a lot of interest after the trial.
Flake was the centerpiece of the game on Friday.
After the office of this Republican MP issued an announcement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, filmmakers captured CNN and CBS images of protesters shouting at him on Friday morning, as he attempted to get into an elevator to meet with the Judiciary Committee.
He sat down for a few minutes while it rained over him on CNN.
One woman said, “I’m standing right here in front of you.”
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
People said to him, “You have power while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed, he said he would comment further at the committee meeting.
The cable and television stations were all live later when the Judiciary Committee decided whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be forwarded to the Senate.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the other nominees next week, but a minority of Democrats have encouraged it.
Flake was convinced in part after conversations with his friend Chris Coons, a Democratic senator.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
Flake's vote was crucial because it was clear that Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has granted permission to investigate the FBI's allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'being in a political match' over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of “being in a political game” about Britain’s future and undermining the country’s interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside her interview on the cover of the paper, Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, granted the so-called Chequers plan on Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union should charge each other tariffs was “absolutely absurd”.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested one suspect in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge police.
Authorities released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, saying Sims lost their glasses in the conflict.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they had found Simpson's genetic material on them, according to CBS's sister, WAFB.
Police said Simpson confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
According to his attorney, a certain amount of $350,000 was guaranteed.
The office of the forensic therapist in East Baton Rouge County released an interim report on Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and down to the neck.
Authorities wanted to thank the Louisiana police force, the police crime lab, the Southern University Police Department and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports chairman Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement officers for “his diligence and search for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two-meter forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and took 2.6 rebounds for each game in the last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was “shocked” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
“It’s something that you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano spews ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention in the United States advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the crater and recorded 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center observed vibrations and quakes from the volcano.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ash on car windows in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as in Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalonian separatists just before the birthday of the independence referendum
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters tackled riots and thousands took part in protests on the first anniversary of the controversial elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists stoned a riot police officer with eggs and threw powder paint that formed dark dust clouds on the streets, usually full of tourists.
Conflicts also broke out later in the day, and police used clubs to keep the fights under control.
Groups of separatists shouted, “We won’t forget and we won’t forgive” for a few hours while their opponents shouted, “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were in need of care for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions continue in the region a year after the referendum on 1 October was declared illegal by the Madrid authorities, but was welcomed by the Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters opted for independence, but participation was poor, as most of those opposed to separation ignored the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to halt elections at polling stations around the area, resulting in a conflict.
Groups of independents had stayed outside for the night on Friday to prevent protests in support of the country’s police.
The protest went on but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, took part in the separatist protests with his wife, saying he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy at being able to marry, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved a necessary but narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalonia’s independence parties have had a hard time keeping up this year, with many of its best-known leaders being either exiled voluntarily or in detention pending trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took up the protest in support of the police on her phone, said that politicians in both camps had encouraged the dispute.
“The tension is increasing all the time,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned and pending trial since late last year, announced that he would offer himself to the European Parliament next year.
“My campaign in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen in the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car was driven to house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly driving a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves had been damaged.
It is also possible that a crossbow was shot in the direction of the vehicle.
Menga scores 1-0 win for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal won by Livingston
Livingston's team, which came from the lower league, came in the open for the Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the difference and Gary Holt’s team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard has not yet won in the Premier League this season and plays against Hearts, who are eight points ahead in the top spot, next Sunday.
For that game, the Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna in the European league on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still unbeaten in the league with six victories, and Holt has not yet suffered a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Loses Opportunity to Bitterless Guests
Holt's team should have been over a long time before scoring a goal, but their directness caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot a pass after slipping through the defense to receive a bald transmission from Graig Halkett across the goal.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them in peace, knowing they could cause the guests trouble in the right places.
And that’s how the important thing was done.
Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga, who took over and scored from the middle of the penalty spot.
At that point, the Rangers had control of the ball, but the defense of the locals was unbreakable and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper, did not have to put in much effort.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Allan McGregor, Rangers goalkeeper, and Lithgow shot from the goal after a strike from Livingston.
Questions were constantly dropped on Livingston's penalty area but were kicked off, and two demands for a penalty - after Halkett's defense against alternate Glenn Middleton, and one remaining hand - were dismissed.
"Great" at Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Great performance and finals for Livingston.
For an ordinary man, they stood up brilliantly and continued to exceed all expectations on their rise.
Their playing style and team members have hardly changed since they returned to the top league, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for polishing the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was extremely good and led a full-fledged defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes all the time.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s control, they played far below expectations.
They went badly to finish their raids and managed only once to open the field half of the locals so this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers who now sit in the middle of the league.
Erdogan gets a mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and bright sky on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany with the aim of improving relations between the two NATO nations.
There have been differences between them on issues such as human rights, freedom of the media and Turkey’s accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is home to most Turkish residents outside of Turkey itself.
Police used security measures to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters gathered in its vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also heard and condemned both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
The two Protestant groups reflect the controversy of this guest, who is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Deptford accident: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, around 10.15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics provided care, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash occurred a few months after another cyclist died in a crash in which a driver drove off on Childers Street, one mile from the accident site on Saturday.
Police said she was working to identify the man and let his closest relatives know.
The road has been blocked and buses have been routed, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards were wounded when riots broke out in male security prisons, according to a statement from the Prison Prosecutor’s Office.
Revolts broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9.30 a.m. on Sunday and are still raging.
"Tornado" special forces have been summoned to the area to try to contain the riots, involving eight detainees, and are only in one wing of the prison.
The guards were treated for minor facial injuries on the scene.
A spokesman for the Penitentiary Department said: “Specially trained prison guards have been called out to deal with cases ongoing in Long Lartin Prison.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
No violence has passed in our prisons, and we make it clear that the culprits will be handed over to the police and could expect to spend even more time behind bars.”
More than 500 prisoners are in Long Lartin prison, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October last year, a riot police was called to the scene to deal with serious disturbances to peace, where staff with billiard balls were attacked.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with rapid flooding (dry areas could benefit from)
Tropical storms are rare in Arizona, but they are likely to occur early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rose cross the southwest, with the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Agency has already issued warnings for sudden floods Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is planned that Rose will cross Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late Monday with precipitation.
The Phoenix Meteorological Office said on Twitter that “only ten hurricanes have managed to maintain their strength to be classified as tropical storms or depressions at a distance of less than 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 60 miles (64 km) from the Arizona border.
The latest forecasts from the country's Hurricane Center predict 5-10 cm of precipitation, with occasional precipitation up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Precipitation is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas in the southwest, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with the possibility of occasional precipitation up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of sudden flooding, the precipitation from Rosa could be a blessing as there are severe droughts in the area.
Although flooding can cause a lot of damage, some of this precipitation will have a positive effect, as drought is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Agency, at least a huge drought is present in over 40 percent of Arizona, but it is the second-highest category," according to news from weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rose will land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rose was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum windstorm of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north at 19 km per hour.
The storm passes over the cooler seas in the Pacific Ocean, and its power decreases as a result.
It is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm in the afternoon of Monday or Monday evening.
There is a potential for high rainfall in some areas of Mexico, with a significant risk of flooding.
“Precipitation is expected to reach 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwestern part of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm of precipitation,” the company said in a statement.
Rose will then continue north across Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach the border of Arizona early on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. She will then continue up through Arizona and arrive in southern Utah late on Tuesday evening.
“The main threat expected from Rose or its remnants is extremely high rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern part of Sonora and the southwestern desert area of the United States,” the Hurricane Center said.
These precipitations are expected to cause life-threatening floods and movement of soil in the deserts, and crawl into mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition was said to be "steady".
One 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked for witnesses who may have phone records of what happened.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Followed Evil and Anger' by Democrats
“The vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the relentless and disgraceful practices of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “sent the evil and anger” of the Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he sexually harassed her a few decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified before the committee on his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans have seen genius and humanity and courage" Kavanaugh the other day.
“A vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a striking curriculum vitae as a civil servant,” he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the midterm elections.
“It’s been five weeks in one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I don’t really do it, but I really do,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going all over the world to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats were working to “detain and obstruct.”
The first key vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh’s nomination should take place no later than Friday, according to an assistant to the Republican leadership in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died from earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number of dead is likely to rise
At least 384 people died and many were washed away as huge waves fell on the beaches, as a large earthquake and tsunami ravaged the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at sunset, rinsing out a large number of people and destroying everything that happened to them.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5-degree earthquake at Richter.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t flee immediately, so they died,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Agency, at an information meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, tree drums, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled across the open ocean at 800 kilometers speed before it hit the beach.
Some climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed many ruined buildings and shops, twisted and destroyed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to ride across the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Institute for Food and Technology said in a statement that the energy released in the large quake on Friday was about 200 times that of the atomic bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which lies at the end of long and narrow bays, could have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was "significant" and that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under debris from collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and property damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the source of the earthquake.
Communications “are completely down and no information is being received” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
“Over 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," the Red Cross said.
The agency was criticized by many on Saturday for failing to report that a tsunami had spilled on Palu, although officials said the waves had come within the time the warning was issued.
In a video posted on social media, someone could be heard shouting from the upper floor of the building to warn the people on the street below that a tsunami was approaching.
Minutes later, the tsunami hits the beach, carrying away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video yet.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a power failure that prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to organize relief efforts.
The army has begun to send airplanes with aid supplies from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but people who have been helped by the region still need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for aid activities and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit Palu refugee centers on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia exceeds 800 after a tsunami.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu safely, where they seek shelter in tent cities that were set up in the park outside their offices. Destruction was apparent to them on the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"People said they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Aid groups have begun difficult relief efforts, but some have complained that foreign aid workers with high expertise would be hampered from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, stocks and staff can only begin to arrive if the accident area is declared a disaster area.
It has not been done yet.
“This is still a local accident site,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open the door to foreign aid, but no statement has yet been made.”
When the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and their families who are still missing kept hoping that their loved ones would be one of the miraculous stories that shed hope on the depressing headlines that accompany natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was rescued.
On Sunday, relief workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under ruins for two days with her mother’s body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian glider team, had been the coach of two gliders, now missing, for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were locked up in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“As a man with a long experience in gliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that hours after news arrived within the glider group because the Roa Roa hotel had crashed, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants who stayed in Palu and participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only gray markers, instead of blue ones.
“I think that means the message wasn’t received,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while refilling at ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves kidnapped $26,750 from an employee of Brink, who was filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police report.
“The driver of the car had been emptying an ATM at the amusement park and was filling up more money on him,” police commissioner Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was doing his job, another man came “running behind the Brink employee” and stole a money bag intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, according to the report, but the police did not say how many were involved in the case.
Those who may have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West is going to change his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing, “The being formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi on the show, but she quit for "emotional reasons," the producer said.
West has previously said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also an abbreviation of his current name.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier in the year when he spoke to Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye - to be just a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former colleague of West, has also written his name both with and without capital letters.
Mexico's president-elect says he won't use the military against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has vowed to never use military force against civilians, now the country will soon be silent to commemorate the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge days of students.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador vowed to “never ever use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers fired a peaceful march in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were firing roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to help young people in Mexico by giving all students a monthly grant and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of learning opportunities attract young people to crime gangs.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of AI, the United States should double the money it spends on research in that field," said Kai-Fu Lee, an inventor and user of AI who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were said after different departments of the US government issued reports of AI, even though the United States has no formal comprehensive AI program.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the funding that goes into AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we’re waiting to see the next big discovery in the field of AI,” Lee said.
Duplicating capital could double the likelihood of the next major discovery in artificial intelligence being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s major AI companies.
He worked on artificial intelligence systems in the '90s at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best American player at Othello, and later served as Microsoft Research's chief executive officer and Google's Chinese department president.
Speaking of previous technology competitions held by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Robotics Competition, Lee asked when the next competition would be held, to spot the next entrepreneur.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that grabs the big thinkers, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired geniuses from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its artificial intelligence research.
“I think those with a PhD in artificial intelligence should get a residence permit automatically,” he said.
China’s parliament released its future artificial intelligence plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Institute of Natural Sciences provides funding to people who work at university institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up an AI center, which is intended to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on AI.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it invests over $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation, which was intended to create a safety council on artificial intelligence, has not progressed for many months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "North Macedonia" in an attempt to settle decades of disputes with Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a region called Macedonia and claims that the name of its northern neighbours is equivalent to a claim on their territory and therefore denies them accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the identity of the majority of Macedonians of Slavic descent.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the vote, and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50 percent minimum required for the vote to be considered valid.
The question on the ballot paper is, “Would you like to join NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say this is a fair fee for Macedonia to join alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those that were formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the outcome is not legally binding, enough senators have said that they will abide by it and bind it to law.
The change of name would require the approval of two-thirds of the Senate.
The polling committee said nothing unusual had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the Macedonian referendum on whether to change the name of the country, which would pave its way into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Congress in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, aged 54, worked on preparing a small range and aligning chairs in front of tents that had been erected by those who would ignore the vote.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not going through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to something else like China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the necessary funds to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will agree that over 80 percent of the country's population is in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said approval would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, which is lower than the minimum required.
Another poll by Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would say yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum is not approved, it could mean the first serious shock to the government’s policy in favour of the West since it took office in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, passes through all defense Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended Brighton 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the pitch at the start of the attack.
He sprinted past three defenders of Brighton and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-clad defenders.
He got past one defender and then ran away from another right next to Brighton.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English forward used the first touch within the penalty area to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play against Mathew Ryan, Brighton's goalkeeper, with a shot in the right side of the goal.
"Aguero has some leg problems," City chief executive Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were fortunate that he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the Premier League.
Mark came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a pass far in the middle of Brighton in that attack.
He sent a glorious long ball to Leroy Sane's left.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent Sterling towards the far pole.
The striker sent the ball into the net just before he ran out.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a knockout game against the Rockies
Since the Nationals have been ruled out from playing in the finals, there was not much reason to force a second start.
But the zealous Scherzer hopes to pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to make it to the finals, but they have a one-game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
The Rockies won a 5-2 win at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still striving to win their first league title.
“Even if we play for free, we can at least play for the electric atmosphere in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing their best game of the year.
Why shouldn’t I want to compete in such a situation?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be the first pitcher in Sunday's game, but it's believed they'll have Scherzer thrown under these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was starting a game for the 34th time, took a training session on Thursday and would pitch on a Sunday, which is his usual rest day.
This right-handed pitcher at Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 blows in 220 2/3 rounds during this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the case of Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court judge, when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the mid-term elections.
“Everything is at stake in November.
Five weeks in one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are some of the big, big... I don’t offer myself, but if I do, that’s why I’m going all over the country to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump said, “You see this horrible, radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to go to get power and control, they just want power and control, we don’t give it to them.
He said the Democrats were working on “detaining and obstructing.”
“And that’s been seen for the past four days,” he said, saying Democrats are “furious and evil and cruel and untrue.”
He named senator Dianne Feinstein, the ruling Democrat on the Senate Judgment Committee, and was answered with a loud bell from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who wrote the book?
Ha, what.
No, no, no. I waited for one... it was really bad body language, the worst thing I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a tolerant church.
He does not like those who express their thoughts.
When Momentum activists in my party chose to reproach me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last of many Labour MPs to have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our thoughts.
Joan ryan, my congresswoman, received similar treatment because she vehemently objected to prejudice against Jews.
In my case, the suggestion to reproach me came about because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings to leave no one out and be successful.”
In my eight years as a member of the Labour Party, Friday’s meetings have been just that.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of “gentler and better” politics has been forgotten, if it ever started then.
It has become increasingly clear that different opinions have not passed in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged by whether the leaders of the party consider them acceptable.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, who I previously thought had similar political views to me, began to expect me to take a complete reversal and support views that I had never before agreed with, whether it was on national security or the common EU market.
Every time I speak publicly - and then it doesn't matter what I say - it follows the rampant abominations on social media calling for my expulsion, middle politics denied and I said I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I know I’m luckier than some of my colleagues, as most of the comments I get to me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those who have to endure the scourge of sexual or prejudiced insults daily but never retreat.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political era is how attacks and insults have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a tolerant church, and with every motion of distrust or change of electoral rules, the party becomes increasingly narrow.
I’ve been advised many times over the past two years not to be too loud, and then I’d be “all right.”
I didn’t want to be involved in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the negligence of Thatcher’s government that left my classroom in disrepair, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in the city council or in Congress.
I have never hidden my political views, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policy views and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that as the country heads for Brexit, which will harm our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my devotion to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to send is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those within my constituency, whether they are Labour members or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threat of deviation or political expulsion will discourage me from doing what I think is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touchdowns may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amusing game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership league.
They are now at the top of the list and the only team out of ten that remains undefeated.
In the end, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made the locals more victorious and Peter Murchie’s coach had every right to be happy.
“We’ve had tough opposition in our games so far and are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Compliment them, they used their opportunity better than us.”
Mark Grant Anderson came over Ayr in the 14th minute after Frazier Climo reversed the attack, but a yellow card to the Scottish captain, who was allowed to play the game with the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers count and Jason Baggot managed to score a touchdown.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by a penalty before scoring with a kick just before the half and then touching a goal and Ayr came over 17-5 in the half.
But Melrose started the second half with strength and touched Patrick Anderson, after Baggot reversed the attack, reducing the goal difference to five points.
Ruaridh Knott had to take a long break to deal with serious injuries that had to be sustained on the playing field, and afterwards Ayr continued to take the lead with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo reversed the attack.
Blair Macpherson, Ayr's captain, then received the yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of being over with a touchdown from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a fierce attack.
The locals, however, came back strong and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow panel for tackling Clima without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind Ayr, after a free kick.
Climo reversed the attack, as he did again immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe captured the kick of David Amrstrong from the penalty spot and sent to Gregor Henry, who scored the fifth touchdown of the team.
Star the Still Game episodes ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems ready to move into the restaurant business after discovering that he was hired as a manager of a restaurant company.
Kieran, aged 56, plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC show, which he writes and plays with his old entertainment partner, Creg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming season 9 will be the last, and it appears Kiernan has plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the managing director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn’t want to say anything about the story, but a Scottish Sun source said Kiernan wanted to join the “living restaurant industry” of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia's coastal land hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines guard the headquarters of the Navy in La Paz.
General buildings flag the blue flag.
Fleet stations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are marked with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it.”
Across the landlocked Bolivian coastline, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody conflicts of the 19th century is still fresh in the memory - along with the desire to sail through the Pacific again.
These hopes are perhaps the strongest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1 after five years of proceedings.
“Bolivia possesses the power, the spirit of unity and the intransigence, and of course awaits the decision with a positive mind,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many residents of Bolivia will observe the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, in the hope that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of their claim that Chile is obliged to grant access to the sea to Bolivia, after many decades of difficult dialogue.
The ruling on Monday is also very important for Evo Morales, the country’s Native American president, who will face a controversial battle for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court ruled in favor of Bolivia, and that it would little change if he did so.
The Court, which has its headquarters in the Netherlands, has no power to grant land from Chile and has stipulated that the ruling will not affect the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ruling comes just six months after listening to the final hearings indicates that the case "had not been complicated," said Paz Sárate, a Sicilian expert on international law.
It is also possible that the last four years have not been the case for Bolivia to advance, but rather have caused the country to regress.
"The current government of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
Morales’s harsh discourse has diminished all goodwill from Chile, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks sometime, but it will be extremely difficult after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represented the country in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Chile” and an opportunity to “end a 139-year-old conflict for the benefit of both countries,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this issue as a political hedge.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said it would never take down its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri gave his speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises they made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart talks on nuclear weapons more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s “dreamy” to think that continuing trade bans and U.S. protests against a declaration about the end of the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington will not accept the declaration unless Pyongyang takes clear action first to take down its nuclear weapons.
Both President Kim and President Donald Trump want to meet again at a second meeting.
However, there are strong doubts that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons, which it sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion Shows in Paris present the latest line of big headwear that will come in fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a variety of quirky oversized hats for their SS19 line in the fashion scene that fascinated the jets of the Paris Fashion Week.
Numerous images of extremely unsuitable hats have been posted on Instagram this summer and these designers have had their innovative creations on display at fashion shows.
The main work of Valentino was a large light brown hat with wide ribbons that resembled feathers and covered the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included watermelon jewels, steak hats, and even pineapples, which are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of strange masks, just at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had embroidered lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than high-fashioned.
One mask resembled a scuba diving device with a plunge pipe and glasses, while another resembled melting ice cream in bread form.
If you want to get into fashion, luck is with you.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon be on sale in the fashion stores near you.
Large hats come close to the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with over 60cm large linings that has adorned the head from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion label behind the extremely unsuitable hat, which was seen on all social media, was inspired by other large accessories that appeared in the fashion field – a beach bag made of straw that was almost as large as the swim-wearing model that wore it.
The orange straw bag, with strawberries and a white leather handle, was the main part of the La Riviera SS10 Jacquemus line of clothing at the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, the stylist of the famous people, said in an interview with FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in the fashion stores for next summer – where the designer has caused such a huge impact it should be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for world citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding achievements of their students and it has continued in 2018 with new, impressive test results, which are still supported by individual and group achievements in sports, arts, music and other social practices.
These schools have up to 30,000 students across Scotland, with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in charge of them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further postgraduate studies, the career they have chosen and their status as a citizen of the world.
As a teaching sector that can assemble and teach from specially designed curriculums, we see that new language continues to be a popular learning material in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it will touch his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we can’t just rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show us that languages are at the top of the list with the highest percentage of students who pass exams in private schools.
Sixty-eight per cent of students who learned foreign languages received a grade A.
The data, collected from 74 schools within SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students received an excellent A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received an A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
At the moment, languages, as an elective subject, are placed in the same place as science-related study materials (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 poll conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that, for reasons stated by employers that it was difficult to find a job, 17 per cent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future jobs.
Now that more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career people choose, learning another language will have a real advantage in the future, but it is a skill that will last a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will give a multilingual person an automatic advantage over competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent of them were unable to speak another language well enough to sustain conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children of today to invest immediately in language learning.
Multilingualism, especially in emerging markets, will give children a better chance to find a significant job.
In Scotland, the language they teach varies between schools.
A certain number of schools will focus on classical new languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK when looking up to the year 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, he will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools commit to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in the global business environment, language continues to be essential for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should really be seen as “international communication skills.”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity and superiority for Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the chairman of the Scottish Private School Council.
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
"It will be longer than a minute and shorter than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for the Lakers, said on Twitter that James would likely play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his schedule for the Lakers' six-game schedule for the start of the season.
“At this time of my career, I don’t have to play games before the season to prepare,” he said.
Schedule for Trump’s West Virginia election and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of ballots and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five scheduled meetings next week, where he will also stop at friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the ballot to confirm his election for a new Supreme Court judge has been put on hold, Trump aims to build up support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Senate when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s election in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at East Coast time this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below through live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the trial of nominated Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, where tensions prevailed over sexual harassment allegations. The Senate vote to confirm him as a judge was suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But Trump’s main goal is to help the Republicans recover, who are awaiting tough elections in November.
The message from Trump’s campaign was that these five meetings, to be held next week, aim to “fill volunteers and supporters with the enthusiasm that Republicans are trying to protect and increase with the majority they have in the Senate and in Congress,” according to Reuters news agency.
“Governance over the Senate is so essential to the President’s plan that he will travel to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins,” Trump’s spokesman told Reuters.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling and supporters are expected to come from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh media will report on him," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
The meeting on Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia this month, which he won by over 40 percent in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, who is at the bottom of the polls.
"It's not a good idea for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows commitment to keep hope alive for individual competition on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-player, which was Saturday afternoon, could be exactly what was needed in this race for the Ryder Cup.
Swing in success is a sporting concept that has been invented and that players so truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like this.
Where would they say that happiness is now?
“They had a six-point advantage and now it’s four points, so success is on our side now, I guess,” Spieth said.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four stages ahead with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, think they have a little wind in their sails and they can be hopeful about many things, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played very well with his example.
The shouts of applause increased with the passing of the ring and he put down an important putt to cut all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points down after two games.
His putt, which guaranteed them victory in the 15th hole game, received a similar shout of joy, a shout of the kind that tells you that he believes that the American team still has a hope of victory.
“You just have to dive deep and think about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do right now.
18 holes to earn points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but breathtaking European pair has won four games out of four and can’t do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who got a flush on Saturday afternoon, but they also managed to avoid a flush on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon, and on the nine-hole pitch on Friday morning.
That game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audience clearly shows that they are the pair that need to win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, as the sun sets over the Le Golf National stadium.
The best option would be for both to do it at the same time on different holes.
It’s still too early to talk about the win of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played lightly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-game in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
Shots and two doubles in the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they could never scratch themselves.
But on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your hole.
The four balls and the four games are so exciting to watch in close quarters because of the communication between the couples, their advice, the advice they don’t give, and how the game schedule can change in one go.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a considerable advantage for the final day, but this quadrilateral round also showed that the team of the United States has a fighting spirit that some had doubted it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 lead for the Ryder Cup final day
Europe will have a good lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup after the Four-Blade and Saturday’s Four-Blade, with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who had won four points at Le Golf National.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who would like to regain the trophy, which it lost at the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the U.S. team in the morning's four-ball match, winning 3-1.
The United States showed more opposition in the four games and won two games, but failed to make up the score difference.
Jim Furyks team needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the cup going.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four consecutive points and he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a fabulous weekend, are just the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Four-Blame Game, they showed great team spirit and won downtrodden Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau 5–4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius on occasion, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball games and four-ball games, including seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning ball game, returned to his fellow golfer Henriks Stenson in the four games and won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third on the list of the best golfers in the world.
Europe, however, did not fare well on this mild and gloomy day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, three-time winners of the World Series of Golf, set the goal for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won 2–1 against Jon Rahm of Spain and Ian Poulter in the Four-Ball Games and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4–3 in the Four-Ball Games after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has won four points at the start of the individual competition, although Furyks team would only need a draw to keep the Cup going.
However, after two days in the second place, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be overwhelming.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament 'impossible' without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that continued trade bans were only diminishing their distrust of the United States and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant actions to show goodwill” over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test zone, and promising to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any similar reactions from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible that we unilaterally take down our nuclear weapons first.”
Although Ri has repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “staged” approach to nuclear disarmament in which North Korea would be rewarded for every step taken, his statement seemed special in that he did not deny unilateral nuclear disarmament purely as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first meeting between the US president and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on “the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula” and Trump pledged to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought a solution to end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must abandon its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax a strict embargo on North Korea.
“The United States is demanding ‘nuclear disarmament first’ and increasing pressure by using trade embargoes to achieve its goal, and even protesting the declaration to end the war,” Ri said.
“There are only dreams of people who don’t know anything about us to think that bans can bring us to our knees.
But the problem is that continuing trade bans increase our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader talked about at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korea’s leader Moon Jae-In over the past five months, adding: “If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, this plight in the case of nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula would not be.”
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different last year when he said at the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to launch missiles from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after “the diabolical president” Trump called Kim a “firefighter” in a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump threatened to “destruct” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that trade bans would continue until North Korea had destroyed all of its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The trade bans of the Security Council must continue until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and it has been confirmed.”
The Security Council agreed to increase trade bans on North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to close funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and afterwards said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that success had been achieved, but just hours later North Korea denounced him for making “criminal demands.”
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to take down a missile zone and a nuclear power plant if the United States took “corresponding action.”
He said Kim had said that the “corresponding actions” he sought were security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore and actions toward normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes in sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an attempt to counteract the growing tendency of students to stay awake and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study found that students at the world’s best universities often know little or nothing about the basics of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and the Women's Hospital, designed the course and believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea to do the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning ability.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I told this first now, in my final year?’
She said no one told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told Telegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits help learning ability and performance in sports and even contribute to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health care, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were very sleepless over the week.
The course is an hour long and involves various interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can deteriorate with lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a good routine for sleep.
In the second part, participants are told how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know, just as one has a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture that celebrates those who stay awake and learn all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring good quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to protect against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep increases the brain’s call for food so that the body is constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemistry and physics from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, who sat one of the professor’s cursus last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all the students in the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all master students to complete a similar course before they start studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them up, bearing in mind the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can confuse the internal clock of the body and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrards men
The Rangers were still in trouble on the field when Steven Gerrard's team had to settle for a 1-0 loss to Livingston, after a goal from Dolly Menga.
The Ibrox team wanted to make their first win on the field after their win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt team gave the Gerrards team only their second loss in his 18 games as manager. The team is now eight points behind Hearts, which is in the top position in the Ladbrokes Premiership league.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half and the Rangers seemed to lack all inspiration and were never likely to equalize.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, but Livingston goes up to third and is only behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
The Rangers may be in further trouble after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after some object was thrown into him from the field half of the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and made the final in the Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, stayed with the same Livi 11 setup that reached the level of Hearts last week and he had been pleased with how well trained his team members were rolling over the resistance.
The Rangers were perhaps more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the ball it reached.
They should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game when Menga's first pass came to Scott Pitman in front of Allan McGregor's goal, but he shot a pass.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then ended up with Craig Halkett, while Alan Lithgow, his defender, shot past the far pole.
The Rangers regained control of the game, but seemed to live in hope rather than faith in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that he should have been punished at the end of a quarter of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian call.
The Rangers only scored two shots in the first half, but Liam Kelly, former goalkeeper Ibrox, didn't have much to do to defend the baldness from Lassana Coulibaly and easy shots from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the 34th minute opportunity from Livi would have come despite the other team’s superiority, no one can deny that they deserved it, but only because of their perseverance.
The Rangers again failed to do anything from a long free kick from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose to send to Menga who then easily scored.
Gerrard took action in halftime and sent Ryan Kent in in place of Coulibaly, and the switch had an effect almost immediately when the rear guard came in, but Kelly quickly reacted and ran forward to block the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to trick the guests into playing exactly the type of game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett scored the long haul one after the other.
Holt's team could have increased their lead on the final amine, but McGregor did well in denying Jacobs a chance before Lithgow ran from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, the Rangers' alternate, wanted another penalty when he and Jacobs fell down, but Thomson rejected it again.
Almanac: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here is a page from our calendar "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and AFTER... this is the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for studying and measuring radioactivity, and this invention eventually led to a device called a Geiger meter.
The Geiger meter has gained a firm place in science since then but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
The man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger meter, used to find radioactive substances such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on you, you can hear the effects of the atoms due to the radioactivity in the stones."
Evans: “It’s really buzzing right now!”
Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to 'See' Dangerous Cells
A new anti-cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches your immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of your treatment
The treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and transforming them in the laboratory
They can then “see” the protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and is then injected back into the patient.
Vaccines at the experimental stage have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to recognize dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and transforming them in a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 found in many types of cancer. Then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that the vaccine is extremely effective.”
HER2 “allows various types of cancer to stop growing,” including breast, ovary, lung, and colon and rectum cancers, said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure in which immune cells are removed from patients and they ‘learn' to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West gave a long speech in support of Trump and wore a MAGA hat after appearing on SNL.
It did not end well
Kanye West was in the Saturday Night Live studio after a lengthy speech in which he praised President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After releasing his third song of the night, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great hat, he spoke for a long time against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve talked to white people so often that they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a trailer in which Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee over Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment allegations.
Although West was not released, the recording was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
Not sure if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the tape.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received bad reception from the backstage because of his hat selection.
“I was thrown into the backyard.
They said to me, “Don’t go up to the stage with this hat.”
They beat me up!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to news from the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Would you like to see the deep hole?” and said that he would put on his superhero robe “because that means you can’t command me to do things. Do you want the world to progress?
“Test the love.”
His remarks were met with a beating from the audience at least twice, and SNL actors seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, and one of the attendees said to the newspaper: "There was a stone silence in the studio."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his performance as he sang the song I Love It, dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from TPUSA chairman Candace Turner, who said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR SHOWING THE MUNICIPALITY RESPONSIBLE.”
Karen Hunter said on Twitter, “West is simply being himself and it’s wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) who I feel supports and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
“We are too,” she added.
The rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was “the being formerly known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself the Snoop Lion, and not to be forgotten the musical myth Prince Promise, who changed his name to a symbol and later called himself the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder after knife attack at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will go over the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of the Coronation Games, criticizes poisonous masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's The Crown Series.
The 31-year-old actor, however, has criticized the stereotype of the male hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they need to be tough to earn respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something went wrong” and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old co-star Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong views” on how to deal with this issue.
Personally, I think at the moment – what has gone wrong with the man?”
“What have we taught men in their childhood about the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in poisonous masculinity, due to the extremely masculine characters on television.
He continued, “What is congenital and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to be a certain type of man?
I think that’s one of the most important questions of our time – how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong with young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that he would not play in any other Crown Series after the season closes next summer, saying that he had "a lot of battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will star in the remake of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother who is a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about having played in the Crown Games was having met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife in these shows, so they kind of gave me my future family and my life afterwards,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow, who Kit played in these Emmy Award-winning shows.
The couple married in June 2018, in the country of Lesliar’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new infections were transmitted through sex, which is a change from what was before.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to donations of infected blood.
The number of people infected with the HIV virus in this way, on the other hand, has fallen to almost zero, according to Chinese healthcare professionals at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people continues.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections occur due to inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been promising access to HIV medicines for all as part of a plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked data from Republican senators, criticizing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her employees had published personal information of three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles said these claims came from “super-right-wing” extremists and websites.
“Lies, lies, and more miserable lies,” Waters said in a statement.
The information contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday from an unknown party on Capitol Hill during the hearings with the Senate on Brett Kavanaugh, nominated Supreme Court judge, over sexual harassment allegations.
The leak came sometime after three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said the IP addresses identifying the source of the information were linked to Waters’s office and published information about one of its employees, according to information from Capitol Hill.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is absolutely false and a pure lie," Waters continued.
“My employee – whose personal data and security are now at risk because of these false allegations – was in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unsubstantiated accusation is absolutely false and a pure lie.”
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized online, including by Ara Fleischer, a former White House news secretary.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“That means she doesn’t have the guts to sit on the floor.
When someone is accused for no reason, do not react with anger.
There can be no opposition.
You cannot question the reasons for the accusation.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters’s reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics said appeared to be too angry at Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate against Waters in the midterm elections, also said his opinion on Twitter.
“It’s a big deal if it’s true,” he said.
In her statement, Waters said her office had “informed appropriate authorities and law enforcement officers of these untrue claims.
“We will ensure that the guilty are found,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all the acts that are damaging and dangerous to all my employees.”
Johnny English Strikes Again – Rowan Atkinson’s spy film turns out to be low-powered
It has become a habit now to look for Brexit references in all new films involving the UK, and it seems to apply in this revival of the Johnny English comedy series – which started in 2003 with the film Johnny English and just woke up back to life in 2011 with the film Johnny English Reborn.
Will this satirical satire about how clearly miserable we are be a new export opportunity for the country?
Regardless of whether or not Johnny English has been renewed for a second time to mess everything up - his name shows above all that he is a creation designed for a show in countries other than English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the witty secret serviceman who claims to have fascinating magic, but is a bit of a mix of Clouseau, a dash of Mr. Bean and a little bit of the man who played a note for the song Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
He is also originally based on the traveler and mysterious world citizen that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, where he left everything to himself in chaos.
There is one or two nice points in this latest Johnny English film.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walking on a helicopter dressed in a medieval coat of arms and the helicopter blades slammed into his helmet.
Atkinson clearly demonstrates his comedy skills, but the humor seems rather powerless and oddly superficial, especially now that the “serious” films such as James Bond and Mission Impossible also offer no hesitation in making jokes.
The joke seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and I thought the fairy tales that Johnny English encountered were not as imaginative and focused as Mr. Beans’s silent comedy posts.
The only problem with the film is that Britain is in trouble.
A hacker has managed to break into Britain’s secret spy network and reveal the identity of all British spies, causing a lot of trouble to the spy on duty – but sadly Kevin Eldon appears in too small a role.
This is the final craving for the prime minister, who is an arrogant and controversial character and already in trouble because of enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with her role as a character to remind her of Theresa May, but the script doesn't have many fish for her.
Her advisers tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had sat down.
And here comes Johnny English himself, now the headmaster of some fine school, but also provides secret instruction on how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes that English offers on a spy school reminiscent of the film School of Rock.
English is summoned back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and meets Bough, his former long-tired partner, who Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine commander, but in this energetic role Vicki Pepperdine is not quite letting her light shine.
The spy widow who messed up everything at her Majesty's service is now back in gear and meets the high-rise Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the prime minister is stunned by the magic of the fascinating billionaire in the tech sector, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problem: it’s the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their tragedy journey: they set fire to a fancy French restaurant disguised as servants, they smuggle themselves into Volta’s luxury yacht, and English turns it all upside down when he tries to wear virtual reality glasses to explore the interior of Volta’s house.
There is nothing to be spared in the final part, but although the film is vibrant and energetic, it still contains some of the children’s material in it as a whole.
Medium-sized material.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his abilities?
The Labour Party denies that it is preparing a four-day work week plan for Britain, with the same salary as for five days a week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow Britain to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to reports, the party wants to let corporate managers take advantage of the savings generated by the revolution in artificial intelligence, and let employees benefit by getting one extra day off.
This means that employees can enjoy three-day weekends without losing their salary.
Sources say the idea would “match” the party’s economic plan and its strategy to improve the welfare of workers.
The Trades Union Congress has supported the shortening of the working week for four days, as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“The change will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits with the Party’s approach to changing the economy for the benefit of workers and with the Party’s overall industrial policy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the aim is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not on the party’s policy sheet and the party is not considering implementing it.”
John McDonnell, the trade secretary of the Shadow Ministry, used the Labour Party conference last week to describe his ideas of social revolution within the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “unknown managers” and “profit collectors” of supply companies.
The shadow minister’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire share back, as the Labour Party government could impose a “withdrawal” for alleged misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers on corporate boards and create a joint holding fund to put 10 percent of the assets of private companies to their employees, who could receive <0xC2><0xA3>500 dividend from them annually in their pockets.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
An FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week-long delay in a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether its findings could get Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be shown on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the 60 Minutes show, asked Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said when the trial began, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the allegations were made and asked, “Did you do this?”
He was determined, firm, unquestionable.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems unchangeable.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an unbelievable accusation to change that,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it," Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“And anyone she names couldn’t confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new going to change.”
What is the International Citizens’ Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The International Citizen Festival (Global Citizen Festival) will be held on Saturday in New York. It is an annual music event where a series of big stars will appear and with a similarly influential strategy; to end poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the International Citizens’ Festival and tens of thousands of people will be flocking to Central Park, not only to listen to musical performances from Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, among others, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The International Civil Festival, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, an international campaign that seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people who fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), concertgoers had to complete a variety of tasks, or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to any of the world’s leaders, making a call, or using other valid means to help draw attention to their goal of ending poverty.
But how much success has the festival achieved, now that there is a 12-year strategy to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a real way to convince people to call for action, or is this just a so-called “click action” – where people feel they are doing something that matters by signing a claim list online or posting a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “actions” from its supporters, calling for a variety of different goals.
It says these actions have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over $35 billion that will impact lives over $2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notifications for its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and executive who works to “help children enjoy themselves to the fullest,” promising to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, sponsors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can put the social injustice of malnutrition to the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, a representative of The Power of Nutrition at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 petitions were sent that the UK should improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
On the FAQ list on the group’s website, one of the questions is: “Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult task – sometimes we will fail all the time.
But, we will reach our goal, just like movements that fought for the rights of citizens and abolished racial segregation before us, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe will be performing at the event this year in New York with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy as 'barrier' to block Russian energy exports, interior minister says
"If necessary," Washington could use the navy to prevent energy in Russia from reaching markets, including the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, according to a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke argued that Russia’s aid to Syria, especially as the country works at the initiative of the legitimate government there, was a pretext for exploring new markets.
“I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy like in Eastern Europe and the south,” he said.
And, according to a public announcement, there are ways and means to counter it.
“The United States can use the naval force to ensure the openness of the waterways and to create barriers, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not come to market,” he said.
Zinke addressed a guest meeting hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and said it was more or less the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation of energy sources and the substitution of them for others,” he said, saying Russia has only one card in the sleeve with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement follows the Trump administration’s desire to expand its natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, officials on Trump’s board, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project to lay a new energy pipeline, which Trump says would make Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly claimed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 power line, which will double the transmission capacity of the current pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely economical.
The Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool to apply pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” said Russia’s Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial federation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere with the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I am very unhappy that foreign countries are taking part in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “considerate seriously” proposing to run for the presidency in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would “consider seriously” running for president after the mid-term elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider presenting herself to a civic meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then we need a woman as a leader," she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Speaking about President Donald Trump at the meeting, Warren said he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been undisclosed from his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for Supreme Court Justice.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter that “of course we must have the FBI investigate the matter before the vote takes place.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters do not believe it should be offered in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not be offered, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her offer.
The poll showed more support for Deval Patrick, a former governor, with 38 percent saying they support his possible offer and 48 percent saying they are against it.
Other popular Democrats who were discussed for a possible 2020 presidential election included former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Speaks About PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump Election Meeting
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday.
“My son is going through a lot of hardship after coming back, I feel sorry for other families affected by PTSD and the mental wounds that our soldiers return home with,” she told audiences at an election rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other warriors "came back a little differently, they are hard-hitting and wondering if there is any respect for what their comrades in the army and air force and other military units have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for attempting to obstruct reports of domestic violence, and for use of arms under the influence of alcohol, according to Wasilla Police spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 States and Washington D.C. Support Challenge Against New Asylum Seekers Policy
Eighteen states and Washington City support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies victims fleeing gang or domestic violence for asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the city submitted a court report on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposes the policy, according to a report by NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit put forward by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her husband "and his abusive sons who were gang members" abused her, but U.S. government officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries where problems related to gangs and domestic violence are growing. The number of asylum seekers to the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum seeker policy revokes a ruling issued by the Immigration Appeals Committee in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignored decades of federal and international law.”
"Federal law requires a decision on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule," the court said.
Lawyers further stated in the report that the policy denying immigration was detrimental to the U.S. economy, arguing that immigration was more likely to start a business and “provide important workforce.”
Jeff Sessions, the state prosecutor, ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Those who leave their homeland due to persecution based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social or political group can apply for asylum,” Sessions said in a statement.
It was never intended to solve all the problems, not even the most serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Palu, whose death toll doubles
Things are getting harder for those who survived.
“There’s a lot of tension in the air,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her ill son at the Palu Relief Center.
“The ambulance brings the bodies here all the time.
There’s not much clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes and searching for their property to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overcrowded and damaged by the 7.5-point earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, whose back and shoulder were broken, were located outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were encouraged to go outside because of an ongoing vigorous aftershock.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I'm pushing up against the wall-wrapping, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, saying that his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and her.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of 'persecution' with 'community advertising'
A week after a public newspaper in China published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper to discuss the mutual benefits of trade between the two countries, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about the Chinese newspaper's announcement in the Des Moines Register - the Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. elections that will take place on November 6, China denies this accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters news agency was a new stage in an expanding campaign from Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is natural for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are in a steadily mounting trade war, with new tariffs on imports of both countries.
Chinese and US experts say China’s revenge tariffs early in the trade war were designed to harm exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for the long term, whose state exports a lot of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in an opinion paper in the Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register that “China was now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda ads in our own free media.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the beloved freedom of speech of the United States and our free media by publishing a cost-effective advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
“On the other hand, there are few protests in the newspaper stalls in Beijing’s streets, and there is no true reflection of the different views that China might have on China’s worrying economic policy, where the media is stuck under the heel of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the biggest newspapers in China escaped the offer to publish” his article, but he did not state which newspaper it was.
Experts warn that Republicans are making female voters dismiss them for the mid-season elections with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the next midterm elections, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, the nominated Supreme Court judge, who has faced allegations of sexual harassment.
There have been very strong feelings around this issue and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they want to start voting.
“These things can’t be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, at The Hill for a paper published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute call by Republican Senator Jeff Flake for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm down voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget tomorrow and they won’t forget November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, spokeswoman for MoveOn, said Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November is approaching!” as they protested in the Senate’s corridors when the Republicans who headed the adjudication committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of voters will rise,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, on the news website.
“People will say the interest has already been great and it’s true.
But he could be bigger, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18-29, who dislike the president, but rarely vote.”
Analysts predicted a relapse if Republicans pressed to have Kavanaugh confirmed, even before Ford's testimony in which she described her accusations of sexual harassment from him.
“It’s a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Still, a former member of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be left in the class, it’s also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated it,” said Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that helps vote Democrats.
However, Americans seem to disagree with whom to believe after the testimony of both Ford and Kavanaugh, and a narrow majority support the latter.
A recent YouGov poll showed that 41% of respondents believed the testimony of Ford, while 35% said they believed Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or indeed lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judgment Board last week, saying that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says Kavanaugh exposed his genitals in front of her when they were both at a Yale University graduation party in the '90s.
The man who invented the internet has plans to start a new internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Internet, is set to set up a startup company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech myth, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
"We have to do this now," he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses technology from Solid to enable people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
There you can have a list of contacts, task list, calendar, music library and other personal and work-related devices.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment by using data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Now, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers hired as contractors to work on the project, and a team of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own independent applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not in talks with “Facebook and Google about whether or not to bring about a complete change that would put their current business models on their heads in one night.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published Saturday on Medium that Inrupt had the goal of “creating energy in business and ecosystems that help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even as he sets up Inrupt.
“I’m fully optimistic for the next era of the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest and holder of the Victorian Cross from World War I honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian Cross in World War I as a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
Pastor Bernard Vann, who served in the army, received the cross on 29 September 1918 in the attacks on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never learned that he had received the British Army's highest honor.
His two grandchildren unveiled a monument to him at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “wonderfully symbolic” that the monument had been unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s honour.
According to the London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his army on September 29, 1918, over the Canal de Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under heavy gunfire from cannons and machine guns."
Later, he ran to the line of fire and with "very much courage" led the line forward before attacking a cannon of one of his own and overthrowing three soldiers.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s heroism was “something I could never do, but something that makes you humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a flower wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt it was a "great honour to take part in the parade" and added that "the virtues of a true hero are shown by the support that so many people show."
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead got to see Gurru pig
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see the overcrowded Bellator 206, just to be denied seeing the main event.
The program consisted of 13 battles from San Jose, of which six were on the main programme and were broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, exactly as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British audiences were surprised when the broadcast turned into Gurra Pig.
Some were unhappy after waking up all night to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to children’s content as “some kind of sick joke.”
“According to official regulations, the material was not suitable for audiences at six in the morning so they had to switch to children’s material,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
“Pigs, yes.”
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they would review their schedules and take audiences in the UK into account in the future.
"I think when I think about the re-release we could probably solve this," Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there and we can’t resolve this until Sunday at our time, which is Monday for them.
But we are working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was switched, many text messages were sent back and forth, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a public problem.
I promise this won’t happen next time.
We limited the evening to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and outstripped ourselves.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley found 'incapacitated' due to sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he felt incompetent towards other people as he grew up because of his sexuality, but that it encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said he didn’t realize he was “different” until he went to secondary school.
On the Desert Island Discs radio show on Radio 4, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that his parenting has diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular TV presenter, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley appeared on Laverne's first show and said he felt like he was "less a man" than anyone else when he was a child because "it was not accepted in society to be fond of both boys and girls."
He said: “Until today, these feelings of being inferior and different have given me the strength and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when he finally found out about his sexuality.
The double-Olympic bronzer has been a huge supporter of LGBT and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he would be heard because he felt fortunate to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The World Triple Champion said it had "surprised him" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re going through that much at an early age” – who participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find peers who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "all life views" had been suffocated.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
"Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son is named to the head of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, aged forty, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t accept that he would die and one of the last questions he asked was whether they had received their tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breathing stopped and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, to dip myself in front of the spectators at home at the Olympics. It doesn’t feel any better,” he said.
It was also inspired by the selection of the first song – Proud by Heather Small – which had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
Mickelson in bad shape and dead sitting on a class in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to regain his old beats so that the record is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the race for the 12th time, was left in the class at the discretion of captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has been so often before for the United States, the day of the five-time champion is divided between being a cheerleader and practicing the game beats on the pitch in the hopes of correcting what he misses.
Mickelson, aged 48, was never the shooter with the pennant, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National golf course, where a bullet would often be punished for bad shots.
And not only is the golf course a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood in the team and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points below when they take the first game of 12 singles games, get off to a good start, Mickelson’s player could make a difference.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the back and hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the hall of fame and he has been so much better for the teams before and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but that’s how it ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo in a number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached quite as high as other achievements on his record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furyk said his presence had a certain vague impact on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s ironic, he’s funny, he likes to make fun of people and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he said.
“I think the younger players liked to bother him this week too, and it was fun to see.
It’s more than just a golf game.”
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows that a great deal of advantage can disappear quickly
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good advantage for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dane first played in Valderrama in 1997, where the side under captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but managed to squeeze a win in the end with the smallest possible difference of points, with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 win.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a lot of advantage in Valderrama, we had a lot of advantage in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama where we won, but only right so,” said Bjorn, who is seen in this picture, after watching the 2018 season win 5-3 both on Friday and Saturday and catching the National Golf 6 ahead.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that it’s not over.
We're all going forward tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not finished until all the stages are on the table.
We have our goal and that is to try to win this cup, we focus on it
I’ve always said that, I’m focused on the 12 players in our team, but we’re very aware of our opponents in the other team – the best golfer in the world.”
Bjorn was delighted with the way his players had stood on a difficult field and added: “I will never go beyond myself in this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow is the performance of the individual that matters, and that is another thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you play one, everyone’s skills as a golfer are tested.
That’s the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to play his best game himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will strive to make his players perform better in individual games than with a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this major transformation on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe performed the "miracle of Medina."
"I remember every damn word," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had encouraged his players for the last day.
“Tomorrow we have to play 12 important games but you want to start fast, as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When that creep gets closer to building up, it creates a lot of pressure on the games that are in the middle.
We put our players in order and let them play as we think they will do best tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and plays against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
"I chose these players in this order because I think they cover all the way through," Bjorn said about his choice of players in the individual competition.
Germany's New Ship Delayed Again
The newest German Navy ship should have been built in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships, but it will not be ready until next year due to defective systems and rising costs, according to local news reports.
The construction of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the brand new warships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to sources from a military spokesman who spoke to Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was supposed to have been taken into service by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems arose after the delivery of the project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the Bremen-class ships, which have come to an end.
They shall be equipped with a more powerful cannon, numerous anti-aircraft and anti-naval missiles and concealment technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features are longer periods of use - the latest ships should be able to be used for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, steady delays mean that these warships of the latest type – which are said to allow Germany to show its strength at sea – will already become obsolete when they are finally taken into service, says Die Zeit.
The F125 ship made headlines last year when the German army officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss slippery slope in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but German media spoke of many women seriously “defective in software and hardware” that would render the warship useless if it were sent into a campaign.
Defects in the software were particularly important because warships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be piloted by a crew of 120, which is twice as small as those of the Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship was far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to make future additions to it.
The 7,000-ton ship Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice the weight of a similar class of ships used by Germany during World War II.
Apart from hardware defects, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - has begun to cause problems.
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), but was originally supposed to be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems affecting the newest ships are particularly important in light of the warnings that the Germans’ superiority at sea is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the navy was in fact becoming “deficient with operational ships.”
The deputy said that the problem had arisen over time, because older ships were taken out of service but no ships came in their place.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg commands could be used by the navy.
The National Trust for the Conservation of Nature spies on the secret life of leather blades
A new study, conducted in the Scottish Highlands, aims to find out how bats use the landscape when hunting for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation measures.
The study, led by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will observe different species of bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the area to monitor the behaviour of the bats over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also go on patrols with handheld sensors.
Experts will audio-analyze all recordings to find out the frequency of call emitted by bats, and which species do what.
Maps of habitats and reports will then be issued to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results reveal what kinds of habitats are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, e.g. by creating meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats has declined significantly in the last century in Scotland and throughout the UK.
They are at risk due to construction and development projects affecting their nests and decreasing habitats.
Wind turbines and lights can also pose risks, including fly paper and certain chemical treatments on building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, the ears are much more useful than the eyes when it comes to hunting prey, because they are used to hunting at night.
They used sophisticated echo-direction technology to detect insects and objects on their flight routes.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization employs ten experts who carry out regular inspections, nesting inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even established the first and only bat-free country in Scotland at the Threave Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten bat species in Scotland have homes.
David Thompson, the farm manager, says he is a perfect area for them.
“The area around Threave is great for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of growing trees and lots of good habitats.
But there is still a lot of ignorance about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
He stressed the importance of checking bats before maintenance is carried out in settlements, as the potential accidental destruction of one nest could kill up to 400 bats and juveniles and completely destroy all bats in the area.
Bats are protected and it is forbidden to kill them, harass or disturb, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative at the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don’t know how many of them are performing well.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has accused him of rape “fake news” and says that people want to “get their attention” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to prosecute the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The head of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 after the incident, according to Der Spiegel.
A few hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, said in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers that they were “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is fake news,” the world champion said fivefold to the camera.
“These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but that’s part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything’s fine,” the player added smilingly.
Cristiano Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable disclosure of suspicions concerning privacy," according to Reuters news agency.
Attorney Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would demand compensation for “the same amount and severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the rectum, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told her he was “99 percent a good man” who fell into temptation because of “1 percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that it was with the consent of both.
Mayorga said she went to the police and had her injuries taken in the hospital, but finally agreed to make amends outside the courtroom because she was "afraid of revenge" and worried about being "humiliated in public."
She now says she wants to quit her concessions because she is still in shock after a supposed incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was supposed to have taken place, and this summer he switched to Italian giant Juve with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK would ‘sorry forever’ to lose carmakers
The UK would “sorry forever” if it lost its position as an international leader among automakers after Brexit, said Secretary of State for Commerce Greg Clark.
He added that it was “preoccupied” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily suspend production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car maker said the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the border would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production facilities in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about exiting the EU without consent on how to conduct international trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns lie in what car manufacturers say are supply chain risks if Brexit without a deal becomes a reality.
Toyota's production line is based on a "last minute" reception, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars manufactured on order.
If the UK withdraws from the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a disruption to the border that the industry believes could lead to delays and a shortage of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a dagger in its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan for Theresa May’s future relationship with the EU “is aimed specifically at preventing these views at the border.”
“We need to have a contract. We want to get the best contract that allows us to enjoy not only success in today, but as an opportunity that we can take advantage of,” he said on BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but other manufacturers as well, shows that we need to be able to continue with a very successful approach.
Toyota could not predict how long their production would stop, but warned that in the long run, increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trustee of the factory’s union, said that his colleagues were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
The government spokesman said: “We have presented a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House announced Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed again by one week" now that the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee for the Supreme Court, continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian elections, links between Trump’s supporters and Russia, and possible obstacles to justice by the president.
For weeks now, rumors have been circulating in Washington about whether Trump will fire assistant state prosecutors and jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said Rosenstein had talked about carrying a recorder to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of overturning the president using the 25th Amendment article of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday he visited the White House, among the news that he was going to resign.
A meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "preferably" not fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed so that he would not be at the same time as a hearing with the Senate Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further postponed the Senate’s vote.
Sarah Sander, Trump’s spokeswoman, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It’s not set a date for him, it could be this week. I think it’s possible that he will be postponed another week because of everything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we will see and it is always a pleasure to inform the media.”
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the small number of meetings was not due to dissatisfaction with the fact that television reporters had “virtuosity,” but she said, “I don’t disagree with the fact that they have a virtuosity.”
She then gave indications that direct relations between Trump and the media would increase.
“The president answers more questions to the media than any other president has before,” she said, without reference to sources: “We’ve reviewed these numbers.”
“If the media has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me,” Sanders said.
We’re trying to do a lot of that, and you’ve seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks, and it’s going to replace media meetings when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown why in New York this week, when he showed restraint and at times strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Health Minister writes EU health workers in Scotland over concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working within the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express their gratitude to the nation and wish it to continue working after Brexit has passed.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter in less than six months until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the costs of operating licence applications for EU citizens working in the public service sector.
Miss Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer, talks between the UK and the EU over resignations have continued and decisions are expected this fall.
The British government has also been working on preparations if a deal is not possible.
I know that this must be a time of great uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I value the work of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and knowledge that strengthens and improves the work of healthcare and benefits the patients and the communities we serve.
“Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Christion Abercrombie, Tennessee State Tigers line-up, had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss match against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to reporter Mike Organ, Tennessean.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State Superintendent, told reporters that the injury had occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there," Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a bar and worn out for further inspection.
Tennessee State Representative Chris Harris, WSMV broadcaster in Nashville, Tennessee, said Abercrombie had undergone surgery at the Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there was "no information on the nature or severity of the injury yet" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in his final year of school, plays his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before he left, which increased his total tackles to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged for higher stamp fees when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in the UK. The excess money will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Conservative Party plan
The action will annihilate the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp charges will be applied to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The U.S. Treasury plans to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in the UK. The excess money will be used to help the homeless. Theresa May will announce this today.
The action will be considered an attempt to nullify the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by promising affordable housing and taxing high-income earners further.
Individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK will have to pay higher stamp fees, and the excess money will go into government action to help the homeless.
The increase – which is in addition to the current stamp charges, including the increase imposed two years ago on extra homes and real estate purchases for rent – could be up to three percent.
The Treasury estimates that the increase will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by foreigners, which causes price increases and makes it harder for those who want to buy real estate for the first time to enter the market.
Many wealthy areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" due to the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp fees to help more young people have their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain’s “housing shame.”
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of significant housing improvements, including rent controls and the final settlement of rented property without cause.
He also wants to give more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would devote myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first season – that every new generation should enjoy better quality of life.
And that involves fixing our unsuccessful real estate market.
The doors of Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for foreigners and companies with headquarters abroad to buy homes as it is for energetic British citizens.
For many, the dream of their own home has become far too distant, and the shame of homelessness is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says it is his “main goal” to become Scotland’s coach someday.
The 42-year-old Scottish now enjoys the challenge of revitalizing the North-East club that now sits in third place in the first league, three stages from the top.
He moved to Sunderland in the summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got injured on my knee and that was the end,” Ross said in an interview with Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden often with my dad as a child, and there’s always something that pulls me back.
But that opportunity would only be available if I did well in training the league.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach said he felt no fear of following in the footsteps of such a big club, but he had previously rejected coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“As it is, I will measure my success by thinking, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
This club is undoubtedly at home in the Premier League because of its structure and facilities," he said.
“It’s not an easy job to get him there, but I’d probably only consider myself successful here if I get the club back up there.”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a coaching team for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling into the third league, and turned St Mirren, who was about to fall over the league, into a league champion the next season.
Ross claims to be more confident now than he ever was in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real breakthrough,” he says of the season when he became Alloa’s coach.
“I really believed that coaching was right for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I was doing well, I had a decent income from it, and had an appropriate success.
Changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I’m still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from the job, but the coaching job seems just right for me.
I always wanted to train and now I do, I’ve never felt better about myself in all my adult life.”

The best time for beer is at 17.30 on Saturdays, according to survey
The heat wave this summer has proved profitable for British bars, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales at pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while sales at restaurants decreased by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin of CGA, the business consultant, said: “The continued sunshine and unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to June, when bar sales increased by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants sold even less.
Sales fell 1.8 percent in restaurants in June and deteriorated again in July.
Pubs and bars, which mainly targeted drink sales, fared best with more boom while restaurants went downhill.
Pubs that sold food also had a hard time in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sales of drinks at pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent a month, while the sales of food decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman, from RSM, said: “These results are a continuation of the fluctuation we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of important social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales in off-home markets.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups are still in trouble, even though a sales decline of 4.8 percent between months is particularly painful on top of continuing cost pressure.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time for dining venues, and only time will tell whether temperate temperatures, as we have had in August, will improve the situation.”
Total growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the pace of the openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the regulator of sales in the British pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the industry benchmark for the sector.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, as young as 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the survey results.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in “artificial Insta” pages
The news has raised concerns that sexually explicit material is being published
Twenty Percent of Students Say They Have A 'Principal' Account They Show Parents
One in five children, as young as 11 years old, creates secret accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a huge increase in “artificial Insta” accounts – a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has raised concerns that sexually explicit material is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main" account to show their parents, as well as having secret accounts.
A mother who fell down on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC, showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” in the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive chairman at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful free sportswoman and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said the nomination would be a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect within the sports community in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and we are confident that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money by getting her on the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of the athletes and hope that I can do my part and help to lead the sport forward in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, but holds a total of four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular visitor to the BBC, was paralyzed after suffering a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I recovered and to what extent.
It’s been a hard work but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and do sports exercises today!
Thank you for your encouragement!”
Breast pump advertising, comparing mothers to cows, causes online disputes
A company that produces breast pumps is now mentioned online because of advertising that carries lactating mothers to milked cows.
The company Elvie published a sleek advertisement to mark the presentation of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump that can be worn on the outside”. The advertisement is inspired by music videos and is supposed to show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cuddle with lyrics like, “Yes, I’m milking myself, but you don’t see my tail” and “If you didn’t notice, it’s not my udders, it’s my breasts.”
“Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump the milk out of the julls.”
However, the advertisement, which appears on the company’s Facebook page, has caused online publicity.
The video has 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments and has received varying responses from viewers, many of whom say that she was misled by the "horror" that accompanies the dairy industry.
“It’s a really bad decision to use a cow to advertise this product.
Just as we do, they need to get pregnant and bear to produce milk, except that the calves are taken from them just a few days after they are born," said one commentary.

Another viewer wrote: “Obviously difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of time.”
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was “interesting.”
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would have bought it if I had a baby.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping milk.
It’s a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
“It’s great,” one of the viewers wrote.
Another said: “This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘comb.’
This is not an advertisement that commends or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the ad, the women show that they have all been dancing with their breast pumps hidden in their breast braces.
The idea behind the campaign is that many women say they feel like cows when they pump their milk.
The Elvie pumpkin, however, is completely silent, has no wires or cords and fits comfortably into the bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and head of Mother, said: “Elvie Pumpkin is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a striking presentation that would spark a resonance.
By comparing females to cows, we wanted to focus on breast pumping and all its challenges, and even show in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pumpkin would provide.
This isn’t the first time Ellie has appeared in the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared at a fashion show for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she was using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Moved Silently to Camps Near Texas Border
The number of immigrant children in detention has increased abruptly even though the number of those crossing the border monthly has remained pretty much the same. Part of the reason is that harsh speech and policies put forward by the Trump administration have made it harder to bring the children into temporary foster care.
In general, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their chances of remaining in the country by offering themselves to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when public authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adults within the home would be required to provide fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the Immigration Service.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an officer in the Immigration and Customs Department, testified before the Senate and said his organization had arrested a number of people who applied to foster single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on a criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in foster homes are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are illegal immigrants on a criminal record.
“We continue to look for them individually,” said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the work of the children, representatives announced new rules requiring some of the children to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous benchmark, according to the staff working in the incidents.
Many of them will attend through video meetings, rather than in person, to argue their legal position before judges in immigration matters.
Children who have been convicted of being unfit to enter the country are sent out of the country as soon as possible.
The longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent tendencies or attempts to flee, according to refugee workers and reports published by the system in recent months.
Proponents said that these problems were even more likely in a larger organization such as Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice even if a child has a hard time, because of how many they are.
They added that transporting the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say goodbye to friends could add to the shock that many of them already face.
Syria calls on US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also said in his speech at the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of vice-premier, said foreign troops were illegal in Syria, under the false pretext that they are fighting terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism was almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred struggle until we cleanse all Syrian areas” of both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreigners.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
As far as refugees are concerned, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return, and he taught “some Western countries” to “spread unfounded fears” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They make politics out of something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funds for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
A recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral area in the last major fortress of the resistance has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The treaty between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack by Syrian troops supported by Russia on the region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, who have ties to Al-Qaeda, and that they would be "exterminated."
United Nations Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene the first sessions with a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition, to draft a constitution for Syria after the war and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to “examining the provisions of the current government,” and warned against any interception.
Reasons why Trump will win a second term
According to that argument, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 re-election, unless charges and scandals put an end to his presidential career, as many liberal spectators probably hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic ending of a presidential career ever!”
As a matter of fact, the audience doesn’t have any signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s best-time viewing has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC’s nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best time, which is an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the episode of MSNBC, “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news nights.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of ABC's "Designated Survivor" drama about a government employee who becomes president after the House is completely destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," is another hypothesis.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" said Miss Scovell to me.
There’s fun in the mess.
However, unlike what is shown on television, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can unite and the health of the international economy.
Only the audience who enjoys the most privileges can afford to stop watching.
And yet this is more than being an informed citizen when you look at the sixth hour of a group of experts reasoning on Bob Woodward’s use of “extremely intimate” sources for his book Fear, or $15,000 ostrich leather jacket worn by Paul Manafort (“a figure that is fed with pride,” the Washington Post said) and the consequences of the biography.
I will never look at Super Mario again.
“Part of what he does and doesn’t let you feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show, Pawn Stars, as he talked about the staff turnaround at Trump’s show and the daily changes in the plot (e.g., starting a fight with N.F.Long and J.L.

He could not snatch himself away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were creating all these crazy episodes in the old days and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilizations,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out that people were right.”

Money outside flows in the narrowest midterm elections
It is no surprise that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania is seeing the money flowing to it, thanks to the reorganization of constituencies that led to two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area sends out Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in a special election last summer.
Lamb offers to meet another representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now a representative of the old 12th constituency in Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
The electoral districts were restructured after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old electoral districts were organized in favor of the Republicans and violated the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th constituency has been the start of a competition in the funding of campaigns between the major funding bodies of both parties, the Democratic Electoral Commission (DCCC) and the Republican Electoral Commission (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania, many of whom followed that election.
Republicans had previously warmed that seat for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the election by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a little advantage.
The U.S. has decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but has since withdrawn.
The Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017, and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the co-owners evicted the management team of the Trump conglomerate.
State Department officials decided to recall the US ambassador to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to a "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement early this month.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for relief efforts in 2017, including for drug control, development efforts and economic support.
The penalties, which included, among other things, a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the granting of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, where there is high unemployment and high homicide rates.
As in-house meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives postponed a conference on security and economic success and were to follow a similar meeting held last year that was considered a step forward in actions to prevent people from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, representatives from the top ranks made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus ending all speculation about punishment against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is addressing the conference, which is due to take place in mid-October, as a symbol of how important it is to the government, the ambassadors said.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss further the discussions described by the three U.S. representatives, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the internal disputes against being allowed to be anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the board and also spoke about the issue of anonymity.
Learn the story
The next scandal could be Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible actions to obstruct justice, for which there is a wide range of public evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller is also investigating whether Mr. Trump’s campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Senate is ruled by another party, Trump may have to be accountable to it, as he prepares to meet his voters again, and perhaps a jury appointed his peers.
However, it is very uncertain and I do not want to argue that the fall of Trump is unambiguous, nor the fall of his colleague in Europe.
We all need to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the battle will be.
In 1938, German rulers were ready to rob Hitler of power, only if Western countries had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak people in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of calamity that followed.
The story revolves around such important points and speeds up or delays the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The United States is currently facing a number of important challenges.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this paper said that last year he had proposed to make secret tapes of the president and discussed whether he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is wrong.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recent investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair, or if he is confirmed to be a Supreme Court judge despite plausible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we elect a Congress in the middle term that will let Mr. Trump shoulder responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I think we will not fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that previously sat in my ambassador’s residence.
She survived, moved to the United States and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I but look positively at our future?”

Graham Dorrans, Rangers team, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will face Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to get up from the G-Team of the European League. The Rangers made a spectacular draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
Injuries to the knee prevented central defender Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season until the game against Villareal, which ended in a 2–2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can use the results as a jumping board for better results.
“It was good to get this point for us because Villarreal is a strong team,” said Dorrans, aged 31.
“We started the game thinking we could achieve something and ended up taking one point.
Maybe we could have squeezed out a win in the end, but on the whole, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came strong in the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important night for the European league.
Hopefully we can achieve three points but it will be a difficult game because they did well in their last game. But with the audience supporting us, I am sure we will make it through and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that took place in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling in the place.
The team is good and the boys enjoy themselves, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go further now, put the last season behind us and achieve success.”
Women lose sleep due to fear of losing retirement savings
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
About half of the respondents in the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to care for it, but they don’t take the right steps to have those conversations,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide life insurance.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t make your wishes clear in advance.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you get care, because these options can change a lot in terms of cost.
Get your financial advisor involved: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay the cost, or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you own it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal disputes in advance.
Get a health care manager so that you can appoint someone you trust to oversee your health care and ensure that healthcare professionals comply with your wishes if you can’t tell them directly yourself.
Also consider getting a procrastinator for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your accounts are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in an emergency and on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Please provide this information in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just about the finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have a plan ready.”
Man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun on his way home on foot after having fun.
The victim is a man in his fifties and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Representatives described the shooting, which occurred around 2:30 a.m. at British local time, as a “random attack.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
The man was not injured and the police called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Since all communications are down, relief workers have not been able to provide any information from Donggala County, which is an area north of Palu and lies near the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter.
More than 16,000 people left their homes in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 380 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is a administrative area under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly in Morowali, which is on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Tsunamis have flooded Palu and Donggala several times in the last century, according to the Indonesian disaster agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when a tsunami struck and hundreds of homes in Donggala were destroyed.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the active fire ring of the Pacific Ocean and there are regular earthquakes.
Here are the biggest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh province in northern Sumatra occurred on December 26, triggering a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean coastline, of whom more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people die on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 on Richter struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on Richter rode over one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, raising up to 10-metre-high tsunami waves that destroyed numerous villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A foundation earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya county in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly earthquakes and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami occurred this time, but over 100 people died as buildings collapsed.
2018: Large quakes ride across the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stuck on the island.
Eldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former Alaskan governor and presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence for attempting to prevent reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to an Alaska State Police report released Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin picked up her friend’s phone when she tried to call the police to report an alleged crime.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su station where he is awaiting trial, and he is being held against $500 bail, according to a report from the KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, stating that he was “certainly not guilty” when he was asked to declare guilt or innocence.
Palin has been charged with three Class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and would have to pay a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with class B offences, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is now in treatment for the Alaskan surrender court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing reports of domestic violence and carrying a weapon under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of surrender soldiers in 2016 after she taught PTSD about her son’s violent behavior after his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications systems are down and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred in the middle of Sulawesi Island, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing when the incident happened are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist in New York City
New York prosecutors want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of having been involved in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violating federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is believed to have taken a Home Depot truck on rent to attack people on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. He drove there down pedestrians and pedestrians in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intentionally” and caused serious bodily injuries “intentionally,” according to the statement of will to apply the death penalty, which was recorded in the Southern District Court in New York.
Both of these charges could lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal court indicted Saipov in 22 counts, including eight charges of murder for criminal purposes, which are usually used by prosecutors in prosecutions against organized criminal organizations. Saipov was also charged with violent crime and for destroying the vehicle.
The attack involved “a considerable planned planning,” the prosecutors said, describing Sapiov’s actions as “terrible, cruel, and immoral.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was caused bodily injury, injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York City’s last death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers and was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a New York court case in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, couples who were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
They were both killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigator that he was doing well with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has declared his innocence on all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, said they were “of course disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a statement of guilt against life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the shock of this event for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov’s lawyers had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek the application of the death penalty.
The Conservative Party MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead negotiations over Brexit.
Nigel Farage pledged to “activate the people’s army” today in protest at a Conservative conference.
This former leader of UKIP said politicians would have to “feel pressured” by skeptics about the EU, at the same time as one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone told the protest rally in Birmingham that Britain “would have gone out” now if Mr. Farage was the leader for Brexit.
But the challenge that May faces in reconciling deep differences between her own team members became even more apparent as conservatives, who want to remain in the EU, took part in other anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track and is facing criticism from those who support Brexit, those who oppose it, and the EU.
Allies claimed she will continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition – forcing those opposed to Brexit and the Labour Party to choose between her plan and “unrest.”
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave march in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of the Chequers plan”.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been allowed to participate and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out now,” he said.
The MP from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan.”
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone dismissed evidence that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: “The notion that the British public has changed their minds and wants to stay is completely false.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative supporter of Brexit, was also at the rally and told reporters: “I simply want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is unpopular among the public and the opposition will not vote with it. She enjoys unpopularity among our party members and activists who are on the streets and electing us.
Please, stop the Chequers program and start listening."
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farage said that the politicians would have to “feel under pressure” if they were to betray the decision made following the 2016 vote.
“It’s now about trust between us – our people – and our political party,” he said.
“They want to try to betray Brexit and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We won’t let you get away with this.’”
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to put pressure on your political party, which is betraying Brexit.
We are mobilizing the public army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain.”
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest rally in Birmingham that ended with a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved the flags of conservatives against Brexit after the group was set up over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, of the Labour Party, made fun of the Conservatives because of the security problems that came up in the party's phone application when the conference was opened.
“These are the people who are telling us that it can have all the computer systems in order and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for borders without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders,” he added.
“This is a complete scandal.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren is going to “consider seriously” to run for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “severely consider a presidential nomination” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts discussed his future at a public meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has uncommonly criticized President Donald Trump, offers to run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of controversy that she could stand out against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting in the form of a civic meeting with residents of her constituency, since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then a woman as a leader too.”
Arrest after deadly shooting of Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that she had arrested one suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot dead on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying a person who was seen on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde came to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to having been on the scene, with weapons in his possession, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and detained by the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was 2 metres tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games, 10 of which were in the starting team of the last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points, reaching 2.9 rebounds in each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the winning seat on the orders of their team.
It was clear from the time that Valtteri Bottas took a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that orders from Mercedes team would play a major part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start, almost leaving Hamilton behind when he defended his position in the first two turns and offered Vettel to fight his teammate.
Vettel went first in the pit and let Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, which should have been the decisive factor.
The Mercedes went into the pit one circle later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton emerged after a brief conflict where Ferrari's driver was forced to leave behind on the inner side after being at risk of being left behind, after defensive attempts in the third turn.
Max Verstappen was seventh at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race as he postponed changing tires to try to finish quickly and surpass Kimi Raikkonen and reach fourth place.
He eventually entered the pit in the 44th circle, but was unable to speed up the remaining eight circles, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri stood up beautifully all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me out.
"The team has done a great job to achieve this," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
U.S. President Donald Trump joked about Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday over her allegations that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not directly discuss Ford’s testimony before the Senate Senate Judgment Board, instead saying that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “woeful and cruel and untruthful.”
“The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and cruel and untrue,” he said.
“When you see the impressions and the leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you read this?
Do you remember her answer... you read the document - "Oh, hey, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t laugh at it.”
Just wait a minute.
“No, we didn’t,” he said, imitating the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, revealing the allegations made by Ford against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked in early September. Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t read her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and I did as she asked.”
But her denial didn’t seem to go well with the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I’ll tell you, that was really bad body language.
"Maybe it didn't leak, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense against Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, alleging that Democrats were using the allegations in his favor.
“They’re determined to regain power, no matter what methods they have to use.
You see the cruelty, the wickedness, no matter who they hurt, who they have to roll over to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars compensated for their loss on Friday in the Elite League league against the Belfast Giants, by winning in the next game, 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-point lead after a goal from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised for the locals, but Dwyer came back over the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third losing game of the season for Adam Keefe, who had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game between the teams in the season, and the Giants had won the three games before.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute at 3:35 a.m., after a support from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford then came with a support when Beauvillier doubled his lead four minutes later.
Sullivan brought the locals back to the game when the clock showed 13.10 and Cownie then averaged after a 15-minute support from Matt Marquardt.
Dwyer made sure to get the Giants over for halftime when he scored his second goal in the game at the end of the first game-third.
The home team recovered and Bouchard scored again when they were one man over in the 27th minute of the second game-third.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen get Dundee over for the first time in the game late in the second game-third, and he secured his team's victory with a fifth goal when half of the last game-third had passed.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller kills to ensure hundreds of passengers on plane escape from earthquake
Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely and whole.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tidal wave.
Large aftershocks continue to ravage the area, and many are trapped under ruins in the city of Palu.
The 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his colleagues had fled the control tower that swung violently at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufr airport in Palu.
He was staying to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake struck, could safely take off.
He then jumped from the control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are very sad to hear this," he added.
Authorities fear that the number of dead may exceed 1,000, as the country’s disaster agency says access is limited to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The number of dead is still rising because many bodies are still under demolition and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman.
Up to six-metre waves have wreaked havoc on Palu, where mass funerals will be held on Sunday.
The military and passenger aircraft work to bring supplies and supplies.
Giant Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings a body.
There is very little clean water.
“They have been robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to find survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, came to Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the missions related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says it is missing after plane crashes into lagoon
The airline, which owned a plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, after having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had survived from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it did not know about the fate of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about further details of the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
The officials said Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane had landed in the lagoon close to the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway too far.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the approach to the plane had been extremely low.
“It was really good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to climb the waist deep into the water and reach the emergency exits in the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants had been frightened and shouting, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were working close to the dock also helped with the rescue by using an inflated boat to take people to shore, before the plane sank into about 30 meters of deep water.
Data from the Agency shows that 111 people have died in the crashes of PNG-registered aircraft in the last two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
Expert describes the timeline of the night that a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors closed their case on Saturday in a reopening case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for many hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile phone records to puzzle the journeys of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she had received location data from a number of mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, according to a news report from The Clarion Ledger.
When evidence showed that his cell phone was at Chamber's at the same time he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said she had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted text messages, phone calls, and her contact information from her phone.
“He destroyed her from her life,” Hale said.
Defenders are scheduled to deliver their final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be brought to trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
Hipp hopp triangle wants to fight negative opinion towards the music genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that hip hop has distanced itself from its origins as it contained political messages and dealt with social issues.
They want to look for origins again and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent boom in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York's Fetus Sues Marriage for Dismissal After 'Prejudice' Text Message
A New York nurse sues a couple for unlawful dismissal after she received a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple refuses to be prejudiced and likens the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out that her new foster mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
“NEEEEEIIIII OTHER BLACK MAN” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Ms. Maurice.
Upon discovering his mistake, "disgraceful" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying that their former foster-mother, who was black, had behaved badly, and that she expected to have a Filipino wife, according to a report by the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for her one working day and then sent home in an Uber car.
Maurice is now suing the couple and wants to receive compensation for the eviction, amounting to $350 a day for the six-month job she had originally been hired for, although no contract has been signed.
“I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do that,” she said in an interview with The Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have objected to the accusations that they are prejudiced and say that firing Maurice was the right thing to do, because they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message that she wasn’t going to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We’re not prejudiced people,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But who would trust their children with someone after being rude to them, even if it was a surprise?
His newborn child?
Come on, come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to “extortion,” saying his wife was seven months pregnant and in “a very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to attack someone in this situation?”
That’s not very nicely done,” said Plasco, who works in the investment sector.
The case is still before the court, but the public has spoken harshly about the couple on social media and shamed it for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get in the footsteps of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
“It’s very funny now that we know of Paddington’s tremendous success.”
She said her father, who worked as a filmmaker for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a small toy bear, had taken the rejection of his work with a calm positivity, adding that the book's 60th anniversary was "delightful" after his death last year.
As for Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important family member,” she added that her father had shown quiet pride in his success in the end.
“He was a very quiet man and not used to boasting,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who does something, and you’re proud of it even if you haven’t really done anything by yourself.
I think that’s how he viewed Paddington’s success.
Although Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the credit for it.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her through the phone
When she landed, her daughter had been transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
"Nad called me regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heartbeat up were gradually losing its activity and being excreted from the body.
She had died shortly before and this was the body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to be in control.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her deceased daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she was experiencing.
“Nobody knew anything,” she said.
“I was crying and tears were falling all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a lot of compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women hang up messages to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a message on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, the son of Miss Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day,” she said.
Miss Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney and said that her son had been a successful cook with an infectious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could light up any room."
He stopped working before he died, because he was “sucked down in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, 11-year-old, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Miss Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that there will be repercussions.”
Ms. Davis created the message “to let people know that you can go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don’t sit and say nothing – you need to talk to someone.”
Ms. Humphreys, a friend of Ms. Davies for years, lost her fifteen-year-old husband Mark shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say anything about being sick or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
She said that his death was a big shock to them, but that they had to work their way out of it: “This is ripping a hole in the family.
This will tear us apart.
We have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's Future Hangs on a Thread as FBI Has its Investigation
“I thought if we could get something similar to what he asked for — a study with limited time and scope — maybe we could make a little bit of a reconciliation,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was “dismantling” in the middle of a dispute between the parties where everything was backlocked.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their inconvenience is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are in just five weeks, on November 6. If the Republicans fail, as expected, it seriously weakens their attempts to get their husband elected to sit on the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, who was Mr. Bush’s private secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its investigation report?
A vote will be held at the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently seated.
It is not yet certain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break up the tie and confirm him in the office of Supreme Court Justice.
The number of North Korean refugees “decreases” under Kim’s leadership
The number of people fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean MP.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unification council, said that 1,127 people had fled last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges levied by people smuggling were key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people flee to China, but it has the longest border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross them than the well-covered neutral areas between North and South Korea.
China sees the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly over the past month.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions that focused mainly on postponed negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This was after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to co-operate towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho taught the U.S. trade bans about the lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally take down our nuclear weapons first,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh ‘Mothersick’ and Says He’s Unfit to Serve as Supreme Court Justice
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in Congress, called Brett Kavanaugh, the nominated Supreme Court judge, “mother sick” and said he was too moody to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would have been called madman,” Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Senate Judgment Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was extremely emotional, and sometimes shouted and got a chuckle in his throat as he talked to his family and his school years.
He also publicly denounced the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him “a disgusting and organised reputational killing” by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was biased towards Democrats.
"I think these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats show that he is unfit for the job," she said.
Pelosi did not respond when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired if he is confirmed and if Democrats gain a majority in parliament.
“I’ll say this: if he’s not telling the Senate or the FBI the truth, he’s not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court, but in the court that he is now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh now serves as a judge at the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she would have been concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade Abortion Act, where he is considered a conservative judge.
During the interrogation, Kavanaugh turned to questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is no time for a morbid, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say ‘a lot is wonderful’,” Pelosi said.
Women need to take advantage of it.
This is a fair saying, months and years of rage flow out of it and it does not come out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s uncommon, but you?”
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said she was crying too when she got angry, but she had developed a technique so that when she got angry and started crying, she said to her interviewer, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from a previous job I held in an office with men in the majority, where I began to cry with anger that I could not express, an older woman came and grabbed me by the neck. She was a cold boss that I had always feared a bit and she dragged me into the stairway.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” she said.
They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and happy to have reached you."
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart during his presidency, a Democrat from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught cheating on a boat named Monkey Business and withdrew his offer, Miss Schroeder, full of frustration, thought there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to the president.
“It wasn’t a good decision,” she said laughing at me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone named it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign was long overdue, she was lagging behind in terms of fundraising, so she vowed not to offer herself unless she was able to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters who donated $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she asked.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not formally offer herself, she was so overwhelmed by feelings—gratitude to the people who had supported her, resentment towards the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and focus their attention on voters instead of representatives, and anger into gender discrimination—that she burst into tears.
“I might have had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder said as she recalled how the media reacted.
“Kleenex could be my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my gravestone?
“She cried?”
Reasons why trade wars between the US and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the US and China were outrageous, and although the war is far from over, gaps between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing a tax on China’s major exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week with new tariffs covering goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), and taxing nearly half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same currency every time and recently imposed 5 to 10 percent tariffs on U.S. products worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to respond to U.S. tariffs and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will succumb soon.
In order for Washington to recover, it must yield to demands, but it would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the President of China, to bow publicly to the United States.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing keeps the cards right, pressure from the trade war with the United States could have a positive effect on China in the long term, by reducing the mutual need for both economies for each other.
“The fact that a hasty political decision either in Washington or Beijing could lead to conditions leading to economic collapse in either country is actually far more dangerous than audiences have previously admitted,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria 'prepared' for refugees to return, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for refugees to return to the country and seek help to rebuild the country, which is now in poor condition after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, the foreign minister, told the UN General Assembly that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to bring about normal conditions by building areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return willingly to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic decisions aimed at their daily lives and jobs.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more still living in the country are in need of aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian authorities would be happy to accept assistance in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept aid subject to conditions or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 points at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive European losses and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the race, hit the 16th hole in the water and lost his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone sharply in all his games and became 1 of 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, since the race began using its current format in 1979.
Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who was in the lowest position in the European rankings.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top golfer, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup competition.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times for the Ryder Cup, became the most successful European champion with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
It has been a difficult year.
I am so thankful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have the cup back.
It's about the team, and it was a pleasure to be able to help," said Garcia after the European victory.
He won his countryman John Rahm's torch, defeating the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a singles match on Sunday.
"I was incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the competition for the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is only in second place behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding themselves on the pitch all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk, after disappointing his team's performance, said, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
It was sometime in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost it down.
I'll take down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players play well.
We’ll get back together, I’ll work with the PGA in the US and the Ryder Cup committee and we’ll continue.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their captain.
You have to take it down.
“They played better than us.”
