While an experimental vaccine seems to be able to reduce the death toll of Ebola, there are no medications that have until now proven themselves to treat existing infections.
An antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially seemed promising in the field, but formal studies indicated that it was less advantageous than intended to prevent death.
In the PALM study, ZMapp served as a control, which would mean that researchers used it as a starting point and compared the other three treatments against it.

This confirmed, not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on the upper with a pale or carotenoid-colored bottom.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers when it comes to birds.
Since the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other properties of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers assumed that rachis was most likely a later evolutionary development than these other properties.
The feather's structure suggested that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature control or viewing. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimens show adult plumage and not down from a baby bird.

The current Senator, and Argentina's First Lady Lady, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced her presidential candidacy last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometres away from Buenos Aires.
Kirchner announced her intention to run for president of the Argentine theatre, the same place that she used to start her campaign for the Senate as a member of the delegation in the province of Buenos Aires in 2005.
The debate was sparked as a result of controversy over the spending for emergency relief and reconstruction, as a result of Hurricane Katrina; which some fiscal conservatives comically called "Bush's New Orleans deal."
Liberal criticism of the reconstruction efforts has been directed at the gains the contracts for reconstruction have given to the current individuals on the inside of Washington.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by Sagittarius' galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be a result of tidal force between the galaxy and the Milky Way's dark material.
Just as the Moon exerts a pulling force on Earth causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a pulling force on the galaxy Sagittarius.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affected other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of many small particles.

They are colder than the surface around the day and warmer at night.
"These thermal behaviors are not as smooth as large holes on Earth that often maintain a relatively even temperature, but this is consistent with the fact that these are deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology team from the North Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a stall and put a preprinted paper note indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
After officials verify the voter's identity, the voter puts the envelope in the voting box and signs the voting form.
French electoral law codifies the treatment relatively strictly.
Since 1988, voice boxes have been content to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes there at the start of the voting procedure and that no envelopes are added except those from carefully counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to monitor every part of the process. In the evening, the voices are counted by volunteers under close observation and following specific procedures.

Her first was slalom where she received a ‘not finished' in her first half. 36 of 116 competitors had the same result in that lap.
In her second lap, the giant slalom, she came tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than winner Claudia Loesch, from Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth place Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's sitting group failed to complete their trip, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom failed to rank in the lap.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant Police Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have found her laptop and mobile phone."
The indictments are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki has said that the accused had appeared in court with their covered face.
Although three people were on the inside of the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver of the car suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the generous Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later he was moved to the Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with killing his son in Edinburgh's Sheriff's Court.
She is in custody pending extradition and trial, but evidence from eyewitnesses may have been manipulated as photos of her have been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's legal system seems different and the court has considered that the publication of images as possibly prejudiced.
Professor at the University of Dundee, Pamela Ferguson, said "journalists seem to take a dangerous direction if they publish photos and the like of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Authority, which has the combined responsibility for prosecutors, has indicated to reporters that no more comments will be given at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Pakistan wishes based on the pre-Middle East War borders in 1967.
Other topics covered, according to reports, include the future of the State of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the conflict over the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed while the Palestinian authorities agree only in such a presence for five years.
Shooters in the supplemental pest control test project were to be carefully monitored by guards while the effectiveness of the test project was being assessed and monitored.
In a partnership with the Service for National Parks and Wildlife and the Sports Shooter Organization of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sports Shooter Organization hunting program.
According to the acting director of Park Protection and Heritage at the Service for National Parks and Wildlife, the first four selected shooters for the first shooter operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Election Council (CEP) of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional election council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to hire the country against new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to a widespread anti-regime protest that began in October.
The sometimes selective protest had been triggered when no elections had been held, some dated back to 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPods have been reported to have been overheated, leading to a total of six fires and that four people have experienced minor burns.
The Department of Economics of Japan, Trade and Industry (METI) said that it had been aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Department of Commerce and Industry announced that Apple had informed them of 34 more cases of overheating which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "particularly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Department of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands, no injuries were reported in the Commonwealth.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former policeman from the Philippines took Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza used an M16 rifle when he shot at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, but it has been confirmed that at least six people have died so far.
Six hostages, the children and the elders, were released at an early date, and so were the Philippine photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it could prompt maturation of the fetus' lungs.
Xinhua reported Wednesday that government investigators had found the two ‘black boxes' with the plane's audio recordings.
Other athletes also hailed Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on a night with two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong Woman."
Dustin "Gold Dust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as crazy as me...perhaps even more...loves her and is going to slow her down...hopefully she's in a better place."
Based on an opinion poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election, it emerged that the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Temporary Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 campaign for the federal election that she believed that Australia should become a republic upon the exclusion of Queen Elizabeth II's rule.
Thirty-four percent of those who took part in the poll shared this view and wanted Queen Elizabeth to be Asutralia's last monarch.
At most, 29 percent of them thought that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist would swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but as a result of his complaints, question marks have been seen by his form.
He has been unable to take the necessary drugs to get over the pain, as they are illegal in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery by using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Thursday.
Comets may possibly have been a source of deliveries of water to the Earth, along with organic matter that can shape proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets take shape, especially how Earth took shape since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began in his position as governor earlier this month and signed last month a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political talk and nonsense."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the U.S. Aviation Control claims can allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with better precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation facilities have been put in place and trains above ground are not going to stop at Wembley, in addition, parking and parking with transportation are not available on site.
Fears of lack of transportation have hinted at the possibility that the games will take place behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on a formation of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Scientists from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new bird species was developed after only two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, as a result of breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, the inter-earth sparrow and the immigrated cactus finch, Geospiza conirostis.
Gold can be worked out into any formation; it can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be spun into thin thread that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered and rolled out into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it can sometimes be used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make an indicator by using jus of red cabbage.
The coal lights change color according to how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H' in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Stir the two dry powders together and then press them together into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outward layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo had a flush toilet in almost every single house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of the sewage system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China; in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were present together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away you use a satellite.
The satellite that is in space receives the call to so reflect it down again, almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space when the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and sight.
It requires a large rocket that is over 100 feet too high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster opportunities for transport.
It has given us the train, the car, and many other transport units.
Under them, there are more medium-sized cats as a medium-sized prey, ranging from hares to antelope and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat a much more diverse selection of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special job every cat has that keeps them away from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live together in large groups called herds.
Flocks are formed by one to three adult male lions, along with as many as thirty lionesses and their young.
The lionesses are usually related to each other, and are a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion flocks behave very similar to a wolf flock or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
As a particularly flexible athlete, the tiger can climb (albeit not so well), swim, run long distances, and pull with five times the power of a strong human being.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who roar.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but more like a sentence of growling, gaulling words.
Ozelots like to eat small animals. They tend to catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than these.
Scientists believe that ozelots follow suit and find animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing their way to where they have been on the ground.
They have a night vision that allows them to see very well at night, and also move very agile. Ozelots hunt by camouflaging themselves in the environment while wondering about their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) are separated from the main population they came from (such as if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that it is difficult for them to retreat) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they came from.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors which means that the new population will need different features or adaptations to become a strong competitor, than those that they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, they need to continue the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population has begun to adapt to their new environment, causing them to start to become more and more unlike the other population.
Finally, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process species formation, which means the formation of new species. Species formation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen like humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide that humans breathe out (in other words, exhalation).
Plants produce their food from the sun using photosynthesis. They also provide shadow.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant. Without plants, animals would not have survived.
Mosasaurus was at the time a top consumer, so he feared nothing – except for other Mosasaurus.
The long jaw of males was surrounded by more than 70 sharp teeth, and with an extra set in the palate, in other words, there was no way out for those who crossed the road.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a split tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs. He may even have been a cannibal.
He regretted everything that ended up in the water—even giant dinosaurs, such as the tyrannosaurus rex, were of no concern to him.
As most of their food would be known to us, however, the Romans had some unusual dishes for their feast meals, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called sevensows.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate their meals sitting, the rich men liked to have banquets together while lying on the side when they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included food coming to Europe or America from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa and no Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods that was considered their home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to care for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and an inner sanctuary to which only priests had access.
Sometimes separate pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not very important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women did the cooking in the courtyard; shops were only open counters directed towards the street. Stones were used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
In the Norse seals it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and as he travelled further west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Although he made this discovery, there already existed Eskimo tribes residing there at this point.
Although each of the countries was ‘Scandinavian', there were great differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film The National Treasure, you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not correct. Although there is something written on the back, there is no treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one can say for sure who has written it, it is known that the large parchment document (it measures 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) early in its life lap was rolled together for storage.
So it is likely that the listing was simply added as a marking.
The D-Day landings and you following battles had liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not liberated.
It was ruled by the French Vichy regime, the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and independent French forces had liberated the southern part of France, and were heading for Germany.
A civilization you are single culture that is shared by a group of people of a significant size who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin word civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and in a way also defining the size of society.
A civilizational culture insinuates the dissemination of knowledge across multiple generations, a lingering cultural imprint, and fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and failure in becoming known as orderly civilizations.
Throughout the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as its only component—under the decisions of the Confederacy.
Congress lacked any power to be able to impose taxes, and as there was no executive or judiciary, it relied on government authorities, then often uncooperative, to enforce all its decisions.
It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The decisions required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team are the second most successful football team in the world, and were FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in the international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
As a result of the clusters/groups of islands Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geological perspective as an "archipelago."
The beginnings of Taiwan go all the way back to the 15th century when European sailors who passed registered the name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East Indian Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which initiated a transformation of the natives' grain production practices and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwain's western and northern coastal areas, declaring Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the country until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Window.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the first place.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed and the rebuilding process continued to the present day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogic era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital cameras' sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, a bit confusing, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest complete ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats for example) are similar to, or about the same, as this aspect ratio.
The much criticized and often laughed rule that thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while keeping a measure of order in images.
It says that the most effective placement for main subjects is at the intersection of the lines, which divide images into threes vertically and horizontally (see examples).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had bonded European states, despite differences in language and customs.
It had an all-encompassing power that affected everyone from king to ordinary citizen.
One of the most important Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church are there for precisely this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was met.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective when it cut off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade broke with the generally accepted international laws, codified by several small international agreements over the past two decades.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent all ships from sailing into entire sea areas and inflicting damage on even neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most residents were pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the hardship and heartlessness of war during the First World War, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in the city of New York.
He came to the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and an attestation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each step of China and each family in power became a distinct dynasty.
Also between each dynasty there was an unstable age of divided provinces; the best known of these periods were the three kingdoms of the era that took place for 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
Throughout these periods there was fierce warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China's history, thousands of people dying while fighting to sit on the highest seat of the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism and republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not a single ruler.
After the revolution, positions were also open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military when ranking was now based on skills rather than class, as they had been before.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people, from oppressed working classes in other countries, to starting their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters outside his everyday life, often using a mine known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) for brooding.
The mine itself, which survived through time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual decay.
The mine sits on top of the mountains north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, although you know it exists. When you are on the inside of the mine, you are completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen but clear, beautiful cloud above, and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from the inside of the mine.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century before our era, and is one of the many pyramid structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the small pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family member.
The "up-bow" mark looks like a V and the "down-bow" mark like a staple or square is missing on the bottom of it.
Up means you should start at the top and push the arc, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the arc) and drag the arc.
An up-bow usually makes a softer sound, while the down-bow is stronger and more definite.
Feel free to make your own marks, but remember that the markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's nurse, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789, by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a chariot surrounded by a mob of men who shouted and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The mob of men forced the king and queen to have the windows of the carriage completely open.
At one point, a member of the mob held up the head of a royal guard, who was killed in Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines, were paid for by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cost a large part of the expenses, and the interest in bonds embarrassed in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking.
The superprofits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would, of course, constitute the basic achievements of US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, one must understand the context that facilitated the formation of the Order.
The era when these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (A.D. 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages came after the early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas, from technology advancement or the technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific law and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technology itself' development feels a way far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on society that are inherent, rather than socially contingent.
For example, one could say that the motor car will necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable to serve only a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Old age car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads the health care system to discover new techniques for treating injured people.
Romance had a large element of cultural determinism, taken from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time the customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, which were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation for being an epicentre of luxury began in about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
This status was reduced during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of fashion capital, from Constantinople to Paris, occurred.
Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, dress was highly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
Due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop their own style. one of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusaders, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Agriculture for subsistence is agriculture practiced for the production of enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Agriculture for subsistence is a simple, often organic system that uses stored seeds that come from the eco-region combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in agriculture for subsistence and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals, who feel neglected by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive as a result of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and argot.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to highlight the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "wild" or furious. Some wild children have been restricted by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children as a result of their parents' rejection of a child's serious, intellectual or physical difficulties.
Wild children may have experienced child abuse or trauma, before having been surrendered or escaped.
Others have been claimed to be raised by animals; some have been supposed to have lived alone in the open.
When fully raised by non-human animals, children's behaviors (within physical limitations) show almost exactly the same as the current caring animals, such as fear of or indifference to humankind.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, constructivist design learning takes a step further.
Constructive design is not a method of learning, but rather an aid that makes support for individuals who are engaged in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and is intended to set question marks on, boring, and clarifying about procedures that could have been too demanding for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide variety of causes ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to blackmail.
No children should have to grow up in an environment that is not tidy, caring and educational, but they do.
We look at the Child Welfare Regulations as a safety zone for these children.
Our Child Welfare Regulations are intended to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, and stable education, as well as reliable health care.
Foster homes a meant to cover all the necessities that were lacking in the home they were taken away from.
The Internet combines elements from both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet led to several dimensions in terms of the approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for web use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined the audience's reactions to web pages.
The use of video footage has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, movements of the duck lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect whether a person is lying by interpreting the micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand the speech as a result of brain damage, are still able to assess the free spirit correctly.
He even suggests that such skills to interpret human behavior may be shared by domestic animals such as dogs.
Twentieth-century research has revealed that there are two stores of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the repository of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination move variation forward and backward between the two stockpiles with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestion system whose human beings to meet their need for amino acid from the available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most available mortgage resources would have been the proteins available in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest.
In contrast, not only are pet foods (ants, termites, eggs) digestible, but they make a high number of proteins containing all the required amino acids.
Considering all this, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in any way the same way as the chimpanzees in the savannas do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of waking intentionally during your normal sleep period and falling asleep again shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a silent alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find that you are resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known water-driving fluids) before sleep, which will force you to stand up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person sits inside with hangs opposite to the amount of tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own excitement and negativity.
The Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was extended by the Mahayan way of love and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path to all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is god-yoga. Through visualization of various gods, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. At the end of the war, the conflicting systems, processes, and cultures led to the countries' unity.
By two years of the end of the war, the two were allied enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and was fought for real, by interceptors, on battlefields from America to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish military had already broken down, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along Romanian bridgeheads.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, as over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Commonwealth's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace, the Soviet-Polish non-aggressive Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to carry transport goods is clearly the most efficient way to move large amounts of people and good across oceans.
The job of the marinas has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move human and good, while at the same time, hindering your enemy's ability to move their human and good.
One of the most recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, which attempted to move men and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have managed to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Animal husbandry was started in ancient cultures to have easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were normally kept in flocks that grazed in highlands or other grazing areas, often herded by shepherds who were often children or young – a form of shepherd boys. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wooden railroads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although these rails consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the carriages, to achieve higher speeds and pull heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads that were at the time.
Sleeves were introduced relatively early in order to keep the rails in place, but gradually it was realized that the rails became more effective if they were allowed to dock a little iron on top.
This thus became common, but the iron caused greater wear on the three wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the three wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first rails made exclusively of iron were introduced.
The first known mode of transport is walking. Man, that is, Homo erectus (<0x3D> the erect man), started walking upright two million years ago.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not regularly walk upright.
Two-legged specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to be kinder to the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce incoming burdens to some extent.
This is in many cases the same as treating symptoms, but if we don't just want a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problems and in that way solve them.
It is obvious that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and problems have become greater because of overcrowding and extravagant lifestyles in humans.
After Congress passed the declaration on 4 July, a handwritten draft was signed by the president of Congress, John Hancock, and his secretary, Charles Thomson, sent a few blocks further away to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap broadsides", were printed.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in front of Independence Hall on 8 July.
A copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read the document to the troops in New York on 9 July. On 10 August, a copy arrived in London.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides we know still exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds have many similarities to dinosaurs.
They have feet with shells and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs just like a T-Rex.
So to say all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits — or bits, to use data jargon.
Internal poisoning is not always easy to detect. Symptoms (e.g. vomiting) can be so diffuse that it is not possible to give a diagnosis immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning is an open pill box or toxic household chemicals standing in front.
Examine the label to find out what kind of first aid you should give for the drug in question.
In a formal sense, entomologists use the term "insect" for this group of insects.
This shift stems from old knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that are very well adapted to be parasites on humans.
Both predators and bedbugs are nidicolae animals, which are adapted to live in nests or the host's house.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, that is, the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
According to research, women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not the best for them, or the best for the child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to adopt the baby.
Upon adoption, the biological parents give up their custody rights so that another couple can become the parent of the child.
The main objective of science is to find out how the world works, through the scientific method. This method serves as a guide for most of the scientific research.
An experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Bible, in Latin.
Aristotle's view of everything related to science was what was accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek diminished, the West became ripped away from the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic signals, are documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillation generators that will continue with periods where they go in free cycles, also when there is no external signal present.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading theories that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labeled the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the attacked genetic material, and whether the attacked cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to view the beautiful landscape, including plant and wildlife.
Examples of activities are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Another example is to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people take their car and leave small suburbs to travel to work, while others pass them on their way to work at the place they just left.
In this dynamic transportation back and forth, everyone is in some way connected with, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
The research now suggests that this massive CO2 economy has disrupted the biosphere from the stable state that has supported man's evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems elicit so many complaints, and why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
Traffic flow is the study of the displacement of single drivers and vehicles between two points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows as driver behavior cannot be predicted one hundred percent for sure.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably stable area, so traffic flows are often somewhat stable and can be represented roughly mathematically.
A relationship has been established between the three main characteristics in order to represent traffic flow better: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These conditions are useful when planning, designing and using road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to start flying. The ability to fly made them more easily avoid enemies, and they found faster food and mates.
Most insects have an advantage in that they can fold in the wings backwards along the body.
This means that they have several small places to choose from when hiding from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold in the wings, are dragonflies and 24-hour flies.
Many thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the sun.
Some believed in him, but many believed it quite the opposite, that it was the solar system moving around the Earth, including the sun (and all other stars).
It's no wonder, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, having more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, in some places 9.5 km wide.
All 20 percent of the water that flows out of all the Earth's rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The headwaters of the Amazon River are 6,387 km long, collecting water from thousands of small rivers.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one was ever able to surpass the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and its forward-looking technical execution.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, the smallest independent state in the world with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used during religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from antiquity, as all of these exist in natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements, these four elements being earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma. Although he also created a theory that they change into new substances and form what we see.
Alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are counted as metals. And of course we also have the metals silver and gold.
You can also have alloys consisting of small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so extremely small that there is room for many trillions of them in the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it was invented.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been downgraded to lower status and less used as newer writing methods have been introduced.
People now write messages on computer screens and never need a pencil sharpener.
After all, we can only wonder what is going to happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it requires energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Kind of like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill. When you then split the core up again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to fall apart with little or no influence.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the mares (the dark areas) and thicker under the light areas.
There may be more mares on the nearest side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around figuring out what motivates people, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as we grow up.
Theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want, and what it is in their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the needs hierarchy and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can occur when leaders start hiring colleagues with whom they were previously on the same level. At one end of the spectrum, you have the leader trying to keep being "one of the gang".
This type of leader has problems making unpopular decisions, reprimanding employees, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you have the leader who turns into a person you don't recognize and who feels that he or she has to change everything the group has been doing, and make it his or her own.
After all, it is the leader who is responsible for both ups and downs in the group.
This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups hold the same superior standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual group members often serve as contact points for the nearest physical group.
They often manage themselves more on their own than conventional group members because their groups tend to meet according to varying time zones, which may not be met with understanding of the local leadership.
The fact that the group is indeed "invisible" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual group.
The "invisible group" is the leadership group to which each member reports. The invisible group sets the standards for each individual member.
Why should an organization go through such a time-consuming process as establishing a learning organization? One of the goals you will achieve by putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and creativity can flourish.
One result of this process of an organization working together to cope with an obstacle is that it leads to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must establish a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the examination of cognition, thus narrowing the research area and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the researchers in the research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that can help us understand processes in the brain.
Although "science fiction" provides powerful associations to artificial intelligence (KI), KI constitutes a very important part of computer science when it comes to dealing with acting, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research within KI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this can be control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnoses and questions from customers as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The KI system is now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military and is embedded in several PC apps and video game apps.
Excursions are a big part of all teaching. It is quite often a teacher would like to take the students to places you can not travel by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the largest city in the state; every year they rebuild the site, but keep old versions online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often start blogging with poor grammar and spelling, it usually changes when they get an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to make his writing better to avoid criticism.
Blogging also makes "students be compelled to understand the world around them better". The need to satisfy the audience inspires students to become smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn something outside of the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to material on the Internet, students can define their positions in the context of other people's texts as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada where the two languages are spoken, as well as a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's history and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the northern part houses the untapped and scenic Muskoka, among other things.
All this and more highlights Ontario as what foreigners view as most typically Canadian.
Large areas farther north have quite scattered settlements, and some areas are closest to desert wilderness.
Here is a comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are residents of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a separate continent when it comes to animal and plant life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are linked to France, and known as luxury resorts with great beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it had a profound impact on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism started in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
In the north, the regions are bound by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would regard as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, taken in the arm, etc.
Be determined when you reject men, and don't be afraid to stand on yours (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but left it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the city was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop throughout Morocco.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, including tagine, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of fakes, but everything is for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Congo located far east of the Rwandan border.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, and most of the city streets, especially downtown, were covered by lava.
It is relatively safe in Goma, but if you are travelling outside Goma, you will need to investigate carefully to find out what the situation is in the province of North Kivu with regard to the ongoing conflict there.
The city is also used as a base camp for those who are going to make their way up to Nyiragongo volcano, and it is also the starting point for those who want to see one of the most affordable trips in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
You can use the Boda boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. Regular (local) price is <0x7E>500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with the fact that it is relatively difficult to access, "Timbuktu" is commonly used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a city of much poverty, although rumour makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the city was added to the World Heritage List for sites at risk, due to the threat posed by the desert sands.
It was one of the major stops in Henry Louis Gates' program, Wonders of the African World, which aired on the PBS channel.
The city stands in stark contrast to the cities of the rest of the country, as it is more Arab than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, and to the south is the Crocodile River that forms the border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with different animal and plant life.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa, and it is regarded as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park has nature management fees and entrance fees.
It may also be a good idea to buy a Wild Card, which provides free entry to either selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists consider as the main destination of their visit.
The parade of buildings that make up the silhouette of Hong Kong, has been compared to a glittering bar chart opened by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
You get the best view of Hong Kong if you leave the island and head to the Kowloon beach line on the other side.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on ramparts along the northern coastline.
This was the place the British colonizers took as their own, so if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest swamp belt in the world, and it extends 80 km into the interior of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the part of the forest that lies in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps; they comprise some of the last remaining populations of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, and approximately one-third is covered with water/moorland.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been an animal and plant sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 axial deer in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading to the east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since these buses between districts are often full, it is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts have small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a sloping bridge, stretching over the Oyapock River and connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The Guaraníes were the main inhabitants of what is now called Eastern Paraguay, where they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also farmed for a living.
In the Chaco region, other indigenous groups such as guaycurú and payaguá were also found, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of Indies", emerged as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period which lasted for three hundred years.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of the distinctiveness and identity of the indigenous people.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The largest tournament of the year takes place at the polo courts in Las Cañitas in December.
At other times of the year, tournaments and games can be seen on a smaller scale.
Contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo to find out more about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) at a fixed exchange rate with the British Pound (GBP).
You can change money in the only bank on the islands, in Stanley, on the other side of the FIC West store.
British pounds are usually accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although UK and US currencies may be accepted. Please contact the owners in advance to find out which is an accepted payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Pounds outside the islands, so you should do this before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and in the summer months temperatures of over +30 °C are common.
Winter can be misleadingly cold, with temperatures rarely below freezing, but the combination of wind and high humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no special "rainy" or "dry" seasons; there is roughly the same amount of rain throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild, and you should not feed or disturb the animals.
The Park Service asks you to stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may look, bison, deer, moose, bear, and the vast majority of large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they have not kept sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them the space they need.
In addition, you must be aware that odors attract bears and other animals. Therefore, you should avoid bringing or cooking food that smells, and the clay must be kept clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, a special situation arose at the port, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave it.
All ships sank, with the exception of a British sailing warship, with nearly 200 American and German lives lost.
During the struggle for independence, organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the murder of its leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As a result of Auckland stretching between two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
North coastal beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe conditions for swimming, and most also have shades from Pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast.
The local beer is called "Number One" and is not a complex beer, but good and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to obtain, but New Zealand and Australian wines will probably be a better choice.
Tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to get if you want to be on the safe side.
A "flat white" would be distant to an Australian: a small black coffee is espresso, a cappuccino is served with plenty of cream whistle (not milk foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate tends to hold Belgian standard. Fruit juices are expensive but good.
Many trips to the reef are arranged throughout the year, and damage to the reef is rarely caused as a result.
However, it is wise to follow the advice of the authorities and follow all signs and warnings.
Cube jellyfish can be found near beaches and estuaries from October to April north of the small town of 1770, and occasionally at other times of the year.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, travelers can be assured that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, for example at a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer package tours that include breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and sometimes with combined flight and hotel packages.
It is also possible to keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or arrange other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants choose to camp at the festival, and most participants believe this is an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to what is happening, you must arrive early to get a tent site near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage has run out, there may be other places at the festival where music is played until late at night.
Some festivals have their own camping areas for families with young children.
If you are going to cross the Baltic Sea in winter, you should check where the cabin is located. Some will hear it extra well when the vessel passes through the ice. It is very noisy.
A cruise to Saint Petersburg gives you some time in the city. There is no requirement for a visa for cruise passengers (check the conditions).
Casinos do what they can to ensure that guests spend as much time and money as possible there. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and it can be difficult to find the way out.
There are often special prices for food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in the mood and stay.
Some places offer free drinks with alcohol, but intoxication, as is known, weakens judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at higher latitudes or over mountain passes must know that you can meet on snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you cannot drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard there can be so much snow in a short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility may also deteriorate due to the snow that valleys or blows on the route, or when dogging or forming ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest travel attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
In popular use, the term safari refers to traveling on land to see the amazing African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to go close to the cars, and standard equipment will provide good views.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes a little shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "footing") involves hikes that can last for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in different parts of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, as they also hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the Games were postponed, it could be difficult.
The cancellation rules vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation rules based on the coronavirus do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2,500 JPY and 130,000 JPY, with the most common tickets costing around 7,000 JPY.
Wet clothes can get drier if you iron them. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards for loan, although you won’t always find these in your room.
If you can't borrow an iron, or if you don't want to use stroked socks, try using a hair dryer.
Be careful not to make the fabric too hot (which can cause the fabric to shrink or in the worst case make a mark in it).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, keep boiling the water for one minute, while in others you have to boil it for several minutes.
Filter efficiency varies, and if you don't feel completely safe, consider buying bottled water with a seal from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with from home.
Pests can destroy food, irritate or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans by force, do not normally qualify as pests.
In customs and duty-free trade, goods exempt from customs duties and taxes can be purchased at certain locations.
Travelers en route to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers very challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, and you often have to drive through desert forested areas.
If you are not accustomed to driving on country roads, keep your head cool when encountering steep ladders, narrow roadways, and sharp turns, which are typical of this route.
Speed limits are noticeably lower than earlier and later road sections, usually 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph), and it is even more important than otherwise to follow these.
Oddly enough, mobile coverage is much better here than at many other stretches along the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite powerful and varied, as is the case with their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruited pastries are common, where apples are added to pastries year-round, while cherries and plums are used in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. For such popular cakes, a cup of strong coffee is suitable.
If you want a small but powerful pastry, try what, depending on the area you are in, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry dishes are based on herbs and spices mixed with either meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be either "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is often used in curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term covering a variety of regional dishes found throughout the country.
However, if used without additional signs, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simple spicy dishes. The most dominant flavors that Javaneses like best are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups provide support for the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but this can be a safety risk, because the feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse, but his foot is stuck in the stirrup, he may be dragged behind if the horse runs off guard. A number of safety measures can ensure that this risk is minimized.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and fairly narrow sole.
Some halls, especially English halls, also have a safety mechanism that allows a stirrup to eject from the hall if it is pulled backwards by a rider who is about to fall off.
The Cochamó Valley – the premier climbing destination in Chile, known as Yosemite in South America, with many large granite walls and cliffs.
Climbers from many parts of the world continuously create new routes in the walls, offering endless possibilities.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports where you slide down snowy terrain on skis or snowboards attached to your feet.
Skiing is a great travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski crossings", who plan the entire holiday trip around skiing in a particular place.
The idea behind skiing/running is very old. Hole paintings illustrating skiers, are dated back to 5000 BC!
Slalom as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This is also called wilderness skiing, cross country skiing or mountain skiing.
The activity is related to, but does not normally involve randonee skiing on the high mountain or peak hikes in steep terrain, requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail you are going through as if it were a long walk.
Under good conditions, you will be able to leave behind greater distances than if you walk, but only very rarely it goes as fast as cross country skiing in groomed trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but which has many independent states. Usually when travelling through several countries, visa applications and passport controls have to be repeated.
But the Schengen area functions almost like one country in this context.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through multiple passport controls.
If you have a Schengen visa, this works the same way. You do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries separately, thus saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, and the age limit may be lower in e.g. North America compared to Europe.
Household products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the community, and the culture around the business is also important for many with other occupations.
Traditionally, not all Sami have been involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but have lived from fishing, hunting and the like, and they have mostly used reindeer as a draft animal.
Today, many Sami work in modern industries. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, i.e. Samiland.
Although widely used, especially by non-Romanian people, the word "Gypsy" is often seen as noisy due to its association with negative stereotypes and wrong perceptions of the Romani people.
If travel advice has been created for the country you are visiting, this may affect your health insurance or cancellation insurance.
It may also be a good idea to check what advice lies outside from authorities other than your own, but remember that their advice is intended for their residents.
For example, U.S. citizens in the Middle East may come up with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The councils are only a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
What is presented here is often clear, general and simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage, serious societal consequences, or loss of life.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Severe winds, hail, extreme precipitation and fire are forms and effects of extreme weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, cloud pumps, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena include heavy blizzards, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers should also stay informed of the risk of bad weather affecting the area, as this may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that may be regarded as a war zone should receive professional training.
With an internet search for "Hostile environment course" or "conflict management course" you will probably find the address of a local company.
A course normally covers the situations discussed here, in more detail, and usually with practical exercises.
A course normally lasts 2–5 days and involves role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes gun training.
There are several books and magazines on how to survive in the wilderness, but there are few publications on war zones.
Travelers who plan to have sex-correcting operations performed abroad must ensure that they have valid documents for their return home.
It varies how willing the authorities are to issue passports without stated gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender.
In addition, the willingness of authorities abroad to accept these documents varies.
Search for security controls has also become far more intrusive in the aftermath of September 11, 2001.
Prior to the operation, trans people probably can't expect to get through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Outgoing currents are currents of water from waves that have broken against the beach and retreat, often at reefs and the like.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper corridors, and here a rapid flow out towards deeper water can form.
Most people die as a result of fatigue while trying to swim back towards the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, swimming back is no harder than normal.
Try to aim for a place where you will not be caught by the current again. Alternatively, depending on what you can do, and if someone has spotted you, you might want to wait for someone to rescue you.
Reverse culture shock can come faster than culture shock (fewer wheatbread days), and this can last longer and be more powerful.
Those who have been traveling and who have had a tendency to adapt to the new culture may have been given extra weight when they have to adapt to their own culture again.
When they return home from living abroad, they have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits they already had.
When they travelled abroad, people were probably patient and accommodating at first, since it takes some time for travelers to adapt in a new country.
Everyone may not be as patient and accommodating when the travelers return home, but this is probably so important.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most exciting in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in still before the show starts.
Usually you hear the sounds of tourists and sellers. The history of the sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx forms a backdrop and stands as the narrator of a long history.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations, with the largest number of stations, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the overflowing caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular and natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula and borders the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains on this side of the peninsula merge into the plateau, but reappear later to form a 360 km range in the form of the Ellsworth Mountains, where the Minnesota Glacier takes place between.
The northern part, the Sentinel Range, has the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which has a peak that rises 4,892 meters above sea level.
In remote locations where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is usually not a good replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have a clear view of the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including recreational craft, and during expeditions in need of external data and voice services.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a year off is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among school students who have completed a course of study and can take a year off before starting university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, a course abroad during the free year can give you better chances to take higher education in your home country.
Usually, a tuition fee must be paid to enroll in such educational programs.
Finland is a great boating destination. "The land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and the coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and largest lakes are certainly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak for a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat to every seventh or eighth person.
This is similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g. the number in the Netherlands is one to forty).
Most regular cruises in the Baltics have a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for two full days, but that you go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only disembark when taking part in excursions arranged on the trip, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin in Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
It can be scary to travel by plane for people of all ages and with different backgrounds, especially if they have not fled before or have experienced something traumatic.
There is nothing to be ashamed of. It is not so different from fear and aversion to other things, as many people have.
For some, understanding more about how airplanes work, and what happens during a flight, can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not having control.
Bodfirma is well paid to deliver things quickly. Time often means a lot when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the large companies have their own aircraft, but for other routes and smaller companies this was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, it could have taken several days of unloading and customs on some routes.
The only thing that worked to get them through faster was to send them as checked baggage. The airline's regulations do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you get in.
It's just coughing up a pile of banknotes (or most preferably having your company do it for you) if you want to fly in first class or business class.
This is not cheap, and as a rule of thumb you can expect to have to pay up to four times more than normal economy class price for business class, and eleven times more for first class.
There is generally no point in looking for cheap business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B by air.
The airlines know that there is a particular group of air passengers who are willing to pay very much in order to travel somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic where there have been many ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistria Republic in eastern Moldova with its own government and currency, but this is not recognized by any of the UN member states.
Economic cooperation has been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
<0xC4><0xB0>zmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of around 3.7 million. The city has the second largest port after Istanbul and is a very good transport hub.
What was once the ancient city of Smyrna, is now a modern, developed and busy commercial city centre that surrounds a large bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The wide streets, glass buildings and modern shopping centers feature traditional red roof tiles, an 18th-century square and ancient mosques and churches, although the atmosphere of the city is more marked by Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard you can see interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some tombstones.
It is worth strolling around the imprisoned village for half an hour.
To the north and within easy distance lies the romantic and fascinating village of Sintra, which became known to foreigners when Lord Byron so brilliantly conveyed its grandeur.
Scotturb Bus No. 403 runs regularly to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north you can visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (holy place), where Mary revealed herself several times, stories that are known all over the world.
Remember that you are simply visiting a mass grave and a place that means infinitely much to a large part of the population of the world.
There are still many men and women who live today and survived the time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked their way here, both Jews and others.
The place deserves to be shown dignity, awe and respect. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not destroy the site by drawing or writing on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, because according to the law it is the official first language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in connection with public transport and other services.
Regular messages on the metro are said only in Catalan, while unscheduled interruptions are announced by an automated system in a number of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
The Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.
Although it is often a misconceived stereotype, you will do best in Paris by behaving in the best way possible, like one who is "bien élévé" (well raised). Then it will be much easier to get around.
An apparently brusque outer disappears quickly in the Parisians if you are fundamentally polite.
Plitvice Lakes National Park contains a lot of forest, mainly beech, spruce and conifers, and has a mixture of alpine vegetation and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly wide selection of plant communities due to the range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes.
In the area there is also an extremely large variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and tiur, along with many more common species.
Women visiting the monasteries must wear skirts that cover their knees, and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most of the monasteries lend shawls to women who have not thought about this, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Likewise, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
This is also possible to borrow from the collection at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable using them. The sizes are suitable for all men!
Majorcan cuisine, as in similar areas of the Mediterranean, uses a lot of bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) as well as olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli. This is bread with olive oil, tomato and available flavors such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Any noun as well as the word Sie (De) always starts with a capital letter, even if it is in the middle of a sentence.
In this way, some verbs and objects can be distinguished more easily.
It also makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated because one has to find out whether a verb or adjective is being used in noun form.
The pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, since pronunciation varies based on the vowel that follows.
Also, be sure to pronounce r and r differently: Caro means dear, while carro means wagon.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, this introduction to grammar can teach you a lot about Persian grammar and how you can understand sentences better.
If you know a Romance language, it will naturally be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But it's easy for those who know a little Spanish to quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that you don't have to study it except.
Observatory built before modern times is largely obsolete today and remains as a museum or educational building.
Since light pollution was not a problem at the time, we usually find them in cities or university campuses where they are easier to get to than those built in modern times.
Today's modern research telescopes are often huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossoming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where the plum flowers were the preferred flowers.
In Japan, the first celebrations of the cherry blossom were arranged by the emperor, and they were only for him and other members of the aristocracy in the emperor's court.
Plants look best when in a natural environment, so do not fall for the temptation to "just take one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formal garden, "take one specimen" is guaranteed to be a reason to show you away.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, and it is easy to navigate, and you can get almost anything after you arrive.
However, when you live in a tropical climate only a few degrees north of the equator, you have to cope with both heat (continuously) and strong sun (when it is cloudless, which is more rare).
There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional cemetery of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes all the way to Hebron and not just the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for your holiday.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, take a cruise to interesting places on the Danube or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also the starting point for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians throughout the world have embraced many of the traditions of the holiday.
It is a tradition to be awake on Easter night and watch the sunrise in the open air.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it might as well be a spring and fertility ritual that has roots to pre-Christian times.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Eve Saturday evening on Easter weekend, where the congregation often breaks into the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
Any animal that came to the islands originally, came swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, the mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, several mammals have been added, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, where the sun does not rise above the horizon.
Then there are good conditions to be able to see the northern lights, since the sky is dark more or less all day.
As the population is spread out beyond the areas and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to look at the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than people from the West are used to.
Dress is standard business outfit, and employees address each other by surname or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, and emphasis is placed on group efforts rather than praise of individual achievements.
Employees often need to get approval from the superiors for all decisions to be made, and they are expected to follow instructions from the superiors without asking questions.
