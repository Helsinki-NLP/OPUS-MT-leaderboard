Crying at the World
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland has gone well and cries and calls in the wild are beginning to attract people all over the world.
“Yours own the riddle, I need Iceland,” a woman in the big world said in comments on an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another viewer says he will keep Iceland in his heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she must get to Iceland as soon as possible, since her fiancé lives there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States and expects to have to wait a few more months.
Another viewer asks if the hiking route to Iceland is good, because there are no planes.
It doesn’t matter if it comes from another time zone.
Egill <0xC3><0x9E>ór<0xC3><0xB0>arson of the advertising agency Peel, who came to do the advertisements together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says receptions have been hopeful again.
“I came across many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already starting to set a record.
Basically, this is about creating PR values, that is, getting foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in some seven hundred media outlets around the world, covering a total of over two billion people.
The value of this report is valued at ISK 1.8 billion.
That's not bad."
The main market is usually the United States, and the campaign has gone very well there, even though the Americans are not on their way to the country soon.
According to Egils, well-known market areas such as Denmark, the UK and Germany have also taken advantage of, such as Russia, which will come as a pleasant surprise.
Then there was a reaction from foreign regions, such as India, which was not specifically addressed.
“These ads have travelled far beyond what we expected,” says Egill, who may have seen the content on YouTube by more than four million people.
“I couldn’t have asked for a better start.”
The pictures at the opening were taken by <0xC3><0x81>rni S<0xC3><0xA6>berg, photographer of Morgunbla<0xC3><0xB0>i<0xC3><0xB0>, during the filming of advertisements with the title "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The tours took place wide and wide, such as on the School Guard Trail in Reykjavík, in Reynisfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, by Skógarfoss, on Sólheimajökull and in a cave at Hjörleifshöf<0xC3><0xB0>i.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll <0xC3><0x93>lafsson at Skoti Productions and the filmmaker <0xC3><0x93>ttar Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason.
The film stars Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders took part in the production of the advertisements, but at the same time as the recordings took place in South Iceland, there was another group in West Iceland and the West Fjords.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first item in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but the aim is a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic Agency,” says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone extremely well.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to.”
Sprengisandur: Discuss the situation in the labour market, pension funds and many more
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister for Social Affairs and Children, will be attending Sprengisand, which starts at 10 a.m. today.
He is also Minister of Labour and discusses the position in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also discusses rural issues and migration to a country that has gone badly and has been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E>ór Ingólfsson, Chairman of VR, will also take part in the show, which will discuss his criticisms of pension fund investments and present ideas that the trade union movement and employers should withdraw from the boards of directors in order to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
<0xC3><0x8D>var Ingimarsson, a tourism professional in East Iceland, and <0xC3><0x81>rnhei<0xC3><0xB0>ur Jóhannsdóttir, Director of the Nordic Market Office, will discuss the status of tourism in the countryside.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading predictor of what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, which starts at 10am.
This is what it looks like 25 years later.
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in all kinds of teen shows.
She won worldwide fame for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has happened to her lately, but she got to look over the past few days and comment on Clueless on Australian television.
Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009, said she was a great person.
“I have to admit that I built my character mostly on girls I met in school who weren’t good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," Donovan said of his play in Clueless.
He didn't want to leave the police station after a night's sleep.
Around 50 cases came to the police in the capital area today and says in the police diary that the cases have been diverse.
The day at the police station at Hverfisgata began with the police having to intervene by a man who had then been recently released from a prison cell after staying there because of drunk driving.
The man did not want to go away after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to go away.
The man earned his continued stay at the police station because of his conduct.
A man was arrested in the morning on suspicion of burglary in a company in Kópavogur.
Police also had to intervene two men in Brei<0xC3><0xB0>holt due to reports of a body attack.
A woman who was eating at a shopping mall in Kópavogur could not pay the bill after a meal and was therefore called to the police.
Theft of a car was also reported in the city centre this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked at her for a moment, and she was taken with a hand.
The car was not found.
The Curse of the Joy Group - The Terrible Destiny of the Gleestjerna
The theorem has gained ground on the Internet that a curse rests on the season of The Joy Band, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the past few days, becoming the third lead actor of the series to die far in advance.
The Glee series is a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The series covered the so-called joy band of teenagers in high school, their love and fate.
It was not always taken out with the selves to be in the band of joy, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the shows seemed to overcome every situation that came up in their lives.
But outside the scenes, a great deal of tragedy has ravaged the actors and staff of the show, so much so that theories have aroused that the curse rests on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera starred Santana Lopez in the series, a cheerleader who didn't call her grandmother everything.
After the season ended, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey, with whom she had her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
Dorsey refused to file a lawsuit, however, and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On 8 July, Rivera was reported missing after her four-year-old son was found drifting alone in a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a lifejacket on board the boat, and he was able to report to the police that he and his mother had stabbed him to swim and Rivera had brought him back into the boat but never returned there himself.
Began an extensive search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area reported that the search had assumed Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.
She is believed to have been hit by a heavy current in the lake and used her last claim to save her son.
Causes of death were recorded drowned by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith starred Finn Hudson in the series, the American football player with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Joy Band to glory and dignity.
Outside of the show, however, Moneith wrestled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his co-workers in the show felt enough, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and seemed to be looking for a better way.
Just two months after he finished his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein was found to be a deadly mixture of drugs and alcohol.
I didn’t think it was a matter of willingness.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerance to drug donors had decreased to such an extent that the dose he had previously tolerated proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was a heavy burden on his colleagues, but his opponent, Lea Michele, was determined to continue the series, devoting them to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling starred as Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow members of the Joy Band, or until he got the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of child pornography.
While searching his home, he found an enormous amount of child pornography, and the matter was soon publicly heard.
It was clear that Salling had already arrived.
He was accused and convicted of his crimes.
He was sentenced to four to seven years’ imprisonment in addition to having to be on a sex offenders’ register and seek treatment for childishness.
Before the judge had decided the sentence, Salling, who was then released on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn’t just the actors who were long gone.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He died in his sleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
The show also featured a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of star Julia Roberts and did not carry the beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of much control and disrespect.
Motes took her own life in 2014 but suffered from severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé in which she said that her mother and sister were responsible for how she was treated.
“My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and assaulting her co-stars at a shooting location and of having an overwhelming stargazer.
Jesse Luken starred in the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a big shock.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
In 2010, unprecedented cyber crooks made nude photos of her and appeared on the Internet.
Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the show and had an affair outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
Playing in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and watch them grow and thrive increases the child’s maturity.
It can also be done indefinitely with flowers as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Spending time with the kids in the park is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
I bought a boat in the 10th grade.
“I don’t think there are many fishermen who work in Iceland’s preschools,” says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, who is engaged in coastal fishing in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter season.
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it’s great to be able to avoid taking out student loans.
The food is also good for me in the winter," says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student who is engaged in coastal fishing this summer.
Axel was the newest to dock at Tálknafjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur when a reporter spoke of him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“The winter I was in the tenth grade, I took boating rights for boats that are under twelve meters long and I bought my boat the summer after I finished elementary school.
I’ve been fishing on my boat ever since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat his name.
Hartmann was an adult when I bought the boat and stopped going to sea, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," Axel says, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
"I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I was fishing.
So I had the boat free at the end of my first summer on it."
But how could a boy have a million and a half to pay in a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“I had put in and collected money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was fishing with him all summer and got my share.
I also put my money into the boat.”
Axel was born in <0xC3><0x8D>safjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, from where all his mother people are, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
“I can fish here in the western area because I have a legal residence with my grandmother in <0xC3><0x8D>safjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur.
I studied in this area with my dad.
I move between the fjords depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire Westfjords.
Although I think it’s best to stay west, I’ve also been fishing around Sn<0xC3><0xA6>fellsnes and beyond.
I have also fished for the south, but preferably greyslip," says Axel, who always speaks one fire early in the morning and says that he sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings for the sky, for hours alone in the ball-sea.
“The internet at sea is good, so I can make calls, listen to podcasts and music.
I don’t mind being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into danger, but it is true that sometimes there has been bad weather, but never a great danger,” says Axel, who is fortunate that he is never sick at sea.
He says the length of the day depends on how the hunt goes.
“I never go fishing more than 14 hours at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, such as the rental quota, but then I’ve been grazing at sea for 24 hours and a half.”
He says the arrangement in coastal fishing allows him to catch 770 kilos a day, which he finds hampering.
“Other restrictions are that I may not fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I may only fish twelve days a month, these four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their hunting days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to calm instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and being able to choose according to their heads.
So the division of areas could also be done because of me, and seawater space that is well located by the fishery should be allowed to enjoy it," says Axel, who draws mostly cod from the salts of the sea on his coastal fishing, but also only swamps and some other species float with.
Axel works during the winter with his university studies at the preschool Núpi in Kópavogur.
“I don’t think there are many fishermen who work in the country’s preschools,” says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily in the preschool.
“I’m stuck there because I think it’s a great job.
I hope that psychology will benefit me in the preschool in the future,” says Axel, who also has a long history of studying business.
Registration Error Prevented Return Asepsis
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in Iceland led to a person residing in Iceland not being called back for sampling.
It is not necessary to register an ID number if the person fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
“This will be checked out this week,” said an expert in the field of health care.
Three infectious diseases were diagnosed at the Department of Virology at Landspitali yesterday.
One of those who proved positive arrived on July 15, two days after the so-called return mitigation rules came into force.
Those who lived in Iceland are then screened upon arrival to the country and again invited for sampling four to five days later.
It was revealed in the afternoon news that the person had, however, followed the old system.
The sample at the border was negative and was not recalled for screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of disease prevention, said in a conversation with a news agency that this could be due to an error in the electronic registration sheet.
If people fill out the registration form in English, it is not a requirement to enter an ID number as it is in the Icelandic version.
First and foremost, it was for foreigners.
Therefore, the person did not receive an automatic invitation to come for sampling.
Kamilla says, however, that many have followed the rules of the return portal even though they have filled in the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been vigilant to send people back for sampling after they arrived in Iceland.
“This week, we will look at ways to make it easier for people to get to know us.”
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been placed in quarantine.
They all went for sampling, but two were beginning to show signs.
The three infections that were detected yesterday are currently being contracted, mostly due to two infections that were reported on Friday.
In both cases, sequencing of Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there is a variant of the coronavirus that has not been found before.
In the second case, the ties have focused on Israel, although it is known that the person who carried the virus to the country had also travelled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should be clear tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
A total of 15 are currently in isolation according to the website COVID. is.
135 are in quarantine.
Four out of five uninfected
Five domestic infestations have been detected in Iceland in recent days.
Four of them are completely offline and, for example, the source of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday has not been found.
Embroidery is still ongoing.
Initially, a third of them were sent into quarantine, but they were reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 are in quarantine due to the new infections detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that infection is detected at sporting events and it has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, Head of Communications at the Civil Protection Department, says it well slowly, as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
“We are constantly urging everyone who lives here that there is a need to maintain an individualised infection prevention system.
We also need to remind people who are holding events that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
“Then we can have an event,” said Johann.
He says that infection can be prevented by maintaining airborne controls.
In addition, the rules and criteria are subject to continuous review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Health and the Directorate of Health are constantly teaching people, is to think about this individualised infection prevention.
Both at home and in service companies.
Let people wash their hands and use alcohol.
This prevents the infection from proceeding," says Johann.
“We need to encourage people to continue on the good road we were on, in order to sustain the results we have achieved so far.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes mellitus 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how hard her father was breathing.
Her father was diabetic and she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was identified on the death certificate as the underlying problem and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same will happen.
Reuters reports that Brumfield’s fears are not without reason.
According to a recent study by the U.S. government, nearly 40% of those who died of diabetes mellitus 2 had been diagnosed as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the proportion rises to half.
The U.S. Department of Disease Control (CDC) surveyed more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious disease specialist at the CDC, says the findings are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 2 and their loved ones.
It was concealed in the slow rate of growth Reuters had a survey done and pointed the answers from the 12 states that corresponded to similar rates.
Ten states, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet begun to report underlying diseases.
“Diabetes was already a slow-growing epidemic.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful age,” said Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American descent, who have also gone worse out of the coronavirus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes is to keep the disease under control with exercise, healthy diet and the help of healthcare professionals.
The coronavirus pandemic, however, has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
In addition, high prices of insulin have forced some to continue to work, risking exposure to the virus.
According to Reuters, the U.S. government may have been aware of the risks that the virus could pose to people with diabetes.
When SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease and in the 2009 swine flu pandemic, this group was at three times the risk of having to go to hospital.
When MERS did this in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could be longer, the epidemic has uncovered a number of previously unknown complications.
“I fear we will see a tsunami problem when this is over,” said Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Association.
Physicians have warned that the coronavirus epidemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetic complications, including kidney disease and dialysis.
Likewise, new research suggests that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in diabetes.
Reuters says researchers are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
A high glucose/lipid ratio in diabetics can also trigger a true “cytokine storm”, as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation which in turn can lead to fatal blood clots.
“It’s all a big puzzle,” says Dela Cruz.
“It all relates to each other.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were offered champagne and then they left the room.”
<0xC3><0x81>srún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason received an unusual request from artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work the artist was putting up in Paris.
“We loved each other, so it wasn’t difficult.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he meets his wife and baby mother, <0xC3><0x81>srún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
“I was very impressed with her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but then I thought it was also unbelievably beautiful.
"I'm still here," he said.
Asrun remembers this as well, since the husband regularly recalls the first meeting.
“I’m always hearing this story.
Last weekend just,” she said, who was also attracted to her husband at the first meeting.
“I felt and feel so much excitement around Atla, which I like.
There’s a lot going on and a lot going on and I’m excited about it.”
Atli says the couple have emphasized in their relationship that they are going their own way.
“We don’t tie our bags to the same knots as fellow travellers.
We avoid the routines that we see around us.”
That’s probably why they took the story from Ragnar Kjartansson, a painter, just with pleasure, even though it was unusual to say the least.
“Our mutual friend Kristín Anna will contact us and ask if we can come to dinner with Ragga and Ingibjörg Ragnar’s wife on Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met the three-eyed on Snaps and had a dessert and each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar who guided them through their plans at an art exhibition he intended to put on at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.
“He had a multi-channel video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
“He said it in a simple way.”
<0xC3><0x81>srún says that he described the work as a banal and decadent scene from the everyday life of Westerners.
“He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last time he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part.”
The senate that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was supposed to show a young middle-class couple to make love in a minimal room.
“This is the beginning and the end of the relationship,” says Atli.
The couple did not know Ragnar much, although they knew about him and he of them "but they knew us and felt fit in this.
They said they didn’t want to talk to people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn’t get the right people, but people who would get sexual masturbation from performing for others.”
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“When we ran out of Snaps, we said, ‘Aren’t we just ready for this?’
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and all his team,” says <0xC3><0x81>srun and Atli.
“It’s all about love and closeness.”
The senate was taken up in a nice apartment on M<0xC3><0xBD>rargatan.
There was a very small film team; a cameraman, Ragnar and a sound player and the couple.
After the recording was turned on, everyone left the room to wait in the car except for Atli and <0xC3><0x81>srún.
“We haven’t decided how we should be.
We were given a few instructions but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unaware of what we are doing and for whom.
It wasn’t a game, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” says <0xC3><0x81>srún.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic," says Atli and <0xC3><0x81>srún agrees.
“We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on vacation in a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved them.
"When Tommi saw it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.
“It’s as much about love and closeness as it is about intercourse itself,” says <0xC3><0x81>srún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and starts to think about it,” says Atli.
“Mom and Dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone that way, but then my dad just sent me a message and said, ‘Nice to meet the little family at the Palais de Tokyo.’”
Do you think the relationship between Atlantis and the world has improved?
“We’re still together, so maybe that’s something.
At least this deepened my relationship with my in-laws," says <0xC3><0x81>srún and laughs.
Asrun himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“I found it a little hard not to be with you but someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was nice to see this because it’s just a scene in a much bigger work and when you saw it with the other works, it’s really cool.
I was able to get away from it and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach,” says <0xC3><0x81>srún, who was pregnant with one of the couple’s children when the tendon was taken up.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to <0xC3><0x81>srúna and Atla in <0xC3><0x81>stursögar on Rás 1.
Swansea wins in the first semifinals
Swansea won 1-0 against Brentford in a dramatic match.
This was the first game of the teams in the final round to reach the English Premier League.
The game took place in Swansea, Wales.
The score in the half was 0-0.
Swansea residents were fined in the 64th minute, while Andre Ayew abandoned the archery of the penalty point and gave up his defense.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, player of Brentford, got the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game less and in the 82nd minute Swansea's players took advantage of the difference.
Andre Ayew then compensated for the vicious crap by scoring a great goal and guaranteed Swansea a 1–0 win.
Swansea lead 1-0 in the duel, but the second game takes place next Wednesday at Brentford home.
5 years since 2009.
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard because he feared for his life.
However, it has not been easy for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the U.S. ambassadorial office in April 2009, the country has been without ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned from office in a strange situation, but Kastljós reported from 2009 that she should have received the Falkaord.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the President’s office saying that she would not be honored by the words.
After she left Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
It took sixteen months for Van Voorst's successor to take office, in September 2010.
Robert S. Connan had been appointed ambassador to the United States, but he did not.
At the time, Loius Ariega had worked in the foreign service for decades.
He then resigned in the autumn of 2013 and took up the position of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then we had a second ambassadorial period.
Robert Barber was approved by the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and came into office shortly afterwards, when no ambassador had been present for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not a diplomat, but a lawyer and a supporter of Barack Obama’s campaign fund.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as is customary with a politically-appointed ambassador.
Trump’s administration was uncommon to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in the Washington administration.
It took two years before the U.S. Congress invited Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to ask him questions and confirm his position as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony at the Congress, he said he had never come to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who has died, had been of Dutch rocks broken.
Gunter is politically appointed, was previously a dermatologist in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the organization, but Adelson is a strong supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to Iceland in May 2019, when no ambassador had been in Iceland since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest in Iceland.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration was nominating people for key positions and that in recent years the work of the U.S. Congress has been very slow, including confirming an ambassador in office.
Since 2009, it has been without an ambassador in Iceland for more than five years.
However, this has not prevented the construction of the embassy which recently opened its headquarters at Engjateig.
The construction is estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but thick security walls surround the building and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador’s sense of security, as he is said to be fearful for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
The former player of <0xC3><0x8D>BV suffered racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former player of <0xC3><0x8D>BV, says he suffered from racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets having come to Iceland.
This is revealed in an interview with Tonny, which appeared on the Ugandan medium Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Iceland, where he played with <0xC3><0x8D>BV, Val and <0xC3><0x9E>rótti in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The captain of the team was in that position, but he also had the shirt number I wanted so I didn’t get either of what I wanted,” says Tonny, who played on the right side of the season with <0xC3><0x8D>BV.
Among the things that Tonny talks about is the racism he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when playing in Europe.
“It happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was being said to me.
Later I heard about it, and then I asked my friend what it was all about.
He then told me that my opponent let racist comments fall on me after I grabbed him.”
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He said he made the mistakes he regretted the most.
Tonny had not been able to make it to Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he then joined Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had stayed longer in Norway I would have had the chance I wanted to have," says Tonny, who hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He believes that the loan to Iceland was due to his dreams of becoming a major team in Europe.
A worm found in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-inch long black worm in the tonsils of a woman who was searching for it.
The doctor pulled the worm out with a tong.
A study found that it was a parasite.
CNN tells us about it.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days before, which are thin meat cuts.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites such as this are often found in raw meat or fish.
In the aftermath of the spread of sushi in the West, cases of parasites spreading to people have increased, according to CNN.
A second wave is about to begin in Europe.
Spain is currently at the forefront of concerns about a second coronavirus wave in Europe, where the government has taken action to curb the spread of the coronavirus epidemic.
In Catalonia, the whole entertainment life has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infection is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action against the spread of infection in Spain, but in the UK all have to quarantine on their return from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned against traveling to Spain.
Infectious diseases are also rising again in France and Germany, where the government is trying to find a balance between curbing the spread of the virus and restoring the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to the rest of the world, with the worldwide incidence of infections reaching 300,000 per day, with the highest rates in America and South Asia.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the number of confirmed deaths worldwide has reached 16 million, and the number of confirmed deaths related to the virus has reached 644,000.
Mosaic Works Finally Gets to Enjoy Its Fullest
In front of the Tollhúsi<0xC3><0xB0> in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large tomb.
And more smaller machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the pavement is a good one, and many are now observing millions of mosaic pieces of art —as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they’ve never seen it before.
At least they didn’t respect it.
The work so far has been somewhat hidden, directly in front there were parking lots that were always occupying.
People stopped there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped off to do their business in the city center.
"Live and diverse public spaces" and "attractive cityscape" are the guiding lights for the renovation of Tryggvagatan that is currently underway.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow the mosaic work of Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ar Helgadóttir at Tollhúsi<0xC3><0xB0> to enjoy the view better.
In front of the work there will be a square and since the area is well to the sun, it is considered suitable as a stay area for pedestrians.
The artwork will be illuminated and the material will now be more enjoyable than before on these 142 square meters.
There will also be small “fog sprayers”, a kind of water sculptures, that offer play and give the area a certain mystery.
In this way, the improvements are described by the City of Reykjavík, which is currently under construction together with Veitur.
Pipelines for water, heating and electricity will be renewed.
Many of them have come into their years, but the sewage and cold water pipelines date from 1925 and have therefore served downtown residents and businesses for nearly a century.
When the road is reopened after construction, cars can drive around it again.
However, it becomes a one-way street and at the same time creates a quieter and more accessible space for pedestrians.
In an article about Tollhúsi<0xC3><0xB0> on the website of the Director of Customs, it is said that the building was commissioned in 1971 and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Due to the harbour damage reaching through the building, 250 square meters of windowless wall surfaces were formed out to the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such a surface would have a negative effect on the overall street image, if special measures were not taken to adorn the appearance of the building.
The parties therefore agreed to expect a permanent work of art to be installed there.
During this time a lot of words were said by Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur Helgadóttir, an artist, says in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic works in Germany and elsewhere.
The decision was made to contact her first before deciding whether or not the work would be contested.
It had often been said that the work would have to reflect life at the harbour, since the harbour had been Reykjavík’s livelihood since it was made.
When she talked to the artist, she had to be drawn to such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before returning from the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur was given the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home she put forward several suggestions for discussion.
She was promptly asked to do the job.
At the same time, it was requested to make a comprehensive agreement with her and the famous artwork company in Germany, Brothers Oidtmann, but Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur had long worked with them on the installation of famous works of art in many parts of Europe.
Contracts were successful and Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur worked on the artwork during the installation of the brothers’ workshop, which was then responsible for the installation of Tollhúsi<0xC3><0xB0>.
The whole work was extremely well done, both by Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ar Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, says the summary.
Ever since, it has endured unkind Icelandic weather.
It took about two years to complete the work, which was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Tollhus work was completed, at the age of 47.
Preparing more institutions to move to the country
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Da<0xC3><0xB0>ason, Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be moved to shore in the near future.
That’s what the minister said on the show “Explosive on the Wave” at lunchtime.
Recently it was announced that the fire department of the Housing and Construction Authority will be moved north to Sau<0xC3><0xB0>árkrók this autumn.
Six experts in the field of fire work at the agency, but none of them intend to follow the agency north, and Landsfélag Fire and Medical Transport has criticized the migration.
“I think we need to take a step further in this direction.
I am preparing for a further step in this direction.
Further transport," said Asmundur.
He is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions about the transfer of public jobs to land, as I was doing with the Housing and Construction Authority,” said <0xC3><0x81>smundur, who also took an example of other institutions that have been transferred to land and were of great importance to communities in Iceland, such as the transfer of Icelandic food insurance to Selfoss.
All the best from the second day of the championship
The 94th Iceland Championships in free sports ended in <0xC3><0x9E>órsvellir in Akureyri today.
There were a few sets on the second day of the race.
An exciting competition was expected in the women’s sledgehammer throw at <0xC3><0x9E>órsvellir, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH put the <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet in the sledgehammer throw in 2014, which lasted until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from <0xC3><0x8D>R improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Iceland Record back earlier this summer and has been in fantasy form lately, but she has tripled the Icelandic record for the rest of the summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injuries and has not recovered today.
She had only one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and set a record at the same time.
Her Icelandic record she set earlier in July is 62.69 metres and she was therefore somewhat out of date.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from <0xC3><0x8D>R had the second best stroke of the day, but she improved her best performance with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men’s category, FH-ing Hilmar <0xC3><0x96>rn Jónsson, Iceland’s sledgehammer, won a safe victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his second last throw and set a tournament record.
His Icelandic record in the industry is 75.26 meters.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>ni Valur Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason, an Olympic athlete and Icelandic champion in a round pitch, won a competition in a ball pitch in <0xC3><0x9E>órsvellir yesterday, but today he competed in a round pitch which is his main branch.
The Icelandic record of Gu<0xC3><0xB0>na Vals is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today, but he had one valid throw that was enough for the 2nd place, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>ardóttir, Iceland’s long jump winner, won the long jump competition with superiority, but Hafdís jumped the farthest 6.25 meters today, which is close to 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the 200 metres women’s race it was the Irish runner Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest, but she reached the goal in 24.04 seconds, while her Icelandic record in the art is 23.45 seconds.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri, but she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 m race and in the 4 x 100 m bidding race and then also in the 4 x 400 m bidding race today.
In the men’s category, Kolbeinn H<0xC3><0xB8><0xC3><0xB0>ur Gunnarsson from FH was first to finish in the 200 metres race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of <0xC3><0x93>liver Mána Samuelsson from <0xC3><0x81>rmanni.
Like Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg Jóna, Kolbeinn Hö<0xC3><0xB0>ur won gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 metres race.
Not getting a fine for $27 million Bitcoin harvest
The Overtax Committee has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who demanded a fine on a person for negating his financial income resulting from the sale of the Bitcoin electronic currency.
The Committee concludes that the Director of Tax Investigation had not provided clear reasons for the need to impose a fine on the person.
The Committee’s ruling states that the Director of Tax Investigation considered the man to have filed materially incorrect tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have miscalculated his capital gains resulting from the sale of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency of 27 million, either deliberately or out of gross negligence.
A man should be punished for his conduct.
He refused to do so in a letter to the committee.
In 2016, he sold 27 million coins.
He would have had her with a gravedigger in 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and expensive with a normal home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the coins, the tax execution for such a sale had been seriously unclear and unpredictable.
It would not have been possible to expect ordinary citizens to be aware of such measures on tax returns.
He had not intended to avoid paying tax on the crop and would have accounted for his asset on a statement as a deposit in a foreign exchange account.
He would have asked both experts and the Director of Taxation how this was done, but without success.
He believed that he needed to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear opinion on.
The man therefore considered it right that his taxes for these two income years should be re-determined and stressed, but otherwise not punished.
He said he had been working in Iceland and had been paying taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He never intended to escape his duties in an unreasonable way.
The demand for a fine would be all-moderate and would plung him into debt.
Brynjólfur says, “This man understands what football is”
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been a lot between the teeth of people, but also impressed by his performance of what is a season with Brei<0xC3><0xB0>ablik in the Pepsi Max league.
There will be lights in the fire line tonight when they receive <0xC3><0x8D>A in live broadcast on St<0xC3><0xA5><0xC3><0xB0>ur 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur will then take a play ban for four reminders during the season and will therefore not play with a new haircut as in the summer games so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his head before the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
“I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but talking about the character, this one was a bit more trying in the game.
He did not hide.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if there was anyone going to finish this game, I thought he would do it or make it," said Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Benediktsson of Pepsi Max.
“I want to be here for the people.”
“It’s hard sometimes to figure out what position he’s in.
He looks a bit out on the left when it starts to play, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Hjörvar Haflidason.
<0xC3><0x9E>orkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjolf is a real entertainer and is delighted to have such a colourful man in the league: “No one disputes that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and to be always ready to meet and answer in interviews.
“There are a lot of people who are very busy with him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“I am an entertainer.
I want to be here for the people and enjoy it.”
People are reading the interviews with Brynjolf, people are paying in and watching what’s next on his hair.
“This guy is just a genius,” he said.
The player says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in contact with a few teams in the B-League"
Tobias Thomsen, Pepsi Max’s player, appears to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the case.
Tobias wants to get the start of the season in his home country, but for that he first needs to terminate his contract with KR where the Danish league starts before the Icelandic chance.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and have shown a lot of understanding," Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a number of teams in Division B and will probably switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There aren’t many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay my contract at KR.”
Then he says that he probably needs to take on a reduction in wages in Denmark.
“Companies in Denmark have probably experienced more of the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Bjartmar's wheelbarrow has recovered a wheel for millions - Now responds separately after review DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had an interest unlike most others.
He fires up and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name "wheelwheeler" for this reason.
Yesterday there was a lot of confusion when a man published an account of his interactions with Bjartmar.
You then referred to a discussion on Facebook group of Vesturb<0xC3><0xA6>jar where it was stated that Bjartmar took the man to talk in Austurvellir and said the scooter could be stolen.
There was no other way to read from the original writings of the electric shuttleman than that Bjartmar was the thief.
The text has now been edited on Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial news of the case is not at all descriptive of what really happened yesterday in Austurvellir.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victims of electric shuttles that these were truly their own electric shuttles.
The information was given to the alleged owner by another person, but the information was found to be incorrect, Bjartmar said.
“I looked at the guy and found out about the shuttle, with information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and was searched for.
I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him getting ready to drive on the shuttle, I decided to hit him to talk to him.
The owner was sure of his fault and so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I am very good at such a thing, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word from me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric shuttle immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
"Yes," said Bjartmar, "let's just get it straight."
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.
Later, the rightful owner of the electric shuttle told his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous story.
In this more than a year that Bjartmar has been practicing this practice, he says he can count the times he came up against people on the fingers of one hand.
“I have had peaceful relations with the hardest men in Reykjavík,” Bjartmar said, pointing out that bike thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters in society, addicts, mentally ill people and other people who are on the streets for some reason.
“The addiction is a hard master and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, unfortunately the theft of such liquid assets is an easy way to achieve that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My relationship with these people is so good that I’ve got a lot of good people on my team.
There are examples of people who have taken treatment and then turned to me and helped me with what I’m doing,” he says.
In general, Bjartmar’s communication with bikers is courteous.
Some know about him and what he is doing, and offer peacefully to show him receipts, bicycle numbers, and so on.
Bicycle theft is a major problem that has not been addressed.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police are even starting to point people to talk to him because of stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar dislikes DV’s previous news coverage and claims that there is no self-appointed police force in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he has not yet come to a halt with his actions, and if this is not first and foremost the role of the police, says Bjartmar so certainly be.
“Of course the police are supposed to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are simply not doing this.
I have, for example, watched police officers run away from a huge pile of stolen wheels.
She’s very straightforward in these matters.”
“When the cops aren’t doing anything about this, and it’s just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this area, why not?”
He says he has achieved so much success in having stolen wheels, that sometimes he encounters his "clients" on the street that they just have the right Bjartmari wheels they had previously recovered.
The time Bjartmar has called for police assistance has prevented her from attending.
"It just doesn't work with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the bike owners' fault," Bjartmar said, regretting that the victims of bicycle theft have to suffer for the police's emptiness in this area.
The success of Bjartmar is not shared.
There are many stories of people thanking Bjartmari for bringing back his possessions to them.
Bjartmar himself says he has long lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts probably run into millions, if not millions.
Electric weighing, electric bicycles and electric shuttles are heavy, but electric bicycles can cost less than half a million.
Bjartmar works day by day at kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a community.
His bike search is therefore an unpaid job that he does in his free time.
Long shadows and long shadows
2019 was a big birthday year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Although officials had received a pension from the King of Denmark since the 19th century, in 1919 a pension fund for officials was established, which eventually became the pension fund for all public servants.
The basis for the current pension funds for general wage earners was then laid by general collective agreements on the labour market in 1969, which provided for a work-related pension fund with mandatory membership and a full-fledged fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974 a law was passed on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to grow afterwards.
The pension system of wage earners was not the only radical change that the labor movement of the 20th century pushed forward with its wage struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar way in historical strikes in 1955, and the organization gradually gained its claims for sickness entitlement and sickness fund, substantial holiday entitlements, shortening of working hours, improvements in housing, and more as a major replacement.
All these rights cost a great and rigorous struggle, but proved, after all, to be much greater and more lasting than the increase in the amount of money in the salary envelope, which disappeared just as hard in the hit of inflation that characterized the post-war period and until 1990 as many remember.
The creation of a public pension fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although it was finally agreed that the funds would in fact be the property of fund members, the trade union movement had to agree that their boards of directors should appoint representatives of employers and fund members equally.
In the next few years after the foundation of the funds, the demand for the majority of workers in the board of the funds was often discussed in the unions of employees, but it never came to fruition, and therefore we still have the abnormal arrangement that the representatives of the fund members are not in the majority of the boards of the funds.
Article 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on compulsory insurance of pension rights and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
In the first paragraph, it is stated that “the pension fund shall be guided by the interests of the fund members.”
It is also stated in paragraph 5 that “a pension fund shall set ethical standards for investments.”
The shareholder policy of the Pension Fund for Merchants includes, inter alia, the following provisions, following the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations Principles on Responsible Investment, together with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the West Sea and Europe.
The rules discuss how focusing on environmental and social issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to the improvement of investment performance of portfolios.
In this way, the interests of investors and the goals of society in a broader context are brought together.
LV believes it is important that companies, especially those listed on the stock market, adopt public policies on: to implement good governance in terms of social responsibility and environmental issues.
The pension fund Gildi, which has the country's largest funds, has set a "policy of responsible investment" and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all recalled here as an introduction to the latest fashion word in Iceland, "shadow management".
Since the word is new in the case, it is not hoped that it has been defined in full, but I think the following definition is now "most taken": Shadow management is when a leader of a trade union says in the media that he intends to send the representatives of the union to the board of directors of the pension fund a recommendation or instructions on how they should take a position in relation to a decision.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they shall be removed from the Board at the earliest opportunity.
If the leader does not report this in the media and does not talk about resignation, then it is not “shadow management” as such communication between people is of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I ask the reader to consider which way he feels “darker.”
In particular, there are two men who have tried to formulate this definition when this is written, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
There are two journalists, Hör<0xC3><0xB0>ur <0xC3><0x86>gisson, and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir Jónsson, the Governor of the Central Bank.
The reason for both of them came about after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company’s contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants, and Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E>ór Ingólfsson, Chairman of the Reykjavík Chamber of Commerce, issued a recommendation to the company’s shareholders in the board of the Pension Fund for Merchants not to support a possible purchase fund.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and afterwards Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendations, which were of course based on Boga’s decision.
Nonetheless, they saw Har<0xC3><0xB0>ur and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir reason to discuss the matter in the Friday newspaper Fréttabla<0xC3><0xB0>i<0xC3><0xB0> with big words about shadow management, violations of the law and a great need for changes in the law.
There, small pigeons were indeed supposed to roll a heavy load, even though the blessed pigeon had been in a state of disconnection and had also been quickly wiped out.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the matter itself at the end.
I’ve been looking at some of the things in the law that relate to this issue.
This means that the fund boards must take care of the interests of fund members and have ethical standards in investments, and these points are further elaborated in the Articles of Association of both Gildi and the Pension Fund for Merchants, as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look solely at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.
That would be a very dangerous policy, and it would not be necessary to look long for examples of this in the past, as large loans from banks and funds have flowed to immoral adventurers and environmental pollution, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on a slippery slope when he came up with the idea of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the company’s goodwill in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he looked at it and pulled it back.
Time will reveal whether it is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be considered responsible to fund members at the end of the year.

One of the infected did not have a return infectious disease.
One of the three who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic States on 15 July last, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who, however, does not normally reside here and was therefore not given clear instructions on how to carry out so-called return control after arrival in Iceland and go for a second sampling a few days after arrival.
He got a negative from the screening at the border.
“But he is in Icelandic society and is actually going to go to that resort,” says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert in the field of prevention at Landl<0xC3><0xA6>k and deputy surgeon during his summer vacation, in a conversation with Fréttabla<0xC3><0xB0>i<0xC3><0xB0> today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the ID number is not registered then you will not be invited automatically to the second sample.”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he actually resides abroad, but because of his connection in the country as an Icelander, he should have preferred to use it in Icelandic.
But he did not realize this.
“When the ID number is not recorded, you will have to seek it yourself to be included in the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seems to have realized that this was the right way," says Kamilla.
“So it’s clear that we need to strengthen the information about this while we find some way to make an automatic preaching system even if Icelanders don’t register their ID number.
Or to make it somehow clearer who are the participants in Icelandic society in the registration system,” she explains.
Fortunately, however, the few around the person on arrival in the country, even though he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, remain an Icelandic citizen.
Only six have been sent into quarantine since he was diagnosed yesterday, and all six were in contact with him.
They will be sampled, but two of them are beginning to show signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man got a negative from his sampling at the border on July 15.
Kamilla says he was probably so newly infected with the virus that she had not yet been able to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
She does not, however, want to rule out that the man has been infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
“It’s not entirely possible to say that this is definitely an imported infection because it’s been a long time since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused a little bit of trouble in connection with the sporting events.”
She says that is very unlikely because of how few people are around here.
“It’s actually very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but she points out that this cannot be ruled out until the Icelandic genetic analysis has sequenced the virus in the human body.
“If we get a virus type that hasn’t been seen here before, it’s almost certain he’s brought it to the country.”
Firearms and bombs fired on protesters
There was a clash between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Protestants used pepper spray and immortal grenades, but Protestants broke windows and set fire to them.
Fifty-five protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racism were protested in the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city’s courthouse.
The police said the protests were unrestful and there was a conflict between groups of protesters and police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police in August last year, was the least of the protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of officers gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police at her home last March.
The group carried firearms and marched in groups to a closed intersection where the police related the group from a group of protesters and also carried firearms.
Seventy-five people were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white bartender in May.
It’s not the game that defines our season.
Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r does not want to make too much of the importance of the game at Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea do not lose to the Wolves, Solskjaer and his men finish in 5th place and lose the Champions League.
However, they still hope to get to the Champions League by winning the European League next month.
“We haven’t reached the end.
"If we get a point against Leicester, I think people will say we haven't had a bad season," Solskjaer said.
“But no matter what happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot to do to catch the two teams above us,” Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
It’s clear that people’s nerves are getting thin at 3 p.m. today, but Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r tried to pretend that every other game was in question.
“If you want to be part of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is where the company is based.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is ours to take advantage of it," Solskjaer said.
“It’s not the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results don’t define our season, we’ve already had many moments that define this season.”
“The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I think that overall we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than last season,” Solskjaer said.
65,000 infections per day
A total of 65,490 new coronavirus infections were detected in the United States, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the West Sea since the outbreak in Iceland.
900 people died from the virus yesterday, but in the last four days there were more than 1,000 deaths per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, the number of deaths from the virus will rise to 175,000 on August 15, according to a prediction by the U.S. Department of Disease Control.
Fear the second wave of the epidemic
Spain’s government is now trying to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both Thursday and Friday.
No more people have been identified in one day since early May, and the news comes at the same time as the Spanish begin lifting one of the strictest curfews in Europe.
As a result, the British authorities now oblige passengers arriving from Spain to quarantine on their return.
A week ago, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation is worst in Catalonia in the northeastern part of Spain, where the government has resorted to broader restrictions to try to contain the pace of growth.
In the capital of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and wave houses will be closed at midnight.
A curfew is now in force for 200,000 residents in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that Britain’s decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected by the epidemic.
Tui, the UK’s largest travel agency, cancelled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but little interest seems to be in returning to a massive curfew that has widely devastated the economy.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken this very badly, likening it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
France’s Prime Minister Jean Castex has said that the nation “would not survive economically or socially” if a national curfew were to be imposed.
Many advisers hope that the local resource that will reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities or regions will be enough to hold back the virus in the next round if it comes.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three in Iceland
Three domestic transmissions were detected yesterday, plus two in addition to the border.
Five people were diagnosed with positive Covid-19 infection in Iceland.
In a statement, one of the infections is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to solitary confinement and sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of a sports club in Reykjavík and is, according to the report, "only part of the sports team" in quarantine.
Others who were sent in quarantine relate to the man in a different way.
The source of this infection is unknown and transmission is in full swing by the transmission team of the Director of State Police.
The organizers of the ReyCUP have complied with the guidelines and regulations of the National Health and Public Health Service that are still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
However, pictures of the tournament yesterday drew attention, where it was possible to see in very close association to celebrate the good performance of their team on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the presenters posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
ATH: Parents, please respect the rules that competitors pick up their own stuff at school.
Parents are not allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding.”
Another infection was detected yesterday but is related to the infection reported the previous day.
“Icelandic genetic analysis has identified the infection and a new type of virus has been identified that has not been detected here before.”
Infectious disease is also being treated and the person is infected in solitary confinement and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was found on the southwestern corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already beginning to show signs of viral transmission.
In addition, two people were identified at the border and are awaiting the results of further research, such as a work history in cross-border infections.
Finally, the announcement states: The Civil Protection Department of the Director of State Police and the Directorate of Health urge people to be careful and pay close attention to individual infection prevention.
If there is the least doubt about the presence of the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus, the same person is asked to have a sampling at the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur says the campsite is booked up for a shopping weekend - Directs guests other
The camp site at Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur is fully booked this weekend, according to the announcement from Vesturbygg<0xC3><0xB0>ur.
Guests are advised to look for other accommodations.
Names Vesturbyggd Bíldudalur, Tálknafjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, Melanes at Rau<0xC3><0xB0>asandur, Hótel Flókalund and Hótel Brei<0xC3><0xB0>avík as other options in the position.
Enough to be at Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur this weekend, because as in previous years, Skjaldborg, the festival of Icelandic documentaries, will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and therefore has become a strong tradition in the city.
From an application to the camp site, a good attendance can be expected this year, if the weather does not put a bar in the account, but DV said earlier today from a disastrous prediction.
However, we can expect the worst weather in the south, and hope for the Patriksfir<0xC3><0xB0>ir.
The website bb.is first reported, and said that all the other lodgings in the city were already fully booked.
An entire apartment building caves down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live for free at Dunhaga 18-20.
In the meantime, the owners are seeking a building permit for renovation, but their business has been growing in the system for the third year.
One of Reykjavík’s oldest, greenest and most expensive districts is home to a magnificent apartment building on three floors.
On the ground floor of the building is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
Behind the house there are two stairway doors, each of which holds four fairly spacious apartments.
They are in the range of 93–130 square meters, though most are over 100.
The house has a lot of history.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted video rentals, Skóstofan, Mjölkurssamsalinn’s milk shop, Jóa Gunsmith, fish sales and most recently University prints.
The house, to put it mildly, remembers its foolish beauty.
The house is now under severe damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are, according to the company register, Magnús Magnússon and Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús went for the ownership group of Borgin and was a defender of the holding company Borgin.
In the group of owners of the holding company Borginur is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún’s investment company Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún is also the owner of a third of D18 ehf.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún and her husband, <0xC3><0x81>gúst Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>sson, once ran the Steel Ship.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little or nothing been maintained since then.
Neighbors say that the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since, but mostly in recent years.
On a Facebook page in the neighborhood, one resident said the house had “not been very lively in the last few years.”
This may be due to the fact that for several years the owners have sought to change the house and plot of land.
Other neighbors say the house hasn't been okay for a long time.
“It’s time to do something nice about this spot and it’s sad that it’s been pulled that way.”
He also says that he is angry with the owners of the house for not being able to finish this, finding some common ground with the neighbors of the house and stopping this “legal staple”.
“Just do it in consultation with the community around so you can hurry up and finish it.”
The “legal tap” to which it refers is the planning process of the field that has been in progress since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were searched for permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the building, a new elevator building and an extension on one floor as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that construction was appealed to the Environmental and Resources Appeals Committee and the Committee annulled it because the construction did not support the divisional structure and the environmental promotion was insufficient.
The City of Reykjavík then embarked on a divisional work and concluded it with an advertisement in the Official Gazette in July last year.
It was also approved and cancelled by the committee in March 2020.
At this point, almost three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house at the start.
At that time, the house had fallen down considerably and the neighbors began to get tired.
When you asked the neighbors about the situation and the reaction of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the owners of the house, others did not.
Others were angry at the city, others weren’t.
Others were angry, but no one was angry.
Still others said the parking lot was a hassle, but neighbors have a new unused Dunhaga 18–20 parking lot under their vehicles.
One complainant in the case said that he was tired of the administration:
“The fact that we have to go through the process three times is unbelievable.
It’s like the city of Reykjavík couldn’t read.”
Today the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial to the swift phase of the city’s administration and the noble intentions of the owner and their many years of work now at the start.
When a reporter approached Dunhaga 18, he had a door open and a pile of rubbish.
Playstation computers and recent television lay among other garbage on the planet —victims of Icelandic summer bluetooth.
The door was opened into the old office of the University Printing Office, where a large number of cats of the smell of gleaming smelled.
It’s clear that someone has been sweeping around in one corner but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds, and several pallets of geology pages, which were no doubt to become a book, flickered.
The building’s staircases were also open and life in both of them.
A reporter was fortunate enough to meet one of the residents.
The Romanians were cooking potatoes for dinner and invited the journalist in.
The Romanians work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and simulate sources of DV that the company has paid nothing for the building except heat and electricity.
Due to the state of the house, it is not advisable to collect the rent.
From the postage in the lobby of the building it is clear that a lot of foreign workers have lived there in the last few months.
Employee leasing operations have not been affected by the Covid-19 situation, as a reduction in tourism led to a contraction in the construction sector and these two industries were the most efficient to take advantage of the services of employee leasing.
Nonetheless, householders at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do and hung the work gaps and wickers in the community to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist said goodbye to the Romanian boys, the sarcasm suddenly became clear: At the best location in Reykjavík, 1,500 square meters of real estate are demolished.
Owners want to change the house for improvement and neighbors want to improve the condition but disagree about the definition of "progress".
In between, the city’s planning department sits at the starting point, victim of endless appeals and appeals in the planning process and the phased resolution of the Judgment Committee on Environment and Resources.
In the house there are Romanian workers, perhaps just those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article originally appeared in the weekend paper DV July 17.
In the post-coronavirus epidemic anti-obesity campaign
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will provide <0xC2><0xA3>10 million to campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on fast food advertising, following his serious illness, partly due to his weight.
Johnson is expected to present the campaign, which has been called Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, which will encourage doctors to prescribe cycling for their overweight patients and will also engage in a campaign to increase cycling paths.
Television advertising will be banned before 9 p.m., according to the British media.
“COVID-19 has awakened us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is determined that we must use our time to become healthier, more active, and eat healthier foods,” a government spokesman said.
Johnson himself has had a weight problem, but he was hospitalized in intensive care when he contracted the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly because of his weight that he is thought to have become so seriously ill.
Women are more likely to lead the change.
She said that the new constitution would be the biggest step that the nation could take towards greater dispersion of power, transparency and the fight against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to change gear a little now and who is better suited to lead such a change than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
“They’re women,” Helga said.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s unity.
To stand together and be united in leading change.
Now it’s up to us to make these changes.”
She said she was a little concerned about the emphasis on Iceland as “the best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“We’re not ready to see what needs to be done.
As the Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
There's a lot.
We need to know where we’re coming from and listen to the story.
Listen to the voices of peripheral groups.
“We don’t all have the same rules,” Helga said.
When asked, she said women are in many ways good in Iceland, but added that, as in many other places, Icelanders live with extremely masculine values.
She said that politics revolved around self-interest, dominance and power that were the forces that sustained inequality in all societies.
“Women have now formed this group and come together and are just getting a little annoyed that Althingi is going to pull over this 2012 referendum,” she said.
“That’s the feminine value we’re thinking about.
On the basis of human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we are all really at the same table," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the basic values of the new constitution.
“We are a very rich country with natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty here.
It's ridiculous, we can change things differently," Helga said.
“It’s ridiculous that there is a natural law that women’s jobs are always lower paid.
It’s ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to endlessly stand in a struggle just to get a decent salary.”
The signature list for the new constitution can be signed here through electronic Iceland.
Tried to rob a pedestrian in the city centre
A man was arrested in the city centre last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in <0xC3><0x81>rb<0xC3><0xA6>r, where two people were arrested for the case.
Then the police stopped the driver of the motorcycle in the mountains where its driver was at a speed of 146 km with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn around last night and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise due to noise.
On Saturday night, reports of eleven noisy parties were received, which was widely regarded in the police diary.
Last night, however, there were 22 noises on board the police.
Six people were locked up in prison last night.
Police were called at night when firefighters fired fireworks.
They had escaped when police officers arrived.
Nine drivers were arrested for drunkenness and/or drug driving.
Four people were arrested for fighting in the city centre last night, one of whom was placed in a prison cell.
Then two were taken to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city center and the other in Vesturb<0xC3><0xA6>n.
One was taken to an accident unit after he was injured by jumping on a trampoline in Kopavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who dragged a caravan at Kjalarnesi yesterday.
According to the police diary, the motorcycle was in “very bad condition” and was stationary.
You can stay at Monet's house for the shopping weekend
The house that impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his practice in is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next few free nights in the house are about the shopping weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If you want to rent a house, you must rent it for at least two nights.
Based on Airbnb’s website, it’s next unlocked in a week, on a shopping weekend Sunday, so it might be ideal for some holiday shoppers to hurry up to book the painter’s house.
The two nights over the weekend cost only USD 964, or just over ISK 130,000 as Fréttabla<0xC3><0xB0>i<0xC3><0xB0> gets closer.
Dozens in quarantine, and several of them begin to show signs of the coronavirus disease
Five people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus in the last three days and most of them are unrelated.
Dozens have been quarantined because of this, and some of them are beginning to show signs of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronavirus in Norway yesterday and two at border screening.
According to a specialist in the Directorate of Health, a growing number of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading further into society.
“It’s been segregated from the first domestic infection and it’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, so we don’t have any particular reason to think it’s been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigrí<0xC3><0xB0>ur Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the Department of Disease Control at the Directorate of Health.
Most of the infected people have been related to individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling will take place in the near future, but some who were in contact with the infected have begun to show signs of the coronavirus.
“Now there is no influenza going on and less about other respiratory infections so we can be fairly liberal in doing these tests on individuals who during the influenza period would have found reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
Infecting is mostly complete, but it is not impossible that more people need to go into quarantine.
Two of the victims were diagnosed after attending a sporting event.
This raises questions as to whether it is appropriate to hold such an event.
The Civil Protection Officer says it well slowly as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
Kamilla says it is virtually impossible for the infected to be infected during the sports tournaments.
“If there are no more people in isolation from these individuals after having interacted with them at these sporting events, then we can claim that our prevention at the tournaments has worked.
"But it's not clear," said Kamilla.
The Department of Public Security is under constant review.
"We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems justified," Kamilla said.
Within a week, the number of people will be increased to 1,000.
This new position may have an impact on relaxation.
"Certain Thoughts to Cook" - See Elisa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>ars menu
Elísa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>arsdóttir is an accomplished woman in football and plays with Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the day and usually takes the time to cook good and nutritious food.
My usual day starts with coming to work at 8am,” says Elisa.
“After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I pick up my girl at the kindergarten at about three o’clock.”
Elisa finds it very satisfying to pick up her daughter early in kindergarten.
"It's good to have time with her before I go to practice later on.
It’s good to come home after work and just warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one show to clear our minds.”
Elisa does not follow any specific diet.
She is putting her final hand on a master thesis in nutrition and therefore knows what is suitable for her to eat to have enough energy to do her work, school, family and exercise.
“What suits me is to eat a variety of foods that are well-combined with proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not classify food into bad or good, rather nutritious or low-nutrition.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not all at once.”
Elisa is very interested in cooking.
“I think it’s a good idea to sit in the kitchen and cook a lot.
I have to say that my confidence is with me in the kitchen and I really believe that I’m a decent cook.”
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, let in almond milk overnight.
Finish this meal with whatever is available.
It’s usually bananas and mushrooms and coffee.
I'm a big coffee lady.
Dimensions: Incredibly different, but fruits or vegetables, flat cakes, clean skyr with bananas and mushrooms, bread with toppings and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of the box if that's the case.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of delicious salads from what’s in the fridge, kino or barley, falafel buns, rock salad, oven-baked vegetables with a good dressing is a bit what I’m working with.
If the plan goes completely out of control (which happens often) then the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled eggs, don’t put more on you.
Meal: Get me something carbohydrate-rich for exercise, bread with toppings, cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often the choice of my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflict between police and protesters in Seattle
The city of Seattle, Washington State, has declared a state of revolt following mass protests in the city centre.
Police yesterday fired fire and fire sprayed pepper to try to clear a large area conquered by the Protestants, stretching over many blocks of houses in the vicinity of the city’s parliament building.
Police reported on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was under way into a vandalism carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The city and police say that protesters stoned police with stones, bottles, shells and other loose items and one police officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were committed.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blow was for them to show the protesters in Portland, Oregon solidarity, where there has been repeatedly a fierce clash between protesters and heavily armed federal police.
There, like in many cities in the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, remembering George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding rectification.
Do not withdraw until after the vote
It is not yet clear whether the cancellations of Icelandair’s flight attendants, which will take effect at the next month’s conference, will be revoked.
The electronic vote on Icelandair's collective agreement on behalf of Icelandair's hostess will end tomorrow at noon.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, the chairman of the company, says he is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the resignations until the outcome of the vote is known.
“It’s very close,” says Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug Liney.
“There have been no cancellations, these must be made available so that the machines can be manned.
And of course, people are anxious to know if there will be work after the end of the month.”
The agreement was signed a week ago, on July 19.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement previously voted by flight attendants.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the Board of Trustees of Icelandair agreed to announce a general cessation of work at Icelandair, and members voted to do so.
She never came, but this was decided following Icelandair’s decision to discontinue talks with the airline, dismiss all its flight attendants and seek agreements with another union.
The pilots of the company were then required to take on the duties of safety personnel on board temporarily.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug Liney says it’s hard to say.
“People are hurt after this visit by Icelandair, when all the flight attendants of the company were dismissed and announced that they would negotiate with another union.
“I’ll see if it has an effect,” she said.
940 flight attendants worked at Icelandair at the end of April, and 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
The deadline for resignation is different, for those with the shortest working life it is three months and therefore ends at the beginning of July-August.
About 90% of Icelandair’s flight attendants are Icelandair’s flight attendants.
What happens if the agreement is not approved?
“We are looking forward to continuing our conversations with our partners.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants have gone too far."
Voting on collective bargaining closes and Icelandair announces its second quarter results tomorrow
The flight attendant's vote on a new collective bargaining agreement ends at noon tomorrow.
Icelandair’s results for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results indicate that the company’s earnings have fallen by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic vote on Icelandair’s collective agreement with Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at 12 noon.
Those eligible to vote for the contract are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the airline.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new collective bargaining agreement on the night of Sunday 19 July, but Icelandair had discontinued talks with the company on Friday after flight attendants put the previous agreement to a vote in early July.
Icelandair had announced all flight attendants and flight crews on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to a new collective agreement, flight attendants are required to fly five more hours a month for the same basic salary.
The collective bargaining agreement is valid until 2025, which has integrated provisions for pilots and flight attendants on how long they can fly on a single shift.
The agreement was presented to members of FFI at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and expressed dissatisfaction with many flight attendants to whom the news agency spoke about the agreement.
However, most of them seemed to agree that it would be necessary to accept the agreement in order to keep the FFI alive.
Icelandair’s second quarter results will be announced tomorrow, but EBIT, the company’s operating profit for financial items and taxes, is negative according to preliminary operating results of USD 100 to 110 million or ISK 15 billion.
Icelandair sent preliminary calculations to the Stock Exchange last Wednesday, stating that the company’s revenues amounted to about $60 million in the quarter, or about ISK 8.3 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents were about $154 million by the end of the quarter, around $21 billion.
Icelandair is also planning to offer out its share capital in August.
Icelandair aims to conclude agreements with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before the share auction.
A new strain rather than a new type of virus
“A new virus just means that it has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been happening here in Iceland," says Már Kristjánsson, head of the infectious disease department at Landspítali, about reports that a "new type of virus" has been detected in Iceland.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in the social work of a sports club at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the origin of the infection is unidentified and infection is ongoing.
An infection was also diagnosed in a person who arrived on 15 July and two who were in contact with him began to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday, an infection related to an infection reported the previous day was detected, and after sequencing by Icelandic genetic analysis, a “new type of virus that has not been detected here before” was found.
The infectious disease is complete in connection with this infection.
It is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread around the world, the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is better to talk about a new type of virus than a new type of virus.
Asked what it means and if it could say something about the second wave of the epidemic has started, Már says that as it is a single case and it could happen that there will be nothing more out of it.
“If, on the other hand, there are cases in Iceland that do not have connections from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then that conclusion [of the second wave] could be drawn, but it is premature at this time,” explains Már.
Happiness in the Hot Pot
Is the secret to the happiness of Icelanders hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC’s programmers lead the way in a fun video that sheds light on the country’s swimming pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bathing culture is unique globally and it is claimed that nowhere in the world there are as many bathing places per person.
The natural geothermal energy is its basis, but also the tradition of swimming that prevails here.
Children’s swimming lessons were compulsory in 1940, but older citizens are not less diligent to use the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming trips are described as a permanent part of the country’s general welfare.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and position.
With mobile phones available, people talk together on personal note about home and space or enjoy the healing power of water: meditate and recharge the batteries of soul and body.
I'm going to spend a hundred days in elections.
There are 100 days until the U.S. elects a president for a four-year term.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-election, but he is on the verge of re-election.
Joe Biden, a Democratic candidate, has a huge national advantage over Trump, according to polls.
According to a recent AP survey, a record number of Americans believe that the nation is on the wrong path.
Trump’s response to the new coronavirus pandemic is also very unpopular, and more Americans than ever before believe that the president has held the economy badly.
Only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
Thirty-two percent say they support Trump’s response to the epidemic, and 48 percent say he’s kept the economy healthy.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 percent nationally, while Trump is 41.9 percent nationally.
Trump himself has tried to shift attention away from his performance in the epidemic of Biden, pushing for so-called cultural controversies and advocating policies that are supposed to turn to law and order.
Biden’s bid is hard-pressed to keep Trump’s attention, and considers it likely to win if the election is really about Trump’s performance over the past four years.
Trump’s disapproval also seems to be going down on Republican MPs, fearing that Democrats might even get a majority in the U.S. Senate, which so far has been seen as very shabby.
Politico said in the days that it would remain a follower of parties and candidates comparable to what it is now, the Republican Party would receive its greatest demolition in decades.
In the 2016 parliamentary elections, Utfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur has proved particularly bad for the party, and now there is a prospect that this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to intimidate suburban residents to follow him, including by saying that if President Biden becomes President, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and foment racial discord.
Trump has repealed a White House regulation designed to diversify suburban communities.
He then urged the “housewives” of suburban Americans to read an article by former New York deputy governor, who claimed Biden would destroy the suburbs of the United States and accepted Trump.
“Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!” he said.
The population of the U.S. suburbs is an ever-growing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since the re-election of George W. Bush in 2004, the candidate with the majority of the vote has been elected president.
In 2012, Mitt Romney won the majority of the vote but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that despite Trump’s secured a narrow majority in the suburbs in 2016, his followers there have significantly contracted.
Although there are differences between the polls, Biden has recommended a fifteen percent advantage over Trump in outsourcing lately.

Will the Olympic fire be the light at the end of the tunnels?
After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, events that only world wars have hitherto haunted, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic fires of fame would be “the light at the end of the tunnels,” probably pointing there to the pandemic of coronavirus that the world is now traversing.
Democracies have years to prepare, and Japan’s government is paying for the delay.
They all end up with a lot of heads.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for the Olympics this year, the celebrations of the Japanese representatives were genuine.
They cried and laughed in turn, as Tokyo had applied to hold the 2016 Games, but this time bowed down to Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo City and Japan were to bathe in the world’s attention.
The games were scheduled to take place on July 24 to August 9, but have been postponed for a year, starting instead on July 23, 2021, and ending on August 8.
If the games fail to be held, if the coronavirus becomes still too much of a threat, the games will be cancelled.
No one wants to think that way to the end.
Olympics are not an ordinary sport.
Nothing is spared, the show should always be fabulous and strive to top the last game.
The selection of a city for the Olympics is based on the evaluation of the selection committee on the presentations of the cities.
The greater the presentation —the greater the likelihood of receiving the hustle.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to host the 2016 Olympics, or $20 billion.
For the second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, $75 million, about $10 billion, was put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would win the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent 30 billion kroner on the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and generally to strengthen the country’s infrastructure to manage such tournaments, prepare it and hold the games themselves.
Japan said the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been held these days but has been postponed by a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report from the Auditor General of Japan published at the end of last year showed that the cost was almost double that number.
The cost of postponing the games will probably not be fully estimated, but it has been estimated that it could cost between $2 billion and $6 billion in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore range from $15 billion to $30 billion.
The figures are so high that all the Icelandic state’s tax revenues only survived about half the Olympic Games, at the lowest possible cost.
Olympic Games are events of such magnitude that they have often become the topic of discussion by economists, who try to look at the numbers and look at the benefits and gains of the games.
In short, it seems that quite a lot of people have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympics is less than positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
There are some short-term effects, for example a very large number of jobs in the short term, but in the long term cities tend to suffer from debt constraints and high operating costs for low-used structures.
Rio, Brazil, is facing significant debt due to the 2016 Games and has been experiencing difficulties in costing maintenance on all the large sports facilities built for the Games.
The 2012 London Olympic Games have revealed that only 10 percent of people who got jobs at the Olympics in London were previously unemployed.
This means that we were not talking about new jobs except for a small amount.
In general, cities have not fared very well in terms of keeping the Olympics financially due to the striking costs associated with the structures built for the Games.
However, the benefits are often thought to be due to the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the games, although there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the 2021 Games.
It is also unclear whether all the audiences will be able to attend the games.
The most important thing, however, is the honor that the cities get to be elected, but it is difficult to estimate for money.
In spite of the huge cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not such that it can be put on a price tag.
But even though the show is a big one and nowhere to be spared, of course it’s not just about money.
It is the heroes who are at the forefront.
For some fans, it’s just a surprise to postpone the game.
The Australian quintet lady and gold medalist Chloe Esposito, for example, is a soloist and would have been far from a lot of fun this summer, but hopes to be in the form of a competition for the 2021 Games.
She is one of those people who is quite happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who intended to quit after the games this year, if they had been held on time, the postponement of the games in some cases means that they quit the competition before the games take place.
Trust their bodies simply not to go through years in addition to rigorous workouts.
Few athletes were as well placed in the hearts of the spectators at the Olympics in Rio 2016 and the gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has appeared in several interviews in his home country of the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She’s planning to play in 2021, but she’s not sure if she’ll still be at the top of the games next year, as she’ll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a leading gymnast.
"It's a sensitive issue," Biles said, smiling at another in an interview published on Instagram, asking if she intends to go as far as the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
“I just don’t know if I’ll still be at the top after a whole year of training,” Biles said.
She has previously said that her body does not tolerate the stress of gymnastics training much longer.
However, she is still practicing for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop exercising suddenly when the pandemic was at its height and the gymnasium was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles as well as others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form is certainly a little bit better than most people.
“We have a big plan now.
It was hard to start practicing again after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we’re back to full speed and I’m going to increase my training steadily over the course of the year.
Of course, we don’t know exactly how these games will be or if they will be held, but we still practice considering that they will be, can’t do otherwise.
I’ve put too much effort into leaving the sport now,” Biles says.
With her, as with others, there is a slumber of doubt or perhaps more awareness that the situation may arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.
Predicting it is hopeless.
No one can know what the status of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympic Games given that they will be held this year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid canals.
Delayed wedding due to epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was to marry former Bachelorette rival Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now," she told People.
“We’d love to get married sometime and have the wedding of our dreams and have all the people who are dear to us.
But we decided to put it on hold and focus on what’s important right now and it’s helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look more at the world than weddings these days.
There is a lot going on and we need to focus on what is happening in the world.”
