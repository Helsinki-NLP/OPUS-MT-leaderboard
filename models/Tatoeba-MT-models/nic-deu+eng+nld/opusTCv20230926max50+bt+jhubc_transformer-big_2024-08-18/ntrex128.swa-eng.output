Wales Council delegates worry about 'looking like puppets'
There are concerns among some delegates after the proposal to be their position should be changed to MWP (the Welsh Parliamentary Commissioner).
This is due to the plan to change the name of the council to the Parliament of Wales.
Council delegates from all political circles are concerned that the move will cause sarcasticism.
A Leba delegate said his group was concerned that the name " corresponded to Twp and Pwp."
For readers abroad in Wales: In Detective twp means idiot and pwp means feces.
Plaid's referendum messenger said that the group in general was "not pleased" and has proposed an alternative name.
The conservative conservative delegate said his group was "thinking in ideas" about the name change, but said it was the abbreviations of the MWP to the Pig.
In this context, the letter w is pronounced the same as the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Council commission, which is currently enacting legislation to introduce a name change, said: "The final decision on any basic word about how the Council delegation is actually referred to will be of the delegates themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 201<0x37> paid the Welsh council the authority to change its name.
In June, Jopo published the results of public consultations on proposals that were broadly supported by referring to the council as the Welsh Parliament.
In regards to the rank of Council Messengers, Jopo favored the Legislative Commissioners of Wales or WMP, but the MWP option received further support in consultation with the public.
As seen, Councillors recommend an alternative option, but efforts to reach an agreement may be a challenge to Superintendent Officer, Elin Jones, orbye are expected to submit a legislative draft on changes within a few weeks.
Act on amendments will include other changes to how the council works, including laws to eliminate the merit of the Commissioner of the Council and the structure of the board system.
Council delegates will vote the final vote on the name they will be called when they are discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide if they change the name of the country to "North Macedonia."
This popular vote was planned to resolve a conflict that has existed for a decade with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
The authorities in Athens maintain that the name of neighboring countries in the north represents a claim to their territory and has continued to oppose its request to become a member of the European Union and the NATO Union.
Macedonian president Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the direct referendum on changing the name, has said he will ignore the referendum.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that a change of name is needed so they can join the European Union and the NATO Alliance.
St. Martin's bells Go Silence as Churches in Harlem Pass through Chagamoto
"Historically, the elders I have circled with say that there was a church and a bar in every angle," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, none."
He said the absence of a bar is understandable.
"People march differently" nowadays, he said.
"They are reluctant to be like a neighbor's living room where people meet from time to time."
As a part of churches, he is concerned that the money available from selling assets will not last a project that leaders expect as well, "and soon they will return to their preliminary situation."
Churches, he added, may be converted into a large, private-owned apartment that will not help maintain the remaining reserves in the surrounding area.
"The vast majority of people who buy private houses in these whips will be white," he said, "and thus this situation will facilitate the closure of these churches as a whole because there is no possibility that people in these apartments will be allies of these churches."
Both churches were built by white allies before Harlem became a city of black <0xE2><0x80><0x93> City Community in 1<0x38><0x37>0 and named St. Martin a decade later.
White-white Native Methidists left the 1930s.
Members who were black who were participating in the surrounding area took the poles.
St. Martin became under black allies under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a strike of retailers at 125th Street, the main street for purchase in Harlem, who refused to hire or cooperate with blacks.
The 1939 fire left the building badly damaged, but when members in the Church of Priest Johnson set plans to reconstruct it, they authorized the establishment of a set of bells played using keyboards or an orthodox technique.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Priest Johnson and heir of St. Martin, called a set of bells "the bells of the poor."
A professional who played a set of bells in July named it another name: "a cultural fund" and a "unchanged historical issue."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also recognized that it was the world's first set of bells that was played by the black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the area of the largest set in Riverside Church 1<0x38> years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not seek another replacement.
The bells that have been played in St. Martin for the past several months have been played by architects and contractors in a way torque, some of whom were brought by the clergy, and others brought by the Bishops' diocese.
The administrative council in the parish, which includes administrators - wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "had planned to move costs" to the council, even though the council had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors who were sent by the diocese.
Some of the allies complained of absence and transparency from the diocese.
Pope injures a 13-year-old child while diving to trap a rope-tree in California
The Pope attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving to trap a rope-tree in Carlifonia on the first day of the rope-tree season, officials said.
The invasion occurred shortly before 1 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a young man screaming calling for help and then they rowed with a group to help him put in the water.
Hammel said that the first time he thought he thought it was just a thrill to trap a rope-tree, but "I found out that he was screaming, 'I've been killed!
I've been bored!"
His shoulder bone had come out," Hammel said he discovered it soon after he reached the boy.
"I cried to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a sharks in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed in critical condition.
The species of the shark who made an invasion is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a session with journalists that the shark had been seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was noted that it was not a species of dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries in the top of his two.
Officials closed offshore access from Pontus Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 4<0x38> hours for investigations and security reasons.
Giles suggested there are over 135 species of shark in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury wants to fight Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using aesthetic rows with staff who are assistant specialists.
If much of the planning into the beauty market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.<0x38> billion in the UK, which continues to grow with sales of fashion and home appliances decrease, large aesthetic ranges will be tested in 11 stores across the country and established in more stores next year if this move is successful.
Investment in beauty has come true as supermarkets are looking for techniques to fill elevator spaces that were in use to keep television, microwave and home appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the release of beauty products to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing editions from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more spaces with posted locations similar to those in stores such as Boots.
This supermarket also relaunches a store of various cosmetic products so that most of the products are suitable for non-meaters <0xE2><0x80><0x93> which is heavily pressured by young consumers.
Moreover, the retailer Fragrance Shop will perform tests at two Sainsbury stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and consumer privileges of daily food products to a small extent in a nearby retail store means supermarkets have to make more effort to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the leading executive in Sainsbury, has said that the store will have more appearances like the stores with a supermarket attempting to deal with Aldi and Lidl by providing more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has been introducing small Argos stores in hundreds of shops and has also established some Habitats stores beginning when it purchased the two lines two years ago, which says that it has increased the sales of vegetables and made the customer access service more useful.
The original attempt at the supermarket to resurrect its beauty units and drugs was invariably attacked.
Sainsbury experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger broke after a dispute emerged about how to share revenues from pharmaceutical stores in its supermarkets.
A new strategy was introduced after Sainsbury sold its 2<0x38>1-dollar pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmaceuticals, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds is said to have contributed to the deal, by adding more brands of facial and leather care products including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's business, said: "We have changed the appearance and nature of our aesthetic ranges to improve our customers' environment.
We have also invested in professional staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our various editions have been designed to meet all the needs and environments that are attractive and the right place means that we have now become an exciting place for beauty products where they offer great competition for the early ways of making purchases."
Peter Jones 'disappointed' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
The Star of the Dragons Den, Peter Jones was left to be 'destroyed' after television presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million-million-dollar business with his live brand business to focus more on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have enough time for their Truly brand of domestic and spare products.
The trade of the two was connected to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning broadcaster, aged 3<0x37>, wrote on Instagram to announce that he is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons star" Den Peter Jones outraged by withdrawing from their impressive branding of live fashion <0xE2><0x80><0x93> to take into account his new franchise contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
News sources say that Jones "was mad" when the famous TV girl admitted at a meeting that was nervous on Tuesday at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new home business plans - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant they wouldn't afford time
The business had been compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow and had been said to increase Willoughby's double fortune estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 3<0x37>, wrote on Instagram to announce that he was leaving the Truly business, Jones left England on a flight to one of his vacation homes.
The source said: "Truly was among the things Holly took into consideration.
It was his permanent future that would allow him to continue for more than decades to come.
His decision to withdraw was a surprise to everyone involved.
No one believed something was going on Tuesday, the launch time was too close.
There are warehouses filled with commodities at Marlow Headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning show announcer, who is all the most reliable in the UK, could cost the business millions of dollars due to large investments in goods including rivers, candles, clothes and home appliances and possible delays for launch.
And it can mark the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her cousin Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 201<0x36> and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple go on vacation with Jones who owns 40<0x25> at Baldwin's Runinga Production Factory.
Willoughby is expected to be the M<0x26>S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's A Celebrity.
A news source near Jones said last night that "We couldn't comment on his controversial activities."
A stupendous conversation 'and then we fell in love with each other'
He joked about criticism that he would get from news organizations by commenting that others would consider to be "inappropriate to the president" and in praising the leader of North Korea.
Why is President Trump more disappointed?
Trump said in his sarcastic voice "a news broadcaster".
"I have not given up on anything."
He suggested that Kim prefers a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step in removing nuclear weapons from North Korea.
But the negotiations for the removal of nuclear weapons have been stalled.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the U.N. The United Nations General Assembly Saturday that the nation of North Korea has not seen a "equal measure" from the United States for the early steps to disarm North Korea.
Instead, he said, Marekena has promoted sanctions that aim to increase pressure.
Trump had a promising attitude in his speech at a public meeting.
"We're going well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we've set up a good partnership."
He said his efforts to improve cooperation with Kim have brought good results <0xE2><0x80><0x93> halting rocket tests, assisting in the release of hostages and assisting in the homecoming of American troops' corpses.
And he defended his odd way of discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this full field, we'd have 200 people standing there," Trump said, stretching the finger to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and the Indonesian Earthquake Brings Holocaust to the Island, Killing Hundreds of People
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told it was unnecessary.
Even though more than 10<0x25> of Lombok's people had been evacuated, no national disaster was declared, a condition necessary to stimulate international assistance.
"In most cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they do not apply for international assistance, and that is challenging". Mrs. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children blocked the team together to travel to Palu, it is not certain if foreign workers can work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Due to occasional ground vibrations that occur in Indonesia, hio has survived in a state of inefficiency due to natural disasters.
Although residential sheds due to the tsunami effect have been built in Aceh, they are less common in coastal areas.
The actual lack of tsunami warning bells in Palu, even though warning existed, may have contributed to disaster.
In better conditions, travelling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make transport operations complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for treatment of victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo used the infrastructure that deployed Indonesia as the core of your electoral campaign, and has spent a lot of money on road and rail construction.
But financial deficit has become a challenge for Mr. Joko's government as he approaches election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from serial groups, where many Muslim allies have had conservative beliefs.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of evacuations were evacuated as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, by striking swords, bows and arrows and other severe weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge hits a sharp balancing draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the Premier League match against Chelsea by closing in the <0x38>9th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards from Chelsea's gate while his team was behind with a 1<0xE2><0x80><0x93>0 score.
He moved the ball with a left leg before lifting a pass to the top edge of the gate.
The plaque jumped over the defensive area and toward the upper right corner of the net.
The ball then passed over the flying Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended in the net.
"It was just trying to be in a hijack position, to reach the ball with players like Shaq all the time playing the ball forward as far as they can, so I tried to commit myself as long as I can," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come in and I took one touch and I didn't even think much about it and just hit the shorts."
Chelsea led 1<0xE2><0x80><0x93>0 during the break after closing the goal 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues team's attacker hit a heel without returning it to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before rotating in the center of the field and running on the Liverpool gate side.
Kovacic handed a pass to another player and surrounded the opponent and received it in the middle of the field.
He then struck a barrel that allowed Hazard to head into the box.
Hazard climbed the defenders and tied their pace on the other side's side axis with a left leg shot against Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool are matched by Napoli in group matches for the Champions League at 9pm on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are matched by Videoton in the Europa League at 9pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to <0x38>32
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to <0x38>32, the country's disaster agency said earlier on Sunday.
Many people were reported trapped in debris of buildings damaged by a <0x37>.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday causing waves up to 20 feet, an organisation spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a meeting with reporters.
The town of Palu, which has over 3<0x38>0,000 people, was filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man, aged 32, for alleged murder after a woman was stabbed and died
A murder investigation has been initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning to wake up today.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 1.55 a.m. with a knife wound at Grayson Mews in John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested for alleged murder.
Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything appearing.
Investigator Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages but I would appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead and see or hear anything he doubted to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, specifically taxi drivers, who may have caught nothing with their car cameras to contact us because they may have explanations that are important to the investigation.'
A police spokesperson has confirmed that a woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was inside the building.
This afternoon friends who believe they know a woman have arrived in the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have said that they are in the process of informing business family members.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has now tried to enter his apartment but is told by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He didn't have to say when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told that it can take several hours before being allowed to enter the building.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman showed up in the area crying.
He continues to repeat the words 'very offensive'.
At <0x38> p.m. police cars were inside the building and another car out.
A number of officers stood in the apartment and tracked shingles.
Anyone with the information is asked to send a personal message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers team without identifying themselves via 0<0x38>00 555 111 and referring to the 24<0x37>th anniversary of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes a recent retrospective to the crisis of 're-writing history'
His removal will be a decentralized justice for his destruction similar to the Taliban with the many religious and cultural art of England enforced by his radical Puritan allies.
But the Community of Cromwell described Mr. Crick's proposal as "subjective" and "would not answer re-recording history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Community, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate about the elimination of the statue as an image of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Castle would be targeted.
The act of destroying symbols in civil wars in England was neither commissioned nor enforced by Cromwell.
Perhaps the worst that Cromwell would have been blamed on is the actions of Thomas' grandfather in the past century.
The striking representation of Mr. William Hamo Thorneycroft to Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a man who most believe it is still worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is respected by many, perhaps more in the 19th century than now, as an advocate of parliament due to external pressure, a situation in which it was the source of imperial leadership.
Whether this is all an accurate representation in the topic of the ongoing historical debate.
What is evident is that the war in the mid-1<0x37>th century has laid the foundation for the future development of our country and Cromwell is an individual recognized to represent one wing in the opposing groups.
His success as Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and celebration."
Pig Killer Amng'ata and Killing Chinese Farmer
A farmer was invaded and killed by pigs in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified by the last name of "Yuan," was found dead with a badly affected vein feeding blood near a pork hut on the market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give them a pig vaccine in a pork room on May 20, 2005 in <0x58>ining Province, <0x51>inghai, China.
He is said to have traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered the door of a neighboring pig shed was open.
He said that at a pig hut there was a male pig who had blood in his mouth.
Investigations confirmed that the <0xC2><0xA3>550-pound pig had ripped off and killed the farmer, according to reports.
"My cousin's feet were bloody and broken," a cousin, referred to by his first name as "Wu," said, how he was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Videos from security cameras showed Yuan arriving at the market at 10.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
An animal who killed the man was not heard by Yuan nor his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent anyone from raiding, while police gathered evidence in the area.
Yuan's family and market mammals are reportedly discussing his death.
Although they do not occur many times, the conditions of pigs invading humans have been recorded earlier.
In 201<0x36>, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a <0xC2><0xA3><0x36>50-pound pig pushed a Calcium Farmer against his tractor until his mistress shocked him and fled.
After a farmer in Oregon was fed by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but tasting blood might be "a stimulus."
"They're just playing.
They smell, and they want to know ... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to respect them properly," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring about heavy rainfall throughout the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa continues to deteriorate as it passes over static waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flood rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States for the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa was a winds of <0x38>5 mph, Type 1 hurricane, at 11 a.m. Eastern Hours on Sunday, and was seen 3<0x38>5 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
At this time, the atmosphere pressure has begun to disperse over the Pacific Ocean and head east towards the West Coast of the United States.[citation needed] With Hurricane Rosa approaching the Baja California peninsula on Monday if a tropical storm begins to push tropical humidity to the north in the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday
Then, the tropical humidity that begins to interfere with the impending atmosphere pressure will cause heavy rains in the Southwest in the future.
In interior areas, rainfall 1 to 4 inches will cause sudden flooding, mud slope and possible landslides in the desert.
Most tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates up to 2 to 3 inches per hour in one location, specifically parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Planned as rainfall rates of 2 to 4 inches in southwestern parts, most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding can occur due to ongoing conditions due to tropical rainfall conditions.
It will be extremely dangerous to go out into the desert by foot due to the risk of tropical rainfall.
Much of the rain can cause canyons to be large rivers and thunderstorms will bring high winds and scattered dust.
The imminent atmosphere will bring heavy rainfall to some coastal areas of Southern California.
The total rainfall rates that exceed half an inch may occur, which may cause low mud slopes and slipping roads.
This will be the first rainfall on an area in the rainy season.
Some of the rising tropical rain showers will begin heading to the areas of Arizona later on Sunday and Monday morning, before further rainfall later Monday and Tuesday.
Most of the rainfall will spread on the Four Horn on Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October there may be a change in temperature throughout the United States while Arctic temperatures decrease, but areas in the tropics will remain at an average temperature.
Sometimes this causes sudden changes in temperature over a short distance.
There is a good example of sudden variation in temperatures throughout the United States on Sunday.
There are approximately 20 degrees Fahrenheit difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the imminent summer temperature will try to disperse and spread again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. regions are expected to warm up at the beginning of October and spread at <0x38>0 degrees from the Southern Plains to the Northwest.
Temperatures in New York City can reach <0x38>0 degrees on Tuesday, which will be approximately 10 degrees higher than average.
Our long-term weather forecasts show a greater likelihood of extreme temperatures in the eastern United States to half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's case
More than 20 million people watched extensive evidence on Thursday with Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh and a woman who accuses him of sexual abuse which is said to have occurred in the 19<0x38>0s, Christine Blasey Ford, in six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular sessions to illuminate the final stage of Friday's events: an agreement implemented by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to investigate for a week on charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is 100<0x25> sure that Kavanaugh caught secret places when he was drunk and tried to pick clothes at a pepper school festival.
Kavanaugh, giving emotional testimony, said that he is 100<0x25> sure that it did not happen.
There are likely to be over 20.4 million people as reported by Nielsen on Friday they watched.
The company was numbering an average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC stations.
Statistics were not immediately available from other networks that aired, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And the Nielsen organization usually challenges counting people who are looking at deaths.
In order to put this in the right viewpoint, hooks are an audience equivalent to a soccer game viewer or the Academy of Training Awards.
The Fox News Center, whose commentators have been strongly linked to Kavanaugh's selection, led all networks with an average of 5.<0x36>9 million viewers during a day-long trial, Nielsen said.
ABC station was second with 3.2<0x36> million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.<0x38>9 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Ham remained on top after the trial.
Flake was the main theme in the Friday hiatus case.
After this average Republican officer issued a report that he would be supporting Kavanaugh's appointment, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning when he was trying to climb a elevator to attend the Court Committee's case.
He stood down for several minutes while being reprimanded, a live-action incident at CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think she's telling the country the truth?
She was told, "you are strong when most women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the lift was closed, that he would have much to say in the committee case.
The broadcasting and cable networks were all directly reflecting hours later, while the Court Committee was voting to further Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a full vote.
But Flake said he could do so with the knowledge that the FBI could investigate allegations against the electorate in the next week, which few Democrats have been arguing.
Flake was partially convinced by a conversation with his friend, the Democrat Senator. Chris Coons.
After a discussion with the Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's elections were strong, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation through the FBI over allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May has denounced opponents for 'playing politics' in connection with Brexit.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May denounced opponents of her plan to withdraw from the European Union for "playing politics" and the future of the United Kingdom and to harass national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 201<0x38>.
In another interview near him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his attacks on his plan known as Chequers for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the European Union should gather each other's tribute is "subjective."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police have arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for the second level of murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the war.
Police found glasses from the scene of the attack and said they found Simpson's DNA on glasses, WAFB's associate CBS said.
After interviewing Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
His fault is set to be <0xC2><0xA3>350,000, the Attorney reported.
East Baton Rouge's death office issued an earlier report on Friday, saying the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head inside the neck.
The department congratulates the Louisiana State Police Commissioner, a police crime laboratory, Southern University police and local citizens for assisting in an investigation that led to the arrest of a suspect.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked regional law departments for "bads and justice enforcement."
Sims was 20 years old.
The player's <0x36>-foot attacker was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played for the LSU basketball team.
He averaged 5.<0x36> points and 2.<0x36> rebounds in hitting the ball in the game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "very affected" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"Some things like this are what makes a person worry at all," Wade said.
Volcano launches ashes over Mexico City
The ashes that are thrown from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the neighbouring areas of southern Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from volcanoes after operations increased inside the crater and recorded 1<0x38>3 times of gas and ash supply for over 24 hours.
This station was monitoring many roars and vibrations.
Photographs on social media showed thin ash covering the mirrors of cars in neighboring Mexican city areas such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geologists have discovered an increase in activity on the volcano that is found 45 miles (<0x37>20 km) south-east of the capital since a <0x37>.1 magnitude earthquake occurred in central Mexico in September 201<0x37>.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police fight Catalan mariners to withdraw before voting anniversary celebration
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after supporters protesters clashed with protest police while thousands joined opposition protesters to commemorate the first year of Katalunya's separatist vote.
A group of puppet puppets who support quarantined by police hit them with eggs and threw them in powder paint, resulting in black clouds of dust on the streets that would normally have many tourists.
A riot also occurred later that day with police using their staff to face clashes.
For over several hours the pro-communist groups saying "No forget, no forgiveness" faced unified protesters who said, "Uspiania always."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries found in protests, regional media reported.
Concerns remain high in the area preferring independence a year after a October 1 referendum considered illegal by authorities in Madrid but celebrated by the Catalunya supporters of secession.
Voters largely chose to gain independence, although the number of people who emerged as low as anti-discrimination ignores the majority of votes.
According to the Catalunya authorities around 1000 people were injured last year after police attempted to suspend voting at polling stations throughout the region and caused a violent riot.
Support groups had camped all night on Friday to prevent protests to assist national police.
The protests continued but had to take a different approach.
Narcis Termes, <0x36><0x38>, an electrician who attended a quarantine protest and his wife said he was no longer optimistic of Katalunya's expectations for independence.
"The last year we got to live in the best moment of life.
I looked at my parents crying happily for being able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having a significant victory despite the last regional elections in December, Katakunya supporters have failed to maintain pace this year with many more known leaders being in exile by wishing or in detention waiting for a trial for providing a referendum and a future report for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car technician recording a protest that supported police on his phone, said that a dispute had been caused by politicians from both circles.
"The anxiety continues to rise further," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalunya leaders in a pre-trial jail since late last year, announced that he would seat in the European Parliament election next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European Parliament election is the best way to refuse to be brought back to democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was serialized for houses in Londonderry.
The event took place at Ballyngard Crescent on Thursday at <0x37>:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemings said damage was caused by the gates and the building itself.
The bow bow may also have been fired by a car at some point.
Menga lapa Livingston win 1<0xE2><0x80><0x93>0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston's promotion surprised the Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 1<0x38> matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal difference was the result between both teams while Gary Holt's team moved up and held second place equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains victorious in outdoor matches in the Premier League this season and will face the Hearts leaders, who are ahead of them by eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers will be native to the Vienna Rapids in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston have added the number of matches that have not failed to be six in the bridge, where head coach Holt has yet to lose since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses against non-league visitors
The Holt team had to be ahead long before closing, with their game of straight attack causing the Rangers to suffer all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson was able to get a chance but missed a target with his scratch passed in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only hit the ball out after infiltration to face the head ball from Craig Halkett.
The natives did not look nervous and allowed the Rangers to own the game, knowing that they could trouble visitors using the tapes.
And that's in that way where they managed to tie the goal.
The Rangers were penalised for a catcher and Livingston struggled to find a gap, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up and gave Menga a chance, who touched and tied theirs from the center of the box.
At the time, the Rangers had controlled the possession of the ball but failed to penetrate the home team's defensive back and gatekeeper Liam Kelly would not be stressed for a long period of play,
The format continued in the second period, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save his snap.
Scott Pittman was blocked from closing the batsmen by the Rangers' guard Allan McGregor and Lithgow landed the ball out after another Livingston catch game.
The attacks continued to catch the Livingston team box and continued to be removed, while two penalti demands — after Halkett dropped reserve player Glenn Middleton, and the other in relation to holding the ball in hand — were ignored.
'The Wonderful' from Livingston - an analysis
Alasdair Lamont at BBC Scots portal Tony Macaroni
Wonderful work and good results for Livingston.
In reality, they had a better game and continue to exceed expectations and by continuing to climb up to the table.
Their playing style with the team hasn't changed much since the return to the major leagues, but many compliments go to Holt in a way that he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett contributed a great deal, well possession of the well-organized defensive fortification, while Menga always gave the deal to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the entire match.
The Rangers missed, however.
Just as they've been good sometimes under Gerrard, they were under such standards.
They missed the final touch at the gate <0xE2><0x80><0x93> only once they were able to create a chance to get them in the home team's stronghold <0xE2><0x80><0x93> and the pitfall is a challenge for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets a different reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met with breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany <0xE2><0x80><0x93> which aims to modify relations between the two NATO allies.
They have varied in issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkish access to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
The town is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited safety reasons as a barrier to a crowd of 25,000 not to gather in front of the mosque, but many followers appeared in nearby areas to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - most of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The two-minute march marks a division about the president's viewpoint who appears as a hero to some German Turks and is stunned by others as a dictator.

Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Sudden Floods (Eastern Areas Can Benefit)
It is not uncommon for a tropical depression occurring in Arizona, but that is exactly what can happen early next week when the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the West Desert and cause sudden flooding risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued a sudden flood warning of Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday and approach later Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has described on the twitter that "10 tropical cyclones have maintained a storm and a reduction in pressure within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (19<0x36><0x37>) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
Recent examples of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches rainfall, as well as a few levels to <0x36> inches on Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Western Desert including the Great Basin Rockies are likely to get 1 to 2 inches and are likely to have a few levels of up to 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rosa may be a blessing because the area is drought.
Despite the flooding, some of these rainfalls may be beneficial because the South West region experiences dry conditions.
According to U.S. drought Tracking. just over 40<0x25> of Arizona experiences at least severe drought, the second-highest form," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's route leads to the ground via the Baja California Mexican peninsula.
Rosa, still with hurricane power on Sunday morning and the highest peak of <0x38>5 miles per hour, is found 3<0x38>5 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and heads north for 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing static water in the Pacific and thus its strength is declining.
Thus, it is expected to reach the ground in Mexico with the strength of tropical storms during the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rain in some parts of Mexico can be large and cause a high flooding risk.
"A rainfall of 3 to <0x36> inches is expected from Baja California to Sonora in the northwest and likely to reach up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the morning on Tuesday as a tropical depression and then heading up through Arizona and southern Utah Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected by Hurricane Rosa or its remains is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the Northwest Desert in Sonora and the United States. Desert Southwest," National Hurricane Center said.
Rainfall is expected to cause sudden flooding of life-threatening and mudfall in deserts and landslides in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Arrest of four attempted murder
Three young men of a 20-year-old man have been arrested on charges of murder attempt after a 1<0x36>-year-old boy was found to have been stabbed in Somerset.

Trump says Kavanaugh 'shown, fatigue and anger' of Democrats
"The vote of Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the brutal and horrific methods of the Democrat Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been "explained with fatigue and anger" of the Democrat Party during his entire selection process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally rejecting allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually abused her decades ago when they were young.
Ford also testified in a case about the woman's allegations.
The president said Saturday that "Americans saw the intelligence and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on the same day.
"The vote to prove Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to prove one of the legally complete intelligence of our times, a lawyer with a good public record," he told the West Virginia crowd.
The President referred to Kavanaugh's nomination indirectly when he spoke about the need for Republicans to appear to vote in representative elections.
"Five weeks from now one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running for, but from another perspective I'm running for the truth," he said.
"That's what I'm going around everywhere to beat debe good candidates."
Trump said that Democrats are willing to "disappeare and prevent."
The first important organizational vote in the Senate regarding Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place before Friday, the GOP's chief executive assistant has told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in earthquake, Indonesia's tsunami and death toll
At least 3<0x38>4 people were killed, many were embargoed when large waves reached the beach, while a massive earthquake and tsunami shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a ceremony on the coast in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-foot (1<0x38> m) wave struck land at night and swinged many and destroyed everything there was.
Tsunami followed a magnitude <0x37>.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the coast and did not run immediately and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster prevention agency BNPB said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunami did not come alone, it came with cars drilling, logs, houses, affected everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had toured the open sea at a speed of <0x38>00 kph (49<0x37> mph) before attacking the coast.
Other people planted trees to avoid tsunami and saved themselves, he said.
Around 1<0x36>,<0x37>00 people were evacuated to 24 stations in Palau.
Space scenes released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, bridges were overturned and sank by a water-covered mosque.
Small vibrations continued to be heard in the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were heard in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Bureau of Assessment and Applications of Technology (BPPT) said in a report that the energy released by a massive Friday earthquake was nearly 200 times the force compared to an atomic bomb detonated Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, which is found at the end of a narrow tsunami, may have caused an increase in tsunami, said.
Nugroho described the state of the destruction as being "double" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels were destroyed.
. Some bodies of the victims were found trapped in the debris of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be the largest along the coast 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, the area known as Donggala , which is close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely dismantled without any information" from Donggala , Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that workers and volunteers were heading towards affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but it may be worse," it said.
The organisation on Saturday was widely criticized for not not announcing that a tsunami had attacked Palu , although leaders said waves arrived shortly after the warning was issued.
In a non-professional video shared in social media, a man in the top floor of a building can be heard shouting of a tsunami warning approaching people on the road.
Within a few minutes the water waves reach the coast and carry buildings and vehicles.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm this video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused the loss of electricity in a wide area which interrupted communications near Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo aircraft and aid from Jakarta and other towns, authorities said, but the evacuated still need food and other basic needs.
The town's airport is only open with relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit rescue stations in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's Tsunami's death toll rises over <0x38>00.
It's Too Bad.
While World Vision workers from Donggala were safely successful in the town of Palu, where workers are protecting themselves from the tent set out of their office, they went through incidents of major damage along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of homes destroyed" he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even though aid groups began charitable activities, some complained that foreign workers with deep expert expertise were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, money, equipment and staff abroad can only begin to enter if the disaster declares nationality.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government has said, "Well, this is a national disaster," we can open up to international help but there is still no such situation."
When the second night hit the city of Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and family of those who had lost were hoping that their loved ones would get playing and make you a miracle in their hopeless stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was found from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been under debris for two days and her mother's body near her.
Gendon Subandono , the coach of the national umbrella team of Indonesia, had taught two of the umbrella players who have lost for the Asian Games, which was completed this month in Indonesia.
Others stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel, together Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a leader in the field of umbrella jumping, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon described how, hours after information about the Roa Roa Hotel spread between the community of participants in the umbrella jumping game, he had sent WhatsApp messages to Palu's rivals, who were participating in the coastal festival.
His message, however, showed one grey mark, rather than two blue markers.
"I think that means that the message was not read," he said.
Thieves take <0x24>2<0x36>,<0x37>50 while filling ATM at Levee's Newport

Kanye West: Photographer changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes its name to - Yes.
Announcing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A creature officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
This change takes place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He takes over the role of singer Ariana Grande on the show who sung for "emotional reasons ," the show's producer said.
Despite being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the term has a religious significance for him.
"I believe 'he' is a widely used term in the Bible, and in the Bible means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the name of his album and radio producer Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm we, it's us.
It changed from Kanye, which means a unique person, and to be just Ye - to be an example of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more an example of how we are."
He's one of the famous rappers who changed their names
Sean Combs was often known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his privileges under the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West member, JAY-Z, has also had to use his name with a lower line or without a large letter.
Mexico's POWER promises not to use military against civilians
Mexico's elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has never promised to use an army against civilians while the country is about to commemorate 50 years since the massacre had been bloody against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlateolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to deal with the Mexicans."
The troops shot at a peace march in the building on October 2, 19<0x36><0x38>, killing about 300 people while the movement of left-wing students was rooting in South American countries.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youth by providing monthly suspension to students and opening unprecedented public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join crime gangs.
The United States should double A.I. funding.
While China continues to be more involved in bureaucratic intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money it spends in research in the field of hio, said AI investor and expert, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Opinions come after various U.S. government units made announcements about the AI, even though the United States generally lacks the AI's official strategy.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: and intends to be number 1 in the discovery of AI by 2030.
"Increasing double the AI budget will be a good start, due to the situation that all other countries are behind the US and we are looking for new innovations in the AI," Lee said.
Adding double money can double the chance that the next AI's big success will be held in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: : China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most popular AI companies in China, Face <0x2B>.
In the 19<0x38>0s at Carnegie Mellon University he created an AI system that won Othello's top-level U.S. player and later became active in Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch of China.
Lee agreed that the previous US government technology competition as of the Robotics Association in the Deep Defence Research Programs and requested to know when another contest would be, to help identify future professionals.
Researchers in the United States often have to do extra work to get federal aid, Lee said.
"It's not China taking professional leaders, it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired stars from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said a change in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the AI.
"I think green cards should be issued directly to PhD students in AI," he said.
The Chinese Country Committee released its Development Program in Artificial Intelligence in July 201<0x37>.
The National Institutes of Natural Sciences of China donates money to people in educational institutions similar to how Natural Science Foundations and other government agencies donate money to American researchers, but the quality of professional work is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Center for Intelligence in Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage partners from the sector and academics and the White House announced the creation of the Board of Investigations in Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in a deal called AI Next.
For the NSF, it currently offers more than <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law that wanted to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken place for months now.
Macedonian referendum on country name change
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday regarding the change of its name to the "North Macedonia Republic," a move that could resolve a multi-year conflict with Greece that prevents its request of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has maintained that the name of neighboring countries in the north represents a claim to its province and has opposed the country's request as a member of NATO and EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June according to the proposed new name, but national antagonists say the change will negotiate the ethnic recognition of many Salvonians in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in a referendum and a campaign to ignore voting has caused doubts about whether the number of voters will reach the 50<0x25> required for the referendum to be correct.
The question in the referendum reads: "Do you support NATO and EU membership and accept an agreement with Greece."
Followers of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a suitable bail to be paid to be accepted into agencies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries formed from Yugoslavia's dissolution.
"I've come today to vote for the future of the country, for the Macedonian youth so they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because the hiatus means a safe life for all of us," said <0x37>9-year-old Olive Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally recognized, enough members of the legislature have said they will support the results of the vote to make it more serious.
The name change will require support from two thirds of the vote in parliament.
The federal election commission has said that there have been no reports of violations by seven in the afternoon.
However, the number of voters was only 1<0x36><0x25>, compared to 34<0x25> in the previous parliamentary election in 201<0x36> while <0x36><0x36><0x25> of registered voters voted.
""I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski , <0x36>2, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted for a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name to a move that will open the way to NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia on September 30, 201<0x38>.
In front of Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was providing a small platform and organizing seats in front of tents created by those who would oppose the referendum.
"We join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join in love, not through the back door for pressure" said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our respect.
If they don't want to recruit us like Macedonia, we can join others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian cooperation."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has a 20<0x25> unemployment rate.
"I believe a large number will support because <0x38>0<0x25> of our citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that the result of "yes" would be "a proof of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research said between 30<0x25> and 43<0x25> of voters will participate in a referendum <0xE2><0x80><0x93> below the required level .
Another study, conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV , found that 5<0x37><0x25> of participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, <0x37>0<0x25> said they will vote yes.
For a referendum to raise the number of voters it should be 50<0x25> and one vote.
Failure in the referendum will represent the first major blow to a government policy leaning on the West since it took control in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero surrounds the whole of Brighton and closes them
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling humiliated Brighton's defenders in a match which Manchester City won 2<0xE2><0x80><0x93>0 Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very easy when he tied the bats in the <0x36>5th minute.
The Argentine attacker found a passport in the middle of the field and launched a series.
He passed between Brighton's three beaks, before penetrating into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players.
He pushed one beck and then faster at the corner of Brighton's gate box.
He then scored a pass in his left side, finding Sterling.
The British attacker used his touch first in the box and returned the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot around the gate guard of Brighton Mathew Ryan and a screw into the right side of the net.
"Aguero faces some problems in his legs," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55 minutes, <0x36>0.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have tied them at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first control in the Premier League match.
The score was closed in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a ball inside the Brighton area in the attack.
He made a good bowling pass through the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touchdowns before giving him a pass to Sterling on the other side of the gate.
The Sky Blues attacker touched the ball into the net before starting to celebrate.
City are battling Hoffenheim in a match for the Mabingw League groups at 11:55pm Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a destroyer against. Rockies
While the Nationals had already been eliminated from the match, he had no other reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer who is so competitive uses us to be a block on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a major impact on the cut to the Rockies, who are proud to have one game that they haven't played against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies won the playoffs by winning 5<0xE2><0x80><0x93>2 against the National on Friday night, but are still looking for the first crown in the bridge.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can play a hard game in terms of the situation it will be here in Denver and the crowd and the other team hiatus will be playing at the highest level at every level I will face this year .
Why don't I want to compete at that level?"
Nationals have not yet announced players to start the game on Sunday, but say they have liked to allow Scherzer to shoot the ball in the situation.
Scherzer, who would be starting his 34th game, had a flying practice on Thursday and would be flying on his rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-handed batsman has 1<0x38><0xE2><0x80><0x93><0x37> with an average of 2.53 runs and 300 points of elimination by hitting in 220 2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>3 runs this season.
Trump makes a rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation facing his elector Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court when he spoke of the need for Republican sons to emerge in the representative elections.
"All the success we got is at risk in November.
Five weeks from the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big elections -- I am not running but from another perspective I am running for the truth and that's why I'm going around to beat the debe good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see what they are doing right now.
And they have decided to take power by using any possible means, you can see fatigue, vice.
They don't care about people who hurt them, who mistake him for power and control, what they want is power and control, we can't give them."
He said, democrats are willing to "follow and prevent."
"And you can see it in the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats to be people of "the anger and the wrath and the perverse and the liars."
He mentioned a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who is Dianne Feinstein by name, which caused the audience to bite him.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you uncover the document in the wrong way?
Uh, uh, what it is.
No, not, I waited one <0xE2><0x80><0x93> that was the weakest language of the body <0xE2><0x80><0x93> the worst language I've ever witnessed."
The Leba Party is no longer a church.
It doesn't tolerate free ideas
While Momentum activists in the party of my territory voted to remove me, it was not so strange.
After all, I am one in the line of Leba MPs to be told that we are not wanted - all by saying our ideas.
My partner in parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because he stood for his rebellion against Jewish discrimination.
In my case, the proposal to remove me scared me in disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of appropriate economic policy, regarding national security, about the issue of Europe, it is that the issues are similar to what Jeremy differs from previous leaders.
A report to the Leba conference in East Nottingham on Friday explained that "we want the meetings to be both efficient and effective."
For more than eight years as Local Football MP, GC's Friday night meetings have been fully included.
Unfortunately today, it did not resemble many meetings and the promise of politics "slow, generous" has long been forgotten if, indeed, had begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not accepted in the Leba party and all views are taken well if only accepted by party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as my colleague who I was thinking we share the same political perspective began to expect me to completely change ideas and take positions I would never agree with - whether it is about national security or a single market in the European Union.
Whenever I speak publicly <0xE2><0x80><0x93> and it doesn't matter what I'm saying <0xE2><0x80><0x93> what follows is an insult in social media and an effort to want me not to be elected, to reject middle-class politics, and tell me that I shouldn't be in the Leba Party.
And it's not the situation I've gone through alone.
Surely, I know I'm more lucky than my colleagues because the views directed to me are political.
I have a great respect for the skill and expression of my colleagues who face sexual or color every day but never give up.
One of the most devastating things in modern politics is how the levels of abuse are considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Leba Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we no longer belong to the church juishi and for every debate blahs "untrust" or changes in the principles of selection, the party becomes the narrowest in the integration.
I've got a lot of advice over the last two years being urged to settle down, don't be too much talking and that "I'm going to be okay."
But I didn't enter politics to do it.
Since I joined the Leba Party 32 years ago as a school student, due to the incentive to be ignored by the government of Thatcher which left my school class full almost falling, I have struggled to fight for better public services for those who need it most <0xE2><0x80><0x93> whether it be a regional councillor or a government minister.
I have not hidden the kind of my politics, including in the previous elections.
None in East Nottingham could be confused about attitudes in policy and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who brought forward debate on Friday, all I'll say is that when the country is about to leave the European Union amalgamate Brexit, a move that will hurt our families, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the Leba Party leader.
But in fact one message is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to the citizens in my area, whether members of the Leba Party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that there is no amount of threats to deletion or political fitness that will prevent me from considering what I believe is of the best interest for all of you.

Ayr 3<0x38> - 1<0x37> Melrose: Ayr's unidentified team still takes first place in the table
Two attempts in the final period may have changed to some degree the final results, but there is no doubt that Ayr qualified to win in this highly anticipated tennis League match.
Now they lead the table, the only team that has not failed.
Eventually, it was their best defence , as well as the use of their positions, which helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie had the right to satisfaction.
"We have been tried in our games so far, and we have not yet failed, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they used their best chances to settle."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, tied with Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card to Scottish teammate Rory Hughes, offered for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to use the opportunity to have multiple players and Jason Baggot scored a try which
Climo added Ayr's lead to the penalti, just before the break, scored and then completed a try on his own and made the score 1<0x37><0xE2><0x80><0x93>5 for Ayr during the break.
But Melrose started well the second half with Patrick Anderson's attempt, tied with Baggot, reducing the lead by five points.
The game was then temporarily suspended after a dangerous injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was eliminated being carried and when the game was renewed, Ayr added his lead to the Stafford McDowall attempt, tied by Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and again, Melrose used the chance to have one more player and tied for Bruce Colvine's attempt, at the end of the high pressure period.
The home team took control again, however, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card by playing for Climo without the ball and from the penalti line out, MacPherson scored from a strong attack from Ayr.
Climo scored, how he was doing after the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's scout and stabbed Gregor Henry and scored a fifth try for the home team.
Still Game star takes up new jobs in the restaurant sector
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to have entered the housing sector after it is discovered that he has been appointed as director of a confirmed restaurant company.
The 5<0x36>-year-old star plays under the name Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show, in which he is the writer and co-star of his longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next nine series will be the last in the show and Kiernan apparently has another plan in life after Craiglang .
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun newspaper source claimed that Kiernan was expecting to be involved in the "very growing restaurant business "in Glasgow."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia that has no port hopes the court will open access to the Pacific Ocean
The patrol crew at the sea headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have installed a blue flag like a sea.
Sea stations from Lake Titicaca to Amazon have been written to say: "The sea is ours right.
Restoring it is a duty."
Throughout the portless Bolivia, the memory of the coastal zone that lost it to Chile in the 19th century resource crisis is still clear - just as much as the desire to travel again in the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps the hope is currently the highest for many years, with Bolivia pending the international justice court ruling on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has speed, a spirit of unity and calm and really expects a positive attitude for the results," said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat.
The majority of Bolivian citizens will look at ICJ's decision on a large screen across the country, citing that a court in The Hague will make a decision that accepts Bolivia's claims - after decades of appropriate talks - Chile will be forced to discuss the move to give Bolivia a way to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivian natural president - who faces a fierce confrontation in re-election next year - also has much to do with Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he swore in late August.
But other critics believe that there is little chance that the court will give a decision that suits Bolivia - and that there will be very little changes even if it decides so.
The Dutch-based organisation has no authority to relinquish Chile's territory to other countries, and has said that it cannot determine the outcome of the negotiations expected to take place.
The ICJ decision will be issued just six months after the final debate suggests that the case is "not a metallurgy," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate , a Chilean expert in international law.
And besides promoting Bolivia's hopes, the last four years may have brought it back.
"The issue of sea access is exploited by the current Bolivian regime," said Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate .
Morales' political remarks have ended Chile's remaining goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some point they will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged diplomats since 19<0x36>2.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9> , a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions were too fast.
On Monday it will give Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a position to "severe 139 years of diversity for joint benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in the South United States - was using the maritime issue as a political stream.
"Bolivia will never give up on its right to reach the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we need to go forward."
North Korea says the removal of nuclear weapons will not be possible unless it has faith with the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation will never remove its nuclear weapons first if it cannot be trusted with Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called for the United States to follow the promises it made during a meeting in Singapore between opposition leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to re-establish nuclear diplomacy that had not been successful for more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean president Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "little dream" that promoting US sanctions and opposition to a report ending the Korean War will ever make the North weak.
Washington is afraid to accept information without Pyongyang first making necessary removal measures.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump all want a second meeting.
But there is great doubt that Pyongyang is considering the removal of weapons that the country considers as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to host Kim-Trump's second meeting.
Style exhibitions in Paris show modern head equipment headers head-to-head access to the Royal Stores near you
If you want to add a collection of your caps or completely block the sun then you have given a solution.
Professional Valentino and Thom Browne launched a very large head-to-head equipment in their collection SS19 at a stage show that surprised them creatively at the Style Week in Paris.
The caps that are hard to create have attracted many on Instagram this summer and these designers have offered these beautiful caps to be used on the fashion platform.
Valentino's impressive charm was of a tantanned hat placed on broad feather-like edges that covered the models' heads.
Other major tools include samples of a wet, a witch's hat and even pineapple - but they are not designed to give your head warm.
Thom Browne also exposed strange bastards <0xE2><0x80><0x93> by the time Halloween is approaching.
Many colored survivors had lips stitched and resembled Hannibal Lecter than fashion skills
One design was similar to a cycling cycling device with a sample and glasses, while the other was similar to a melted ice cream cone.
And if you're going to keep up with a big statement of style <0xE2><0x80><0x93> you're lucky.
Fashion viewers predict that big hoods can be on the way to come to luxury stores around you.
The giant hats offer creativity in 'La Bomba', a bouquet hat with edges of a two-dimensional width and lead everyone to wear it from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Lobo fans created this complex hat that was released on social media made another top design used on a mobile platform of size-based styles using the model of swimming clothing
The orange ruffia bag, placed on the edge and leather handle, was the most interesting in Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and pockets coming to stores next summer heat <0xE2><0x80><0x93> because the architect has brought a huge impact that will be difficult to ignore the needs of large equipment.'
John Edward: Language knowledge is essential to international citizens
Uscoti's independent schools continue to maintain a record of professional skills and this has continued in 201<0x38> with another set of best exam results, which are reinforced by personal and collaborative achievements in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
In addition to an increase of more than 30,000 students in the Uscoti, these schools, represented by the Board of Independent Schools in the Uscoti (the popular SCIS), are struggling to provide a better level of service for students and parents.
Independent schools aim to provide their students with higher education and higher education, professions they choose and their position as international citizens.
As an educational sector that can create and implement a specialized school course, we see modern languages becoming popular and a preferred subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in the language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his native language that goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships with people from other countries.
Due to the recent results of this year's exam, we can see that languages lead the league table with high score levels in independent schools.
A total of <0x36><0x38><0x25> of foreign-learning students received an A high score.
Data collected from <0x37>4 SCIS schools, showed that <0x37>2<0x25> of students obtained a high A mark in Mandarin and <0x37>2<0x25> for German learners, <0x36>9<0x25> for those learning French and <0x36>3<0x25> of Spanish learners also received A.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will need in their future.
Languages now, as a selective subject, are considered at the same rate as STEM courses (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school courses and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the British Commission in Aids and Skills in 2014 found that one of the reasons employers said they found when they had difficulty filling jobs, 1<0x37><0x25> was associated with lack of language skills .
So more and more, language skills become important to provide young people with their later professions.
While many work opportunities are needed in language, this knowledge is essential in the globalization world.
Regardless of the profession one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will find more realistic space in the future to have a knowledge of life like this.
Having the ability to communicate directly with foreign people will place a person who speaks a variety of languages forward in competition.
According to YouGov's study of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, <0x37>5<0x25> were unable to speak a good foreign language in order to promote a French language that is the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, 15<0x25>.
This is why investing in language training is now essential for current children.
Having a lot of languages, specifically those of developing countries, will give children a good chance to find meaningful employment.
Within Uscoti, each school will have a different language that teaches.
Several schools will consider more modern languages, where others will teach languages that appear to be the most important for Britain in the future until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be a number of choice languages in independent schools, as well as training professionals in this field.
Uscoti's independent schools offer to provide a learning environment that will provide children and provide the skills needed to succeed, regardless of their later professions.
It cannot be challenged that at this time, in the state of international trade, that languages continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this should be shown in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "an international knowledge of communication."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, differing from quality to Uscoti's youth.
Il faut bien this is fair.
John Edward is the Director of the Board of Independent Schools in Scotland
LeBron played his first game with the Lakers Sunday at San Diego
During the wait you're about to end with fans eager to see LeBron James play the first match as a Los Angeles Lakers player.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the pre-season match on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than a minute and less than 4<0x38>," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers writer Mike Trudell described in the tweet that James could play a few minutes.
Following rehearsals earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in Lakers' "six pre-season games.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my game to be ready," he said.
Trump's Political Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Center
Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five conferences scheduled to take place next week, including standing in areas where he has many supporters including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote to prove still suspended about who appointed him to fill the position of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support in the elections as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes will be cast in November.
How many hours will the Trump rally in West Virginia be and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at <0x37> p.m. Eastern hours tonight, Saturday, September 29, 201<0x38>.
You can watch West Virginia's Trump meeting online via live stream on YouTube.
There is a possibility that Trump will discuss a case that will take place this week about Supreme Court selector Brett Kavanaugh, which has brought much concerns about the allegations of sexual abuse that led to a temporary suspension of Senate confirmation vote for one week while the FBI investigates.
But the goal of this conference stand is to beat debe candidates for the Republicans in the November election to gain more popularity.
Thus, President Trump's campaign committee said these five meetings in the coming week are aiming to empower volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Senate control is important for his agenda so the president will travel in as many states as possible as we approach the season of further campaign activities," a spokesman for the Trump campaign committee who refused to be identified told Reuters.
As scheduled to take place at Wesbanco Square in Wheeling, a meeting tonight can bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and the Pittsburgh press broadcast," according to West Virginia's Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month when Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by over 40<0x25> of the vote in 201<0x36>.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is back in the poll.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must arrive to try to improve his position in the election," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 201<0x38>: U.S. team shows off-site keeping hopes heading into one-man game on Sunday
After three points in one direction, the game of two players for two Saturday afternoons may be the excitement that the Ryder Cup needs
The course of cynicism is a fully developed concept of games but which players believe in truth and even more in competitions like this
So they're going to say where it's heading now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we take that as a little speed I think," said Jordan Spieth after concluding the day.
Europe has a better chance, of course, they are ahead with four scores, praying twelve of the struggle.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have extra strength and have much to encourage them, also taking into account Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and everyone is proud of three out of four points.
Spieth has been dangerous from the beginning of the game to the game hole and leads by being a role model.
The majority of the celebration noise increased as his turn continued, inserting the ball after hitting the ball to the hole and balancing as he and Thomas were down with two points after two turns.
His ball to the hole won a 15-hole match and got a lot of fun to celebrate, which shows you believe that the American team has not yet died.
"You really have to be diligent and focus on your own match," Spieth said.
Now that's all these players have left to do now.
1<0x38> holes are waiting for them to show this.
The only players with more scores than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unexplained story of the Ryder Cup.
The phenomenon from Europe has four tracks out of four and has currently made no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that did not hit the ball more times on Saturday afternoons, but also avoided hitting the ball more times on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That quality, and how their strength seems to increase between them and the crowd proves that the players will give the highest competition on Sunday and perhaps no other notable players can win for Europe when the day ends in Le Golf National if not Fleetwood or Molinari.
If they all do so at the same time in different holes.
It is very early to discuss the victory for Europe, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dealt accordingly with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in the game of the two against the two, when he formed a pair with Alex Noren.
Additional balls and two more balls in nine opening holes put the Spaniard and the Swiss in a situation that was difficult from.
Sunday, however, no one can break you into the situation you will get into.
The game two against two is very exciting to watch closely because of the collaboration between pairs, the advice they offer, the advice they don't give and how strategy can change on the spot.
Europe has made it better as a team so far and took a big lead towards the final day but this pair-up show has also shown that the U.S. team has a fight that some, especially those in the United States, were skeptical.
Europe leads 10<0xE2><0x80><0x93><0x36> in Ryder Cup final
Europe would have a good chance in the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning in a pair match and four balls by 10<0xE2><0x80><0x93><0x36> against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the game with two wins against Tiger Woods who appeared to be overwhelmed and brought their total scores to the present on Le Golf National as four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to pray and a shell they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, led the United States that appeared to be overwhelmed in a four-game game in the morning, winning the series 3<0xE2><0x80><0x93>1.
The United States gave more opposition in pair matches against pairs and won two matches, but were unable to eliminate deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to pray with a shell.
Fleetwood was the first new player in Europe to win four consecutive points when he and Mollinari, called "Molliwood" after the thrilling weekend became only the second pair to win four points from their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball match they collaborated well and defeated Wood and American Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who was back in both matches on Saturday, showed good play sessions but has now lost 19 of 29 matches in four balls and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who rested for a four-game match in the morning, returned to team with Henrik Stenson in a pair match and lost 2 and 1 with Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - listed in the first and third place in the world.
Europe did not get everything though the day was good, with a striking wind in southwest Paris.
The three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the category for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in a pair game after losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup where the team has managed from behind by four points to one man's game, though Furyk's team only needs to get out of uniforms to pray with a shell.
After being in second place for two days, however, the winning battle on Sunday seems to be away from them.
North Korea says it 'impossible' will remove weapons without having faith that others will do what they should.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was further undermining confidence in the United States and no way the country could remove its nuclear weapons without others to do what they should under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "good measures of good intentions" the previous year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, breaking a nuclear test center and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Within no faith from the United States there will be no confidence in our national security in such a situation and there is no way we will remove our weapons first without others doing what they should."
While Ri reaffirmed North Korea's complaint regarding Washington's opposition to the "step" approach by removing nuclear weapons where North Korea would get a vaccination if it took a small step, his report seemed important since it did not refuse the action to remove nuclear weapons on terms how Pyongang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint report by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the current President of the United States and North Korean leader Singapore on June 12, while Kim promised to work to "shoot nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking formal suluhu for the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States says Pyongyang must remove its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also refused a call to end international sanctions against North Korea.
"U.S. insists" first the removal of nuclear weapons" and increases the pressure level by using sanctions to achieve their goal through force and even resisting the "last declaration of war," Ri said.
"The view that obstacles may not undermine are an impossible dream from people who ignore us.
But the problem is that ongoing barriers continue to disbelief.
"Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader touched in the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead shone three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If a partner in this issue of removing nuclear syslas would be South Korea and not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula would not be in this case."
However, Ri's speech was somewhat different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the action to target the US mainland and North Korean rockets would not be avoided after "Mr. Evil President" Trump referred to Kim as "a rocket man" aimed at carrying out the killings.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "severe damage" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking measures to disarm, but said a major task still should be done and sanctions should pray until North Korea remove nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia say the United Nations Security Council should call Pyongyang on the steps it took.
However, the U.S. Foreign Secretary told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "The implementation of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue in detail and without fail until we find full, final and certified removal of nuclear weapons."
Together, the Security Council has increased sanctions against North Korea since 200<0x36> in an effort to remove funds for Pyongyang's nuclear plans and missiles.
Pompeo met Ri after the UN General Assembly later said that he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his final trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress has taken place, but only within several hours North Korea accused him of giving "the terms as a criminal."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it will destroy both a missile station and a nuclear weapons center if the United States takes "related measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "related measures" he was wanting to be a security assurance that Trump promised in Singapore and towards strengthening relationships with Washington.
Harvard students are trained in getting enough rest.
A new lesson at Harvard University this year requires all undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to combat the culture of making gentlemen and reading for 'all night' with coffee assistance.
‘The expert discovered students at the number one university in the world are not knowledgeable about the basic question about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created the subject, which he believes is the first form in the United States.
. He was incorporated as creating a lesson after giving a lecture on how poor sleep affects training.
'At the end of the speech, one girl came to me and said, 'Why are I just told these things now, in my last year?'
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The lesson, which has been first introduced this year, explains the students basics about how a good sleep style helps in professional and sporting activities as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of intelligence at Harvard School of Medicine and the managing director of university healthcare, said that the university decided to start the subject after finding out that students were very sleepy in the week.
The clock-long lesson involves a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is a picture of the bedroom, where students press for coffee, curtains, shoes and books and are described about the effects of coffee and light and how sports activities are affected by lack of sleep and the importance of sleep schedule.
In other places, participants are told how long-term insomnia can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, malnutrition and cancer.
A college map and aikon associate, then urges participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know the lesson won't change the student behavior at once.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the harm to health when you smoke, 'Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in 'slow' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and pressure on students that are growing means sleeplessness was an ongoing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep, well quality, you should be a student's 'secret weapon' to deal with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoiding weight, because insomnia makes the mind in a state not satisfied with making you hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who learns physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create a subject, after participating in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the subject opened his eyes to him as a whole college formation.
The next step, he accepts, is to ask all graduate students to make a corresponding lesson before joining a highly competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should consider placing a sleeping bell as well as a bell on awakening and aware of the effects of the 'blue light' provided by electrical screens and LED lighting, which can damage the brain clock and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1<0xE2><0x80><0x93>0 Rangers: The Menga bats Gerrard's youngsters
The Rangers were again defeated in another outdoor game when Dolly Menga's scrapped Steven Gerrard's team appeared to be overwhelmed by a 1<0xE2><0x80><0x93>0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team was aiming to win the first foreign victory since a 4<0xE2><0x80><0x93>1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard to lose for the second time in 1<0x38> games as manager and left his team with eight points behind the Ladbrokes League leaders, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break and the Rangers never looked like it would equalise.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and are behind Hibernian only with a golf difference.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after the flagship catcher Calum Spence needs treatment after suffering a head injury to something fired from Rangers.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that tied Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used all 11 players who got uniforms against Hearts last week and would be pleased with how well prepared his team faced their opponents every time.
The Rangers had more ball possession but Livingston took advantage of their positions when they got the ball.
They were to close only the second minute when the first Menga ball gave Scott Pittman a chance towards Allan McGregor's gate but the interception threw the ball out.
A catch from Keaghan Jacobs got captain Craig Halkett but his teammate in defence Alan Lithgow was only able to hit it out of goal.
The Rangers took control but their game appeared only with confidence but not confidence as they approached the closing zone.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he would have to get a penalti in the 15th minute after being hit by Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson said the game would continue even after the Colombian claim.
The Rangers managed to hit two wickets in the goal during the first half but former Ibrox gate defender Liam Kelly would not be too stressed by a head ball from Lassana Coulibaly and a weak hurdle from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's goal in the 34th minute was not due to a regular game, no one can refuse to qualify for the win.
Again the Rangers failed to face a catch ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who was strong and hit the ball towards the toucher and shut down.
Gerrard made a decision during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the move was about to get the result when the interception left the ball to Morelos but Kelly ran away from his part and blocked the ball.
But Livingston kept disrupting visitors and made them play their way, with Lithgow and Halkett hit a long ball next.
The Holt team could add a goal in the final minutes but McGregor was solid and blocked Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball out with the head.
Rangers' reserve player Glenn Middleton had another Penalti claim in the final minutes when they faced Jacobs but again referee Thomson ignored the request away.
Stage of the Year: Geiger Counter's inventor
And now a page from our annual "Sunday Sunday morning": September 30, 1<0x38><0x38>2, 13<0x36> years ago today, and continued KUHESABU ... the day after future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radiation, an invention that ultimately led to the creation of a device known as Geiger Counter.
The foundation of science ever since, Geiger Counter's instrument became popular in popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bell of Coronado," which included scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that in this world?"
Rogers: "It's a Counter Geiger device, it's used to detect bamboo minerals, such as uranium.
When putting these head tools, you can hear the effects of atoms given by the consumer into minerals."
Evans: "Say, it's started to sound now!"
Hans "Geiger died in 1945, just days before his <0x36>3th birthday.
But the discovery named after him survives.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system 'seeing' bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' the wrong cell and kill
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of the treatment
The technique involves cooling immune cells from the patient, altering them in the laboratory
Then they can 'see' a protein that is popular in most cancers and then re-installed.
Experimental vaccine shows positive results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with vaccination, which teaches the immune system to identify a bad cell, was able to treat her ovarian cancer for more than 1<0x38> months.
This method involves cooling immune cells from the patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the normal protein for most of the HER2 cancers, and then replacing the cells.
. Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Saturn Institute of America in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a highly reliable vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancers," including breast cancer, ovarian, lungs and pulmonary and tumours, Prof Berzofsky described.
Such a method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" how to target cancer cells has worked in treating leukemia.
Kanye West Has Begin a Long Critic With Criticism to Support Trump, Wearing a MAGA Coffee, After Appearances in the SNL Period.
It didn't go Good.
Kanye Kanye West was cast in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a high-profile show where she praised U.S. President Donald Trump and stated that he could take office in 2020.
After a performance of his third song for that night, called Ghost Town where he was wearing a cap written on Make America Great, he began to rebuke the Democrats and promised support for Trump.
"When I talk to a white man he says, "How can you love Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism I would leave the United States very long ago," he said.
The SNL season began with short performances that included Matt Damon where the Hollywood star sarcastically criticised Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Committee on allegations of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the event was not announced, West's content was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock tried to impress West for the publication.
West had also complained to the audience that he had had a hard time before entering the stage in connection with his hat.
"They treated me badly behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go there with that hat.'
You bullied him!
And then they said that I am in a situation where I have sunk," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see a place to sink?" stating that he will wear my brave hero's hat, because this means you can't tell me what I'm right to do. What do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments challenged at least twice from an audience and SNL staff who seemed embarrassed, the Variety Center reported, and one person there reporting the publication: "The whole Studio went quite silent."
West had been brought in to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-girlfriend, scouting Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West surprised many when he sang the song I Love it, dressed as a bottle of Perrier's water.
West was joined by conservative group leader TPUSA, Candice Turner who published tweet: "To one of the most brave people: ASANTE FOR THE COMMUNITY."
But the talk show host Karen Hunter published a tweet that West was simply "showing his attitude and that that's a very good thing."
"But I choose another person (by purchasing his music or clothing or supporting his "store") who I believe agrees to spread a belief that is dangerous to my community.
He is free.
Even we too," he added.
Prior to the show, the hacker announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the tracks of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has changed to Snoop Lion and undoubtedly the late Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist previously known as Prince.

Star of the Game of Thrones Kit Harington applauds Toxic Males
Kit Harington starred as Jon Snow in the HBO's Game of Thrones series.
But the actor, 31, has rebuked the opium of masculinity, saying the roles on screen mean little boys often feel like they should be hard to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something that's damaged in place' and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted to feeling a 'plenty' in dealing with this issue.
'I feel personally, at full strength, at the moment - where are we wrong in the issue of masculinity?', He said.
'What have we been teaching men as they grow up, according to the issue of the problem we see now?'
'Kit believes that television can be a part of an increase in toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
He continued: 'What's natural and what's taught?
Is that taught on television, and in the streets, which makes little boys feel they should be a man of this kind?
I think that's one of the biggest questions we live in this time - how are we going to change that?
Because things are certainly going out of our youth.
In an interview he also admitted that he would no longer be involved in the preliminary and follow-up episodes of Game of Thrones when the series ends next season, saying he is satisfied with the battlefield with horses.
From November Kit will be involved in a film from Sam Shepard True West which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a thief.
The character recently revealed that the action to meet with his wife Rose was the best result of his involvement in the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife during this period, in that way I found my future family, and my life from there,' he said.
Rose starred as Ygritt , the love interest of the character Jon Snow who played as Kit, in a series of hardcore that won the Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 201<0x38> on the property property property of the Leslie Scottish family.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14<0x25> increase in new case
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and Agriculture.
Over <0x38>20,000 people have been infected in the country, health leaders say.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 201<0x38>.
Many of the new episodes were caused by sex, and marked changes from the past.
Usually, HIV spread rapidly to other parts of China due to blood transfusions.
But the number of HIV infections in this way had declined to the scarf, Chinese health leaders said at a meeting in Yunnan province.
. However, the year after year, the number of HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual HIV infections are a serious issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality in China was legalized in 199<0x37>, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be too high.
Because of country's conservative values, studies have estimated that <0x37>0<0xE2><0x80><0x93>90<0x25> men in same-sex marriage eventually marry women.
Many epidemics come from the lack of use of immunity during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised access to all HIV drugs as part of an effort to deal with this issue.
Maxine Waters denied that her employee exposed the data of GOP senators, reprimanded 'critical lies' and 'investigative theories'
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that his employee published a personal comment of three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages of the MPs.
The Democrat MP from Los Angeles said the allegations were being spread by analysts and websites of "critical right-wing supporters".
"A lie, a lie, and a more meaningless lie," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The comments made are alleged to include home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The comments appeared online Thursday, were published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing charges of sexual abuse against Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure took place a few moments after the senators accused Kavanaugh.
Progressive areas such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that an IP address that recognizes the source of publication was linked to the Waters office and commented by a Waters worker, Hill reported.
"This stereotypical allegations are completely false and completely misleading," Waters continued.
"My employee <0xE2><0x80><0x93> whose identity, personal comments, and security has been affected by these allegations of fraud and falsehood <0xE2><0x80><0x93> was never involved in revealing this explanation.
The underlying claims are completely false and completely misleading."
Waters' report was quickly used online, including former News Minister at White House's Ari Fleischer's headquarters.
"This rejection is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the proper control of emotions to become a Congressional Commissioner.
When one is used for something that doesn't act, he shouldn't be angry.
You shouldn't be worried.
He shouldn't interview the applicant's motives.
He should be calm and unconcerned.
"Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' response to the criticism of Democrats against Justice Kavanaugh, who was used by critics for an angry appearance during a hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to remove Waters from representative elections, also published his ideas on Twitter.
"The big thing if it's true," he said to the tweet.
In a statement, Waters said his office had informed "proper jurisdictions and law enforcement agencies about these false claims.
"We will make sure that those who acted in this matter are exposed, "continued," and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are damaging and dangerous to everyone and all my employees."
Johnny English film review Strikes Again - a joke in Rowan Atkinson's detective
It is common to look at Brexit's effects in any new film leaning on Britain but this does not apply to the warmth of another comedy-war film by Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 by Johnny English Reborn.
Is the humor of personal jokes in the theme of how we're so ugly it would be a new opportunity abroad?
At any rate, Johnny English's eyebrows, a very moving face is licensed to make mistakes again in a second-formed way <0xE2><0x80><0x93> the name indicating his further gesture that he is designed with a wider humor for non-English people.
He is actually a chizi detective who despite the strange demands of a charming indifference reflects Clouseau's reputation, the credits of Mr Bean and the person who contributed to one of the scene music of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in London 2012.
Initially she was involved as a traveler and international comedian Atkinson was simultaneously involved in Barclaycard TV's forgotten broadcasts currently, leaving many as uninterested.
There's one or two things in this recent JE movie.
I liked to see Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a jacket suit of weapons and flats of ambiguity changing for a while over his hat.
Atkinson's talent in physical humor became evident here, but humor seems low and unnecessary, humasan because "great" films such as 00<0x37> and Mission Impossibility include humor as part of it.
The humor seems to be focused on children and not adults and confronted me with Johnny English's unique trips are not beneficiaries and has no focus on how the humor of Atkinson's silent films as the character Bean.
The annual assumption is now that Britain is in great trouble.
An online hacker has been able to enter the secret network of the British website and expose the identity of all British detectives out of work and surprise the detective at work <0xE2><0x80><0x93> it was very sadly a simple task for Kevin Eldon.
In his last moment as a grandmaster who faces much opposition and has already been severely affected in political fame: Emma Thompson does very well for her character corresponding to Teresa May but the story doesn't help her show these qualities.
His security advisers inform him that because the identity of each investigator has been exposed, he must use a retired man.
And that means using Johnny English himself, now employed as a school teacher in a magnificent school, but teaches informal lessons about how to be a secret detective: some good humor there, while English teaches surveillance similar to the School of Rock film.
English is reintroduced to Whitehall by an emergency meeting and joined by his ex-girlfriend Bough, reprised by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, associated with the commander of the fleet, an exciting position where Vicki Pepperdine is not involved should.
Thus the characters corresponding to Batman and Robin but by destroying things in the Kingdom Secret Service return to work and in line with Olga Kurylenko starring as Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister appears to be more involved in the spying of a financier who claims to be able to solve all the problems of technology in the United Kingdom: Jason Volta, voiced by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their most enjoyable journey : they pretend hotel ministers, set fire in a French noble restaurant; they start a riot and enter without permission in Volta's magnificent boat; and English causes cashe when trying to use the Improved Virtual Materials to learn
All breaks are undoubtedly removed for the final sequence, but regardless of the intensity and turbulent inclusion included, there are so many credits for children's sessions in the film hio.
Good peeks.
And just as it has other Johnny English films I had to think again: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice for his talent?
The Lebanese Party denies that it has a plan for the British to work four days but was paid for five days.
The Football Association led by Jeremy Corbyn will consider a sharp deal the British will work four days for wiku - but they were paid five days.
The party allegedly called for corporate leaders to pay the money saved through a pseudo-intelligence (AI) for workers by giving them an extra day.
It will encourage workers to grow up with three days of rest <0xE2><0x80><0x93> but they will still go home with the same income.
Sources said that the idea would be 'proper' to the party's economic agenda and plans to strengthen the country for workers.
Working four days a week has been supported by the Workers' Union Center as a means of employee taking the opportunity for a changing economy.
The main source of the Leba Party told The Sunday Times: 'A policy inspection is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't be done immediately but the four working days are equivalent to the party's attitude in balanceing the economy for workers as well as the overall party strategy for the sector.'
'The Leba Party will not be the first to propose a similar idea, the Green Party promised four working days a week during its 201<0x37> campaign for the general election.
Ari hio is currently not supported by all in the Leba Party, however.
A Leba Party spokesman said: 'Four days of work for a week is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party.'
Chansela alternative John McDonnell used the Leba summit last week to describe his vision of a socio-economic revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he had the determination to remove power from the 'invisible directors' and the 'rich' in the delivery companies.
Chansela's alternative plan also means that the current mathematicians in water companies will not be able to restore all their money because the Leba Government can do a 'discount' on the grounds of recognized errors.
He also confirmed that plans to place employees on the company boards and create Communities Ownership Finance to provide 10<0x25> of private companies' funds to employees, who will be able to earn an annual share of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy explains the "<0x36>0 Minutes" wiki if the FBI investigation against Kavanaugh can change their ideas
The FBI investigation into charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote in connection with his appointment in the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised the question if the FBI results can change the ideas of Republican senators to support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "<0x36>0 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Senators.with Republican John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that could cause them to change their ideas.
Kennedy appeared to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said going to the case, I said, I've talked to Justice Kavanaugh.
"I called after this happened, when the allegations came up, I said, 'Did you do that?'
He was firm, accurate."
However, Graham's vote seems to be unchanged.
"I've decided about Brett Kavanaugh and it'll take very severe charges," he said.
"Dk. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly refused, "Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford."
"And everyone involved could not prove.
It's 3<0x36> years now.
I don't see something new to change."
What's the Citizens Festival on Earth and Has It Made Anything To Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizens Festival, a music event that includes an interesting list of singing stars as well as the same message to appeal; to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizen Festival will lead to tens of thousands of people going to the Great Lawn area in Central Park not only enjoy stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also increase awareness for the true goal of the event to end 20 years of poverty by year.
The World Citizens Festival, which said in 2012 that it is a continuation of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that expects to end poverty by increasing the number of people facing directly against it.
In order to get a free event ticket (except if you would like to pay a VIP ticket), concert supporters had to complete a series of activities, or "acts" such as volunteers, sending emails to a global leader, calling or any other effort to help increase awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how has the World Citizens Festival been successful still 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of charging people with free concert tickets a real way to persuade people to push for action, or just another case of what is known as "only online activism" - people feel like they make a real difference by signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the World Citizens Festival says it has recorded more than 19 million "activities" from its supporters to different goals.
It says these actions have pushed world leaders to declare promises and policies equivalent to <0x24>3<0x37> billion that will change the lives of over 2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 201<0x38>, the group showed 390 promises and advertisements based on its actions, at least <0x24>10 billion already distributed or donated.
The group estimates the funds available so far that they have directly affected around <0x36>49 million people worldwide.
Some key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and donors in the United Kingdom aiming to "help children reach their full potential," promising 35 million grants to Rwanda to help stop malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,<0x37>00 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, national governments, and Citizens of the World like you, we can make social bullies of not having better nutrition to be just history," the Commissioner of Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a London live concert in April 201<0x38>.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 acts were completed in asking Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and better nutrition.
In response to a question in the <0x51>uestions and Answers section on his website asked "what makes you think we can end the poverty that affected you?"
Citizens of the World Citizens Festival replied: It will be a long and hard way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, it was with human rights activists and anti-racism groups in front of us, we will succeed, because we are strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e is one of the stars to sing at the event in New York, which locals will become Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy to "protect" export energy sales of Russia - Minister of the Interior
Washington may "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from being sold, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of Home Affairs Ryan Zinke has said, as described by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's participation in Syria - especially, where it works with an invitation to a legitimate government - is an excuse to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe their reason that the Middle East is to search for energy markets how they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and strategies to deal with it.
"The United Nations has such capabilities, along with our Navy, to ensure that seaways have been opened, and, if necessary, to prevent, to ensure their energy is not in the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants who attended the event organised by the User Energy League, a non-profit group that says that it represents "the sound of energy users" in the United States.
He continued and compared the ways Washington uses to deal with Russia and Iran, and said that the countries are similar.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, in accordance with the use and replacement of oil," he said, referring to Russia as "a little knowledgeable" and an economy based on coal oil.
The information comes at a time when Trump's administration has been on a mission to increase its natural gas sales to Europe and replace Russia, which has become a very cheap option for European users.
As a result, Trump administration leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project of the "Nord Stream 2," which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly maintained that Nord Stream 2's 11 billionth pipeline, which intends to double the current capacity of 110 billion volumes, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin states that much of Washington's opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy is inappropriate as a tool to make pressure and that users should be able to choose sellers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has been used by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German governing agency in the sector, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called for the United States to abstain from the EU's energy policy and the two countries' treaties between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem as the third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industrial Industry (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chansela Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "He'll Look Deep" to run for 2020 President, Massachusetts Senator Says
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday he could "loose deep" if he run for the presidency after the election of representatives.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could consider running for.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our damaged government and which includes a woman in power," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November <0x36>, I will take a deep look if I run for the presidency."
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city hall, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been heavily addressing his opposition to Trump and his Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh.
In the tweet he published on Friday, Warren said "we certainly need an FBI investigation before voting."
"A poll released on Thursday, however, showed to a large number of voters in the Warren area do not feel that he should run for 2020.
59<0x25> of the "able" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Political Research University.
Thirty-two percent supported similar nominations.
Research showed further support for former Governor Deval Patrick's nomination, with 3<0x38><0x25> supporting and 4<0x38><0x25> refusing.
Other notable names of Democrats considered potential candidates include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions stress caused by Threatening Track Palin at Donald Trump meeting
Track Palin, 2<0x36>, spent a year in Iraq after being registered in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic abuse incident on Monday night.
"My son is going through, what he reviews after returning, I can understand other families that are reviewing the effects of stress caused by a scary event and some of the effects that our soldiers return to," he told an audience at a Donald Trump meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin cited the point of arresting him as "an avoidable tyranny" and stated that his son and other war veterans, "returning separately, returning with a tough ideology, come back wondering if there is respect that they are astronauts and every other military ally, by his commitment to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with woman's domestic violence and affected the home abuse report and possession of weapons while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
1<0x38> states, DC supports new immigration policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support law opposition to a new U.S. policy that rejects asylum for victims running for crime or domestic violence.
Representatives from 1<0x38> states and districts filed a small friend-of-law statement on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers in opposition to policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace v. v. Sessions which was submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union held in August against country policy has not been disclosed.
He said his lover "and his sons members of a criminal group," persecuted him but U.S. officials rejected his asylum request on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Country attorneys in support of Grace described the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which provide a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, as nations facing problems with criminal groups and domestic abuse.
A new asylum policy in the United States reversed the 2014 decision by the Migration Board of Appeals which allowed unregistered immigrants running home abuse to be given asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a Friday report that a new policy "has ignored decades of state, state and international law."
"The country's law needs that all asylum demands be determined according to the facts and specific circumstances of the claim, and the rejection violates the principle," said a friend-of-the-court statement.
Further lawyers said in a statement that a policy prohibiting immigrants from entering has a negative impact on the U.S. economy, saying that they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and "give important services."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer take refuge for victims who fled domestic violence and crime groups in June.
"The refuge is available to those who flee their country for bullying or fear because of race, religion, nation, or membership in a group of communities or political comments," Sessions said in a June 11 announcement of the policy.
The asylum process was not meant to solve all problems - even all major problems - which people are facing every day around the world.
Most rescue efforts in Palu while the number of disasters doubled in the race for survivors,
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It seems very bad," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her influenza child at a rescue facility in the city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is not readily available."
"The residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, taking wet materials, trying to save anything they can get.
Hundreds of people were injured while hospitals, damaged by an earthquake of <0x37>.5 magnitude, having failed to control the number of patients.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, as they drowned him outside the Palu Army Hospital , where patients were being treated out due to the progression of later tremors.
Tears filled her eyes with reciting how a severe earthquake shook the room in the fifth floor of a hotel where they had his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I was pressed into wall debris, I think, "Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying with help, but then she became silent.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope you're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'terrorism' through 'propaganda ads'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page advertisement in the United States newspaper that illuminated the collective benefits of American and Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. Journalists to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week referred to the addition of China Daily's pay-per-view hiatus to the Des Moines Register <0xE2><0x80><0x93> the most sold newspaper in the State of Iowa <0xE2><0x80><0x93> after accusing China of seeking to intervene in the election of U.S. delegates on November <0x36>, allegations that China has opposed.
Trump's allegations that Beijing was trying to intervene in U.S. elections indicate what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington's fast campaigns to push for China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to keep advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently facing each other in a trade war that has led to an increase in each other's product tribute rate.
China's early marketing insurgency was created to influence exporters from states such as Iowa which supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the chief exporter of China's agricultural products, said Beijing negatively affected U.S. workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in a commentary piece at Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now reduces the bullying by posting propaganda advertisements to free media."
"In the distribution of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a method that has been funded by the United States of freedom of opinion and free information by placing advertisements paid to the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In comparison, on parts of newspapers in the streets in Beijing, you will find very few voices giving opposition and you will not be able to see a different situation and opinions that Chinese people may have in relation to the troubled aims of China's economy, considering that the media is closely controlled by the Communist Party."
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what newspaper he did.
Republican Distinguished Women Voting to Age Age of Representatives With Cavanaugh Crisis, analyst Warn
While many supporters advocated for the electorate in Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual abuse, critics have warned that they will get negative results, especially from women, during the election of representatives.
The emotions surrounding this have been very high and many of the Republicans clearly showed that they wanted to continue with the vote.
These things cannot be reversed,"Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he is worried that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI investigation will be enough to comfort voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday <0xE2><0x80><0x93> they will never forget tomorrow and all November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesman for the MoveOn development group said on Friday, according to the Washington DC.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming!" when they marched in the Senate highway when the Republicans who were holding the Court Committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The influence and motivation of democrats exceeded expectations", "Stu Rothenberg, an independent political critic, told the news website.
"People say it has already reached a high level; that's true.
But it may be higher, particularly among women voters in the suburbs and small voters, aged 1<0x38> to 29, who do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public evidence described sexual abuse against the Supreme Court's electorate, critics said the negative results could follow as of the WajRepublicans will continue and confirm.
"This has been a fantasy game for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of Republicans earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh is appointed, it's also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they treated him ," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps select Democrats, has said at the news centre.
However, Americans seem to have some division as to who is credible after the evidence of Ford and Kavanaugh, with many leaning toward Kavanaugh.
A new study from YouGov shows that 41<0x25> of participants are obvious or perhaps believed Ford's testimony, while 35<0x25> said it was obvious or perhaps believed in Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 3<0x38><0x25> said they thought Kavanaugh explicitly or perhaps lied during his testimony, while only 30<0x25> have said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford along with another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford witnessed before the Senate Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh persecuted him at the age of 1<0x37>.
Ramirez says the Supreme Court's Selector revealed his secrets while they attended a ceremony when they were at school in Yale in the 19<0x38>0s.
World Wide Web Explorer Plans to Introduce New Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, launches a new business that will offer competition against Facebook, Amazon and Google
The latest technician's project, Inrupt, is a company that is created through the platform the Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to select a location where their data will be stored by people who are allowed to access the details.
In an exclusive interview with Fast company, Berners-Lee claimed that Inrupt's intent is to "rule the world."
"We should do it now," he said regarding business.
"It's a historical time."
Programs use Solid technology to allow people to create a "personal data storage online" or POD.
It can include a list of communications, a list of things to do, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Reserve, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on one browser and at a time.
And unique about personal data storage online is that only a user can access what type of description.
The company refers to this as "personal access through data."
The concept of Inrupt, according to company Managing Director John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and accurate knowledge to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Bruce of Berners-Lee, a security platform purchased by IBM, some artists hired to create this project and a volunteer community of code-makers.
Starting this week, technology artists around the world can create their one-part programs using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team have not talked to "Facebook and Google about whether or starting a full change where all of their business models will be combined in one night.
"We don't ask their permission."
"On publication at Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "The Inrupt message is to provide commercial and environmental energy to help protect the integrity and quality of a new network created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the network when he founded the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has contributed more to the debate of having an independent website.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain a Member and Director of the World Wide Web, Web Foundation and Open Data Foundation.
"I have a wonderful hope about this web show," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victoria Cross Award-winning priest during WWW1
The only British Church vicar to win the Victoria Cross award during the First Great War as a fighter has been celebrated in his town 100 years later.
Colonel Lutena Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 191<0x38> in the assault of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a target invader four days later and never discovered that he had won the highest British military award.
A memorial stone is revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it is "a wonderful example" that the stone is actually revealed 100 years from his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 191<0x38>, Colonel Lutena Vann commanded his regiment alongside the Canal de Saint-<0x51>uentin "through heavy fog and heavy shooting from the field and guns."
He later ran on the shooting line and for "greater courage" led the line to advance before using a field gun alone and targeting three weapons.
Colonel Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German target raid on 4 October 191<0x38> - more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, <0x37>2, said his grandfather's actions were "acts that I know I can't reach but it's very interesting."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also installed a flower crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "was feeling very respectful to participate in the parade" and added "the bravery of the real hero is shown with support from many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 20<0x36>, but found Peppa Pig instead,
Consider this, you've waited all night to watch Bellator 20<0x36> but simply refused to watch the main event.
Billy from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and was being flown live all night in the United Kingdom via Channel 5.
At <0x36> a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to get to know each other, the audience in the UK was left open when the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Others were disappointed after remaining alert to early hours especially for combat.
One fan on Twitter described changing and posting children's cartoons as "some kind of horrible joke."
"It's a government principle where when it reached <0x36> a.m. content was not appropriate so it had to change programming to become children's," said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of Bellator's markets and communications, when asked about the launch."
""Peppa the pig, "yes."
Bellator president Scott Coker said that they will go to work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the frequency, I think we can probably take into account this," Coker said.
"But now it's <0x36> a.m. Sunday there and we can't consider this until Sunday our time, Monday when they.
But we took care of it.
I believe, when it changed there was a lot of message being sent and it didn't grow well.
We were trying to fix, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government.
I can promise you that such a thing will not happen in the future.
We're going to put it in five fights instead of six - as we do normal - and we tried to make an effort for fans but failed.
It's an unexpected situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt a 'failure' because of his gender
Olympic divingman Tom Daley says that he felt distraught because of his gender throughout his development - but this gave him an incentive to succeed in life.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't recognize it until he joined the pepper school that "I realized that not everyone like me."
Speaking on Radio 4 at Desert Island Discs prepared by Lauren Laverne, he says that he talked about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope."
He notes that parental action made him less focused on winning at the Olympics.
The long-running producer, Kirsty Young, has been out for a period due to illness.
Participating as a segregated in Laverne's first episode, Daley says that he felt "to have some deficiencies" than everyone of his age because it was "not accepted chimpanzee to love girls and boys."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of self-interest and some deficiencies, and feeling different from others are things that have given me the strength and ability to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he could not discourage anyone in the long run when they discover his gender.
A two-time bronze medalist he claims to Olympics has been a prominent member in LGBT support campaigns and was used to take part in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries not to consider the issue of same-sex sexuality as a crime.
He said he came up because he felt lucky to be able to live without effect and wanted to give others "hope."
This three-time world champion said love with another man - American filmmaker - Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "you found him unexpectedly."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is old to invite him for 20 years, last year but said that the age gap has never been a major issue.
"When you go through a lot of things at a very young age" <0xE2><0x80><0x93> he went to the first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later <0xE2><0x80><0x93> he said that it was hard to find someone of the same age who had gone through such things.
The couple became parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all attitude" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I just thought 'I need to win the gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
"Sony has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not agree that he would die and one of the last things he asked was whether they have yet got their London 2012 Olympic tickets - because he wanted to be a front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you can't go close to the hiatus range'," he said.
"I had caught his hand when he stopped breathing and had to stop breathing completely and die is what I believed he had failed," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was the one that I had lost all my life - diving in front of our crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also urged her choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had given her a boost during the preparation of the Olympics and made her excited.
Desert Island Discs season is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST
Mickelson who has been poorly played is placed on the bench in the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 4<0x37>th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his game so that he won't reach the pick without cheering.
Mickelson, playing in the doubles event a year and setting a 12th-round playoff record, was placed on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for four balls and a pair game.
Instead of being in the depth of the event, how often he was to the United States, the winner of the main shell five times divided his day between being a fan and rehearsing the game in hopes of fixing his problem.
Never is a leader even at the top of his career, the 4<0x38>-year-old player is not the right choice for a game in Le Golf National, which bad ball is occasionally penalized.
And if the field is not enough reason, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, confronts British champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with new player Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points back as they start a 12-man match, have a strong opposition, Mickelson's match can prove to be absolutely important.
Furyk showed courage in his man, not that he could say more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, encouraged and embraced and reassured me that he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He is very brave in his ability.
He is a celebrity and has contributed greatly to these teams in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't see him playing two matches.
I expected him to play more, but that's what happened and that's the way we thought we should consider.
He wants to be out playing, just like anybody else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most matches in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It can be his final in playing the Ryder Cup that has never resembled the quality of his personal record.
Mickelson has 1<0x38> wins, 20 losses and seven uniforms, although Furyk said his presence brought some benefits to the team.
"He's a clown, brave, he likes to tease people and he's a good person to have him in the team," he explained.
"I think that shooting players were also happy to fight him too this week, which was interesting to see.
He has more contribution than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the leadership of multiple tracks can be lost recently
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a great lead entering the final days of the Ryder Cup can turn into a nervous journey.
Mdende played his first match in 199<0x37> at Valderrama, where the team led by Severe Ballesteros led with five points against the Americans but finished as the game advanced, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You continue to remind us that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but very closely," said Bjorn, having been filmed, having watched the 201<0x38> Class win 5<0xE2><0x80><0x93>3 Friday and yesterday and led 10<0xE2><0x80><0x93><0x36> at Le Golf Na.
So history implies to me and everyone on the team that the game is not yet over.
You're going to be the brightest there tomorrow.
Go there and make sure you have done things how they should.
This game hasn't finished until you get a score.
We have a goal and it's trying to win this shell and that's what we aim for.
I've said this all the time, I consider 12 players who are on our team, but we know well the team's best opponents - the best players in the world.
"Intrigued by how his players did in a hard field, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't have any more hope than this in this.
Tomorrow is a very different day.
Tomorrow is a personal activity you will decide and that's a different thing.
It's good to be out there with a partner when things are interesting, but when you're out there alone, then you've been fully tested for all your abilities as a golfer.
That's the message you need to tell players, it's to act on your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner to go and act better with him, too.
"In contrast to Bjorn, opposing team captain Jim Furyk will send his players to do better as personal best when they played as allies, except Jordan and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was involved in the prestigious games on the last day, having become part of the winning team at Brookline before finishing in defeat when Europe found "The Miracle of Medina."
"I remember every word," he said when he was knocked out about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, brought his players together to the final.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get a good start as it was at Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When the speed goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the intermediate matches.
We organized our players efficiently and put people in a way that we felt preferred, you know, we're trying to do the miracle tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in a high-profile match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter others in the European team in the top half of the list.
"I went with this team in this order because I think it reflects the whole trip," said Bjorn for his choice of players in a personal game.
The new German warship is recaptured
The newest German Navy ships were scheduled to be launched in 2014 to replace veteran ships used in the Cold War, but it will not be until at least next year due to poor systems and increased costs, the press reported.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship between the new Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit magazine quoted a military spokesman.
This ship was joining the Navy in 2014, but issues of later delivery affected the fate of this large project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships that the Navy ordered in 200<0x37> are coming to replace the Bremen warships.
It is known that it will include a power cancer, aerodynamic range and decorative missiles and also secret technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important components include organizations over time - it is possible to send the new ships for two years away from home.
However, ongoing delay means that the high-level warships - said to allow Germany to target abroad - will already be obsolete when they begin to serve, explained Die Zeit.
The F125 gained popularity last year, when the German Navy refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned ships to shipbuilders after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for reconnaissance, but the German press referred to several reasons for "essential software defects and hulls" that made the ship inadequate if they were taken to war.
The shortage in the program was important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ship will be operated by 120 crews - just half of the crew on the old Bremen ships.
It also happened that the ship has an extra weight something orbing reduces its operation and limits the Navy's ability to improve it in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" of <0x37>,000 tons is believed to have double weight compared to similar ships used by the Germans in the Second Great War.
In addition to faulty hues, the cost of the entire project <0xE2><0x80><0x93> including staff training <0xE2><0x80><0x93> is also a major issue.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion yuro (<0x24>3.<0x36> billion) - from the initial cost of 2.2 billion yuro.
The problems facing the new ship become especially of importance due to warning that the German naval power has dropped.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the Navy "may actually miss ships capable of being sent to war."
The official said that the issue had long been ignored, because the old ships were removed but no alternative ships were issued.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships would be used by the Navy.
The National Trust saves the secret life of bats
A new field research in the Uscotian Mountains is aimed at describing how bats use the environment in hunting their foods.
You expect these results will give a new description of the behavior of these unique flying animals and help guide future conservation operations.
A study of scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will follow bats of piistrelles and sopranos as well as long ears bats and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed in important areas near the area to pursue bat operations throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct telecentre investigations using hand recognition.
Sound analysis for all records expertise will confirm the frequency of bat sounds and the species doing so.
An environmental map and reports will be presented to create a detailed environment—a graphical design for their behaviors.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant at NTS, expects the results to show which environment areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species of bats.
These descriptions will help determine the benefits of environmental management work such as pasture formation and the best ways to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The numbers of bats in both the Scots and England have declined significantly over the last century.
They get a threat from construction and development work that affects nesting and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lights can also be hazardous, as well as insecticide devices and some chemical products of building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Population is not particularly blind.
However, due to their night hunting habits their ears are more important than their eyes reaching is the point of catching prey.
They use a complex field echo technique to target insects and barriers in their pathway.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 2<0x37>0 historic buildings, 3<0x38> critical parks of <0x37><0x36>,000 hectares of land across the country, is focused on bats.
It has provided training to ten trained professionals, who occasionally perform surveys, nest inspections and sometimes save bats.
The organisation has even established the first and unique Uscoti bat reserve on Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten bat species in Uscoti.
Property manager David Thompson has said the property is an excellent location for the batsman.
"Here in the Threave we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good surroundings.
But there's a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and in other resources will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.
"He emphasizes the importance of looking at the presence of bats before making organizations within the property because it is possible for unconscious damage can kill to bat bats and 400 young bats, and probably destroy the entire number of bats in the area.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer at the Popo Conservation Agency, has urged the public to intervene and help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats because most of our species don't know how many of us have survived."
Ronaldo denied allegations of rape while lawyers planned to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has said the allegations of rape against him are "false news," saying that people "want to declare themselves" under his name.
His lawyers have planned to appeal to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been charged with rape of an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid <0x24>3<0x37>5,000 to be quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking on Instagram's Direct Video to 142 million followers a few hours after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, rebuked the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
They said today, false stories, "Five Ballon d'Or winner says on camera."
"They want to declare themselves under my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for naming my name, but it's part of work.
I'm happy and I'm okay," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the allegations, which they said are "unacceptable statements of suspicion in the private area," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek the execution of "moral damage in accordance with the weight of violations, which may be one of the greatest violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event is said to have been held in June 2009 in a chimney at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported to return to the player's room, where he allegedly raped him backwards, according to documents submitted to Clark County Court of Appeals in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo kneeled after the incident and told him that with "99<0x25>" he is a "good man" who was dropped by "one percent."
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that she had sex, but it was voluntary.
Mayorga also says that he went to report to the police and was photographed of his injuries in the hospital, but later accepted out-of-court compensation because he felt "a fear of retaliation" and was concerned about "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now ready to pay compensation because she continues to suffer a hypothesis with the incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the allegations, and this season moved to Italian champions Juve when he was bought for <0xC2><0xA3>100 million.
Brexit: England 'will regret forever' for losing automakers
Britain will 'forever regret' for losing its position as world leader in automobile manufacturing after Brexit, Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without a contract it could suspend production time at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," said Mr Clark.
Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of delays in the border if there is no contract after Brexit will lead to the loss of employment.
Burnaston Factory - which manufactures Auris Toyota and Avensis - produced around 150,000 cars last year where 90<0x25> were exported to the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves outside the European Union in March we will see a step to stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have expressed fears of leaving the European Union without agreement on how the border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main issues are related to what manufacturers say are risks of distribution in the event that there is no agreement after Brexit.
Toyota's production is implemented on the basis of "time-efficient", with equipment reaching every 3<0x37> minutes from salesmen in the UK and the European Union for ordered vehicles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, there may be problems in the border where the sector says it can cause delays and scarcity of equipment.
It is impossible for Toyota to wait more a day at his Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's Checkers' plan for future relations with the European Union is "provided to avoid the investigation at the border."
"We need to have a plan. We want to have a better deal that will allow not only the success at the moment but also take the present opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today show.
"The witness from not only Toyota but other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to keep getting the distribution that has been successful ahead."
Toyota could not say the suspension of production, but for a long time, it warned that additional costs would reduce factory competition and eventually loss of employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite in the factory, said his allies are becoming increasingly concerned: "In my experience once these jobs leave never return.
A spokesperson for the government said: "We have set a proper and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump and Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-profile summit and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "another weekly postponed" with a confrontation with high court-elect Brett Kavanaugh continuing, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser David Mueller, who investigates the intervention of elections with Russia, the relationship between Trump's and Russia's deputies and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
If or of Trump seeks a job as deputy attorney general and thus threaten Mueller's independence, it has sparked Washington's rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, while it is said he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at a United Nations rally in New York, was announced to take place on Thursday.
Trump said he "ang preferred" not to fire Rosenstein but a meeting was delayed to avoid a collision and a trial in the Senate Court Committee which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, all witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, resulting in a delay in the Senate's full vote.
Trump's news secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "The date for that is not set, it may be this week, I can see it causing it to be pushed back for another week considering what it is in the supreme court.
But we will see what will have to inform the media.
"Other writers could protest: Sanders has not hosted a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Local Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarcity of information is not due to the lack of preference for television journalists to "interest attention," though he said: "I don't want to disagree with the fact that they attract attention."
He then said that direct communication between Trump and journalists will increase.
"The President makes <0x51>uestions and Answers sessions more than any previous president," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "We have looked at those figures."
"The press release will continue, Sanders said, but "if the media has the chance to ask him direct questions to the president of the United States, that's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it many times and you've seen us do it more in the past few weeks and that this will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
"Trump responds regularly to questions when leaving the White House or when participating in open sessions or meetings with foreign leaders.
Meetings and media alone are rare.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, by giving a speech unorganized and sometimes appearing in front of gathered journalists.
Health Minister writes to European Union workers in the Scottish Health Organization about Brexit's fears
The Minister of Health has written to European Union workers working in the Health Organization Uscoti thanks for the country and to expect them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter while praying six months until Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Uscoti government has volunteered to reach the cost of residential applications for European Union citizens working in its public services.
In his letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer, talks between the United Kingdom and the European Union about withdrawal have continued, toward the decisions expected this autumn season.
But the British Government also improves its preparation for the impossible state of solutions.
I know this is a very unhappy time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to mention how I appreciate each worker's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues from all over the European Union and more, they bring important experiences and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work, and help patients with the community we serve.
Uscot is your home completely and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie Emergency Surgery After Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a game they defeated 31<0xE2><0x80><0x93>2<0x37> on Saturday against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that an injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the edge and just fainted," Reed said.
The staff and therapists gave Abercrombie oxygen to the banks before putting him on the cheese for further review.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV show in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no explanation about the type/pain rate yet" and Tennessee State is trying to identify when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first-class, accolade in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which added a total of tackles in the season to 1<0x38>.
Foreign buyers will be abbreviated high stamp tributes if they buy in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be abbreviated high stamp tributes buying property in the UK with additional funds being used to help homeless people under new Tory plan
The hiatus move aims to balance Corbyn's successful move to attract young voters
The increase in stamp tributes will be abbreviated to those who do not pay UK tributes
The Ministry of Finance expects to get up to <0x24>120 million annually - to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be abbreviated high stamp tributes if they buy property in the UK <0xE2><0x80><0x93> and additional funds will be used to help homeless, Theresa May has announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to balance the success that Jeremy Corbyn has gained to attract young voters with a promise to offer affordable housing and targeting high income owners.
The increase in stamp tributes will be imposed on individuals and businesses that do not pay their tributes in the UK, with additional funds being used to improve the government's plan to combat residential status for homeless people.
These additional payments <0xE2><0x80><0x93> which include current stamp tributes, including high rates placed two years ago in second houses and rental homes <0xE2><0x80><0x93> may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the hiatus will give it up to <0x24>120 million annually.
Approximately 13<0x25> of new buildings in London are bought by non-English residents, causing an increase in price making it difficult for the first buyers to buy their first home.
Many rich parts of the country <0xE2><0x80><0x93> especially in the capital <0xE2><0x80><0x93> have been "spirited towns" because of a large number of foreign buyers spending more time abroad.
A new policy comes a week after Boris Johnson asked for a discount in stamp tribute to help younger people buy their first home.
He denounced large construction firms for investing in high property prices by purchasing land and failing to build them and asking Mrs. May to withdraw from rental to repair "a disgrace in the UK housing sector".
Mr. Corbyn has announced an interesting series in residential evolution, including tax control to threaten the dismissal situation "without fault".
He also wants to give councillors more power to build a new house.
Ms. May said: "Year yesterday I wanted to volunteer to revive Britain's dream <0xE2><0x80><0x93> that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means changing our ruined residential sector.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and start a new life.
However, it cannot be fair to be easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy houses at the same price as UK hardworking residents.
For so many people the dream of ownership of the house has been too far away and there is a great deal of likelihood of homelessness."
Jack Ross: 'Cause of my determination is to become a boss of Uscoti'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "family" is to become Uscoti's manager at some point.'
This Scotlandman, 42, enjoys the challenge of revitalizing the North-east club, now in third place in the First League, three points from above.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this season after helping St Mirren return to the Scottish League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was able to get a national game of the B team and reached there, "Ross told the BBC Sportsound show Uskoti.
"But I grew up watching Scots in Hampden with my father as a child and I have always been impressed with that thing.
However, the opportunity will only come, if I succeed in the management of the club."
"Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he had no fear of following such popular names in such a big club, having rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My achievements at this time will be measured by 'je, can I restore this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and equipment in this club, it should certainly be in the English Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy job to return, but I'd just like to see myself as successful here if I'd be able to get the club back there up."
"Ross has only three years since he started a managerial career, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as an apprentice at the Hearts club.
He then helped Alloa from being lowered to third and switched St Mirren from being lowered to winning the League cup the following season.
And Ross says he feels much better than he was at the time playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Another was the real way," he recalled, of taking over Alloa.
"I certainly believed management was right for me, more than playing.
It seems strange because I did the same, I got the income from playing and enjoying the highest level conditions.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things you should do every week.
I'm still going through it in the issue of stress and pressure of work but I feel management is the same.
I always wanted to be an administrator and now I'm doing it, I feel better in me throughout my adult life."

The best time for getting alcohol is 11.30 p.m. Saturday, a study has discovered
The summer heat has increased drinking in British struggling bars but has increased pressure on restaurants.
Bates received an increase of 2.<0x37><0x25> in July - but drinking in restaurants declined to 4.<0x38><0x25>, data showed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's commercial adviser, which included the figures, said: "The continued solar and more time-consuming participation of England in the World Cup means July followed the same model as last month of June, when bars received an increase of 2.<0x38><0x25>, except that restaurants had even more impact.
A 1.<0x38><0x25> discount in the restaurant business in June was further damaged in July.
The beverage bars did better with restaurants with discounts.
Food bars suffered a warm season, although not like restaurant operators.
It seems people just want to go out and get alcohol.
Controlled bars received an increase in sales of <0x36>.<0x36><0x25> that month and food decreases by three percent."
"Paul Newman, entertainment critic and generosity at RSM said: "This effect continues in the direction we have seen since the end of April.
Climate and the impact of major social events or games is still the largest factors that affect sales in the domestic market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.<0x38><0x25> per year will greatly hurt considering ongoing cost pressures.
The long-term summer has come at the worst time for food service providers and it'll have to wait if the average temperature we got August will change things to good."
"The general growth of sales in bars and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.<0x37><0x25> in July, compared to the decline in brand products.
Tracking sales in the Coffer Peach Tracker sector for bars and restaurants collects and analyzes operational data from 4<0x37> functional groups, with a combined sales total of over <0x24>9 billion and is an important model in the sector.
One out of five children has secret social media accounts that become encrypted from their parents
One out of five children - another even 11-year-old - they have confidential social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers, research exposes
A study for 20,000 high school students has shown growth in the pages "Insta artificial"
The statement has caused fears that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of the students said they own a "high" account to show parents
One out of five children - another even 11-year-old - creates false social media accounts that keep secret from adults.
A study for 20,000 high school students has shown a rapid growth in the account "Instant" - references to the Instagram sharing website.
The news has added fears that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they create a "high" account to show parents, while they also own other privacy.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's website found a young man urging others to "buy me."
The Digital Apartment UK study and the UK Association of Great English Teachers of independent schools (HMC), found 40<0x25> of children aged 11 to 1<0x38> had two and half accounts agreed to keep accounts privately.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's concerned that many young people are being tried in creating online sites that parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scots Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Uscoti Athletes as an undisputed director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is the most prized Scottish athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the game to benefit from his extensive experience at the international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Uscoti community, England and the world's athletic community and we are confident athletics in the Uscoti will benefit greatly by engaging him on the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am willing to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the game in the Scots."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 199<0x36> Olympic Games in Atlanta between the total of his four Olympic golds and is now an analyst at the BBC, failed to walk after finding a lack of blood flow.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago today I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said it will only be known over time if I can heal and on what level it is.
It's been hard to heal full, to learn again how to walk and today to make a return to the movement!
Thank you for the comfort message!"
An announcement of breast pump Comparison of mother and cow creates differing views online
The breast pump company has distributed feedback online using an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers and bulls.
In order to mark the launch of what is known as "the world's quietest breast pump," a user technology company Elvie released a funny music video advertisement to show the freedom the new pump provides breastfeeding mothers.
The four real mothers play the nurses in a barn filled with cattle food with a song consisting of words such as: "Well, I struggle, but you don't see the tail" and "If you haven't noticed these are the hairs are my breasts."
The song continues: "Search out, dictionary out, I feed kids, dictionary out, dictionary out, and pick up my women."
However, an advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With <0x37><0x37>,000 viewing times and hundreds of views, the video has received different viewers and many say it reflects the milk sector's "terrorist fears".
"A very bad decision using cattle to advertise this product.
If we need to get pregnant and reproduce to produce milk, unless their children are removed immediately after birth, "one wrote.
The Elvie breast pump enters very well into the breast syrup (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: "It bothers the mother and the child in thought.
But yes why don't you use it to advertise breast pump for mothers who are still with their children?"
Another person added: "Anonymous announcement."
Others defended the announcement and one woman agreed that she felt the song was "laughter."
I think this is a very strict idea.
I'd get one if I'd still breastfeed.
Dropping made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is stupid but I understand it.
This is a high-profile creative product," one wrote.
Another person said: "This is a fun advertisement that aims to have a mother who sucks milk (often in a workplace or a toilet) and feels like "a cow."
"This is not a declaration of praise or denial of the milk sector."
At the end of the video a group of women shows that they have all been playing with pumps on their cylinders.
The idea of a campaign comes from knowledge that many women who use pumps say they feel like cattle.
The Elvie pump however, is quite silent, has no wires or tributaries and fits completely inside a breastfeeding wait and gives women freedom by moving, holding their children and even going out while milking them.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD teacher at Mother said: "The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that deserved the launch of courage and motivation.
Given the spread between describing women and dairy cattle we wanted to keep the deed of breast pumping and all its challenges in the care, with a fun and interesting way of the sense of freedom the new pump brings.
This is not the first time Elvie pump has hit headlines.
During the Style Week in London, a mother of two children walked on stage to architect Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrants Moved to Tent Camp in Texas Border
The number of children detentioned immigrants has increased even though the number of passersby has not changed, because the politics and policies given by the Trump administration have made it difficult to keep children to donors.
Usually, many donors have been unregistered immigrants and are afraid to risk their ability to pray in the country by promoting child demand.
Risk increased in June, when the country's authority announced that possible donors and other house adults would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared by immigration authority.
Last week, Mathew Albence, the senior Immigration and Customs enforcement officer, testified before Congress that the organization had arrested several people who had requested to fund children alone.
The agency later confirmed that <0x37>0<0x25> of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"About <0x38>0<0x25> of people who are donors or family allies are here in the country illegally and most of them are criminal visitors.
. Thus we keep track of those people, "Mr. Albence said.
In the faster process, leaders introduced new laws that will require some of them to be submitted to the court within a month after being arrested, rather than <0x36>0 days, which was customary in advance, according to residential workers.
Many will be submitted via a meeting telephone via video, rather than a person's presence, to apply for their case to a legal condition for an immigration judge.
Those who will be considered dissatisfied with help will be quickly returned to their country.
The way the child remains in custody for a long time is the more likely to have panic and anxiety or discouragement, which may lead to violent feelings or attempts to escape, according to charcoal workers and reports that have emerged from the system several months ago.
Lawyers said these issues are increasing in large centres such as Tornillo, where a sign that the child has bad conditions is ignored, due to his size.
They added that evacuating children to the tent city without giving enough time to provide them emotionally or interacting with friends the last time it can add to it that many are already going through.
Syria tells US 'militia called', France and Turkey to leave immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, though it has now reached eight years of war in the country.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are in Syria illegally, under the pretext of counterterrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They should leave immediately and unconditionally," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism was about to be completed" in Syria, where over 3<0x36>0,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy war until we save all Syria" from all terrorist groups and "any foreign presence."
"The United Nations has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and counseling Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in a multi-war country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said conditions were good for them to return and blamed the "western lands" for "increasing false fear" which has caused refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and human organizations to facilitate the steps to return," he said.
"They put politics in the human issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no construction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a bait zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish alliance has blocked the attacks of Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem however maintained that the agreement had a "open time" and expressed the hope that the military action will help militants including fighters from Nusra Front associated with Al-<0x51>aeda, who will "be finished."
UN delegate Staffan de Mistura expects to host the first meetings of a new committee that includes members of the state and opposition to provide the post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the electoral route.
Moualem laid the terms of Syria's government's involvement in the committee, saying the panel's work should be controlled "to investigate the passages of the current constitution," and warned against intervention.
Why Trump Is Responsible Again to Election for a Second Age
by that logic, Mr. Trump will again win the 2020 election unless viewers like progress and many changes hope that, the removal of power abuse and scandals will soon end his presidency.
And to be of course "the greatest end of the presidency ever!"
Currently, there are no symptoms of the observer's fatigue.
Since 2014, certification has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly three to 1.<0x36> million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers, an increase from 1.<0x37> million years ago, according to Nielsen and the MSNBC episode "The Rachel Maddow Show" leads in screenings of cable television to 3.5 million viewers on the main night of the news.
"These are things that attract people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC drama show "Designed Survivor," about the minister who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the executive offices of the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, former comic writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalls a taxi trip in Boston prior to the 201<0x36> election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? Asked.
"He said," Because he always makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is a value of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, a story from Washington can later decide Roe v. v. Wade's case, if immigrant families can reunite with the health of the world economy.
Appearances are only luxury for viewers with many opportunities they can afford to dump him.
However, the issue exceeds a conscious citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour of viewing a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "long play" in the sources of his book "Fear," a <0xC2><0xA3>15,000 jacket of Paul Manafort's designer's skin ("a heavy coat of whistleblowing, "Washington's punch" in the sources of his book.
I, never, will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
"The part of what he does and makes it look like the show doesn't guess is that he gives you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the architect of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's period to change characters and scenes every day (starting confrontations in the NFL on the wing).
You don't want to miss one show or stop tracking.

He could not leave there, not as Brett Kavanaugh approached to appear before the Senate Court Committee and the fate of the Supreme Court if it is not known.
"I remember when we were doing all these amazing sessions in the past and people were saying," This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,"" Mr. Fleiss told me.

Foreign funds overflow within the closest elections of Parliamentary representatives
It is not surprising that 1<0x37> Pennsylvania districts have experienced financial flooding, due to relocation of congressional districts that found two current leaders fighting for the same seat.
The district that gained the new boundaries of Pittsburg has Representative Democratic Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in the last special election of the spring season.
Lamb is running for someone else's nomination, Republican Keith Rothfus, a current leader representing Pennsylvania's 12th-century former district, which is prevalent with 1<0x37> new ones.
The maps were reprinted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been drawn to suit the Republicans.
The innovation in the new 1<0x37>s has established financial competitions in funding groups of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was a popular name in Pennsylvania after a minor victory in a special election closely followed March in the 1<0x38>th Pennsylvania Legislative District.
The seat had been held by Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts say Democrats have a little better chance of winning.
U.S. Imagined Punishment of El Salvado in Support of China, Then Stopped
Diplomatics said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and little pressure to not do so from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a good meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 201<0x37> and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the allies hid a Trump Foundation management team.
Officials in the State Department decided to remove the U.S. chief diplomatic messages from El Salvado, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with "the recent decisions of recognising Taiwan," a spokesman for the department, Heather Nauert, said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only focused on El Salvado, which earned <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 201<0x37>, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included the reduction of financial aid and the restrictions on visa applications, would have a significant impact on the Central United States and unemployment and high rates of murder.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American leaders proposed a high-profile conference on safety and economic well-being and followed a similar meeting last year that was seen as a forward move in an effort to prevent immigrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top administrative leaders made it clear that they wanted the summit to go ahead and effectively stop any penalties violations for El Salvado.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the meeting, scheduled to take place in mid October, with a sign of the importance the administration has put in the convention, diplomats said.
And three U.S. diplomats returned anonymously in El Salvado, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a new sharp message or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton refused to provide information on the discussion details made by three U.S. leaders, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions without revealing identity.
Their views were confirmed by an external critic near the regime and he also discussed without exposing identity.
A Study of History
The next fall can be a report by special attorney Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump's possibility of obstructing justice, where there is now much evidence in the public.
Mr. Mueller also directs his investigation if Mr. Trump's campaign partnered with Russia in attacking our elections.
If Congress changes control, Mr. Trump will find himself faced with accountability cases in the legislature, just as he is preparing to go back to petition for voters and perhaps eventually judges of his co-partisan allies.
These are many things that are now just saying it is possible and I don't say that Mr. Trump's removal of power is inevitable - nor for leaders like him in Europe.
There are options that must be made by every side of the Atlantic that will affect how long the struggle is going on.
In 193<0x38>, German officials were willing to undertake a coup against Hitler, only if Western nations refused to support and support the Czechslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of subsequent murder.
The trend of history revolves around similar changes and the stability of the course of democracy is speeded up or delayed.
The Americans are facing a number of changes at the moment.
How will we do if Mr. Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person who controls Mr. Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein has been in critical condition since the newspaper reported that last year, he proposed secretly recording the president and saying he is not negligent to be a detective.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' memory is incorrect.
"What will we be able to answer if a new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh will not be complete and fair <0xE2><0x80><0x93> or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, we'll vote in the election of House representatives who will not be able to make Mr. Trump not to regard righteousness?
If we fail these measurements, democracy will face the risk of long-term decline.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz by the Nazi government which at one time was using my diplomatic home.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, <0x36>0 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika sign.
With that as my legacy, how can I miss a good view of our future life?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers hopes ahead of the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are host to Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the win against the Austrians, after a good uniform in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good qualifying position from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from playing his first match this season to a 2<0xE2><0x80><0x93>2 uniform against Villarreal but believes Rangers could use the result to start a lot.
"It was a good score for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We went into the game believing we could find something and we came back with one score.
Maybe we could get more at the end but, in general, the uniform was probably the same result.
They were probably the best in the first half and we went in the second half better.
Entering Thursday, it's another big night in Europe.
Hopefully, we can get all three points but you'll be a hard game because they got good results in their last game but, along with our fans behind us, I'm sure we can push and get a good result.
Last year it was very hard, between everything that happened to my victims and the change in the club but there's a good feeling about this place now.
The squad is the same as the players are very happy; your exercises are the same.
We expect, we can push now, forget the previous season and succeed."
Women lack sleep due to fears of savings for retirement
Although the fact that research participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, a few people were talking to their families about this.
Approximately half of people in a nationwide study said they were talking to their lovers about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10<0x25> said they spoke to their children about it.
"People want family members to care for them, but they don't take steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide insurance industry.
This is how one begins.
Talking to your lover and children: You can't provide your family with services if you don't make your wishes well known before time.
Connect with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive services, because those options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Share your financial adviser: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay the expenses.
Your philanthropic choices for long-term care may include a long-term insurance policy, a streamline life insurance policy of the money value money to handle these costs or autonomy for your wealth <0xE2><0x80><0x93> the best you have money.
Use your legal documents: Get your legal cases early.
Find a medical service representative document so that you can select someone you believe to manage your medical service and make sure professionals obey your requirements if you are unable to communicate.
Also, take a lawyer's contribution to your money.
You should choose someone you believe to make financial decisions for you and assure your expenses are paid in time.
Don't forget the details: consider that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
You have the ability to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Put the comments in a written plan so that you can be ready.
"Not just money is involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 3<0x38>4 people have been killed by a massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, the leaders said and the number of disasters is expected to rise.
With communications interrupted, aid officers have not been able to obtain any information from Donggala's administration, the northern Palu area that is near the <0x37>.5 magnitude earthquake disaster.
In Palu, over 1<0x36>,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Region, located at the end of a narrow crater on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 3<0x37>9,<0x38>00 in 201<0x37>.
The city was commemorating the 40th anniversary of the tsunami outbreak.
Donggala is a rule of over 300 kilometres (1<0x38>0 mi) northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The short-term government, the administrative area under the county, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 201<0x37>.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The mining of nickel is also important in the region, but is mainly found in Morowali, cascades and the coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunami several times over the course of 100 years, according to the Indonesian Reduction Agency.
In 193<0x38>, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit western Donggala in 199<0x36>, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Fire Pete and is occasionally hit by an earthquake.
Here are some major earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 2<0x36> December caused a tsunami hit 14 countries, killing 22<0x36>,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of the dead came from Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquake hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
200<0x36>: A <0x36>.<0x38> magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, an island of many residents in Indonesia and caused a tsunami that broke the southern coast, killing around <0x37>00 people.
2009: A <0x37>.<0x36> magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A <0x37>.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, away from Sumatra and caused a 10-meter tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed around 300 people.
201<0x36>: A small earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's regime in Aceh and caused destruction and fear while people recall the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused at this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsed buildings.
201<0x38>: A major earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and killed over 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded for a while.
Chief Sarah Palin's son Arrested on Domestic Abuse Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, preventing a report of domestic violence and refusing to be arrested, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, while a girlfriend tried to call the police to report a crime allegation, he took his phone.
Palin is being detained at the Mat-Su Pre Case Center and on a <0x24>500 security bailout, reported KTUU.
He arrived at the Court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, certainly" when asked for his request, the network reported.

Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 3<0x38>4 people have died after an earthquake occurred in the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A <0x37>.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication networks were discontinued and the death toll is expected to rise in the future.
An earthquake occurred just outside central Sulawesi which lies northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos revolve around social media showing the time of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a coastal concert in the town of Palu while the tsunami hit the coast.
Country prosecutors seek punishment for rare death suspect of terror attacks in New York City
New York state prosecutors seek the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist attacks suspect in New York City that killed eight people - rare penalties that have not been executed in the state for the crimes of the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental car to perform an attack on a bicycle route along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov "for purposes" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to a statement of intent to seek the death penalty, issued in the Southern District of New York.
All of these offences carry the possibility of a death sentence, according to a court document.
Weeks after the attack, a panel of federal judges issued a 22-minute lawsuit to Saipov which included eight murder charges with the help of fraud, usually used by country prosecutors in criminal cases organized by violent charges and traffic damages.
Attacks needed to "plann and be well prepared," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's actions that he acted as "disgusting, cruel and misleading."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and losses to Diego family and friends Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian ni Pamian".
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York implemented charges of death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was implemented in the New York state case was in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were punished for death after being found guilty of plotting a fantasy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by death by being placed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed a lack of remorse days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attacks after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has denied 22 criminal charges.
David Patton, one of the country's public advocates representing Saipov, said that they are "broken" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept guilty pleas for life in prison without the possibility of release will only increase it from such incidents to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's representative team originally asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be set to oversee Brexit talks
Nigel Farage swore to 'inspiring the people' army today during a protest at the Tory meeting.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should 'feel heat' from anti-European citizens - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be the head of talks with the European Union.
Conservative party MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain 'should have been out' for now if Mr Farage would be Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces is the challenge of bringing together his mostly divided side of it when Tory supporters who support Remain joined different protests against Brexit in the town.
The prime minister strives to implement his Checkers consensus plan while facing criticism from supporters of Brexit, who support Kusal and the European Union.
His allies insisted that he would continue ahead with the move to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the objections—and forced anti-European and the Leba Party to choose between his plan and the 'possibility'.
Mr Bone told a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to 'stop the Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a partner and was given the responsibility of negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he had control, we'd be ready out now,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit but we need to forget the Checkers deal.'
Showing his opposition to the European Union, he said: 'We didn't fight in the world war let's fall under others.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone denied proposals that public opinion had changed since the 201<0x36> vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their ideas and want to remain totally untrue.'
'Tory MP who supports Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in protest and told reporters: 'I just say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
'The Checkers plan is not very popular with the general public, Opposition cannot vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who actually go in the streets and help us be elected.
Please leave the Checkers plan and start listening to people.'
In a message directed to Mrs. May, he added: 'The Chief Ministers preserve their positions when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage told the meeting that politicians should be made 'to feel warm' if they are about to betray a decision made in the 201<0x36> referendum.
'This is about the issue of loyalty between us - people - and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today telling them 'we can't let him do it.'
In a message to the excited crowd he added: 'I want you to do our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, feel warm.
'We encourage the army of this country that will give us victory in Brexit and which will never rest until we are free, rely on ourselves, be proud Britain.'
At the same time, supporters continued to march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Many activists showed posters written Tories against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Leba MP Mr. Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the safety problems they found in the party program when the meeting opened.
'They're the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technologies of the Anglo-European Plan and the European Union respect the laws of another, by a boundary without problems, for free trade without limitations in Ayaland,' added.
'It's an empty lie.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'loose deep' the intention of running for the presidency,
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she plans "to look deeper at the intention of running for the presidency" after the November election.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats talked about his fate during a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a recurring critic of President Donald Trump, offers re-election in November against GOP Representative Geoff Diehl, who was chairman of the 201<0x36> Trump Campaign partnership in Massachusetts.
He has been in the midst of speculation that he can cope with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 3<0x36>th meeting with voters using the town hall structure since Trump was elected.
The attendee asked if he planned to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it is when "for women to go to Washington to revise our broken government, and that involves a woman in the upper seat."
Man is arrested in connection with the shooting of the Sims of LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that one suspect has been arrested in connection with death for the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 5 a.m. ET at a meeting with reporters.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify someone who appeared in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound on the head and eventually died of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, according to 24<0x37>sports.
Wayde intervened to protect the sniper when he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interviewed and admitted to being in the area of the incident, possession of weapons and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A <0x36> feet long player with <0x36> innings raised in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games and started in 10 games in the previous season with an average of 1<0x37>.4 minutes, 5.<0x36> points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes to winning the world cup after team orders him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear since Valtteri Bottas retired before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that Mercedes' team instructions would play a major role in the race.
From the start, Bottas got a good start and almost completely left Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel took the lead first and left Hamilton to follow a tramp on the team's tail, something that was supposed to contribute significantly.
Mercedes made one round to be behind Vettel, but Hamilton passed ahead after a fierce race that made the Ferrari driver leave the free zone from the impact of being tied after doing so twice in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back-to-back and was in seventh place by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for most of the race and held and then scored Kimi Raikkonen and became fourth.
He eventually reached his relegation zone in the 14th round and failed to speed up the remaining eight circuits while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a wonderful job as a whole checker and showed maturity to let me pass.
The team has done a unique job to take the first and second place," said Hamilton.
This was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting in connection with his insistence that he did not disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court selector Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Court Committee, instead stated that what is going on in the Senate indicated that people were "hard, bad and lying."
"One thing that can happen with a good thing that has been going on a few days ago in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and angry and bad and lying," he said.
"When you look at the offerings and the revealing and then say" oh, I didn't. I didn't.
I didn't do that."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal?
You remember his answer... did you uncover the script - "oh, oh, what?
Ah no!
I didn't expose it.
"Well, wait a minute.
Were we exposed ... No, we didn't reveal, "he added, by imitating the senator.
Feinstein was used a letter describing charges against Kavanaugh and Ford in July and was exposed in early September - but Feinstein denied that it came from his office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Dr Ford. I didn't hide his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it in secret as he asked."
But his revelations did not appear to be well received by the president, who commented during a Saturday night meeting: "I'll tell you this, that was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's appointee, who has been charged with sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their benefit.
"They have decided to take power in any way.
You see fatigue, evil, they don't care who they are hurting, who have affected to gain power and control,"Mediaite reported the President saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5<0xE2><0x80><0x93>3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars scored a losing match against the Belfast Giants on Friday in the Elite League by winning a 5<0xE2><0x80><0x93>3 frequency match in Dundee Saturday.
The Giants gained early lead through two logs from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised the locals before Dwyer gave the Giants a lead again.
Francois Bouchard equalised Dundee before two laps of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen gave them the win.
It was the third match to lose in the season to teammate Adam Keefe, who came from behind and defeated Dundee 2<0xE2><0x80><0x93>1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time they met in the season between the teams, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.
Dwyer's first goal reached the fourth minute at 3:35 after getting the ball from Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford gave the ball to Beauvillier to tie the second goal four minutes later.
During the first innings, Sullivan forced the natives in a 13:10 minute ahead of Matt Marquardt to give a pass that resulted in their Cownie 15:1<0x36>.
Dwyer ensured the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first period.
The natives reorganized and Bouchard once again equalised them in the 2<0x37>:3<0x37> minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran played together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period and ensure the victory for the fifth goal in the final.
The Giants, who have now lost four previous matches, will be the natives of Millton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Aircraft Traffic Controller Dies While Ensuring Hundreds of Safari in Birds Can Avoid Earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic controller has been credited with being a hero after losing his life while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people has left safe.
More than <0x38>00 people have died and others have been lost after the main earthquake occurred on the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Later vibrations continue to occur in the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to escape from his position in the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He slept to ensure that Batik Air Flight <0x36>321, which was on the road at the time, was able to fly safely.
He then flew the trolley control tower when he thought it fell.
He later died in a hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision was able to save hundreds of people, ABC News of Australia reported.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, the leadership fears that the death toll could reach thousands and the country's disaster reduction organization has said that the access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong cities are minimal.
"The number is believed to be increasing as many bodies were still stuck under the falls while challenging to reach the majority," said organisation spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The six-metre-long wave has destroyed Palu which will provide a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring support and equipment.
Reva Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is not readily available.
Small markets are broken everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is working to help victims but we don't know how things are.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation may even worse."
Indonesian president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and he told the country's army: "I'm asking you all to work day and night to complete every mission related to exile.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was struck earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini crash plane crash: Air Niugini now says one person has been lost after a plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline that owns a plane crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia has now said that one person is not available, after previously saying that all 4<0x37> passengers and crew had been safely rescued when the plane sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that by Saturday afternoon, it could not tell when he was a man.
The agency said it is working with regional leadership, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The agency did not immediately respond to requests for further details regarding passengers, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew after the plane crashed into water while attempting to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
Leaders said Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The agency said that six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of accident and a series of events is still unknown.
The agency and the United States Navy all said the plane landed at the lagoon just before they reached the route.
Some witnesses thought the plane had hit water on the road.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to walk through the water reaching them to the waist through the emergency doors of the sinking plane.
He said flight attendants were scared and shouted and that he suffered a minor injury in his head.
The U.S. Navy said the crew who were working to improve the docks closely also helped rescue them using a breath boat to transport people to land before the plane sank at about 30 metres (100 ft)
Data from the Weather Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in crash accidents registered with PNG in the last two decades but none were involved by Air Niugini.
The critic shows a record of events on the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution unit finished describing her case on Saturday in a frequency case where a man accused of stabbing a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
United States Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as a professional witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He showed a panel of judges how he used cell phone records to unify the activities of the 29-year-old defendant, <0x51>uinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on disaster night.
Rowlett said he received regional data from several cell phones that showed Tellis had Chambers on the evening of his death, contrary to his earlier claims, Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed his cell phone had Chambers' time said he had his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took a stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
While the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said they were in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he "was lying, because my car was Nashville."
"Another non-contact statement is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for only two weeks before his death.
Telephone records show that they had known each other for only one week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the text messages and Chambers' communications comments from his phone.
"He wiped him out of his life," Hale said.
The advocacy is scheduled to begin its closing points on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be sent to a panel of judges later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop?
Trinity hip hop singers want to criticize such a negative attitude by filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed, from Bristol, claim the hip hop was lost away from its origins of political message and coping with social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make a changing hip hop.
Artists such as The Fuges and Common have seen new popularity in the UK recently through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York home minister sues couple for dismissal after the message "discriminate the color"
A New York home minister accuses the couple of dismissing him on grounds of discrimination after receiving a non-wife message from a mother who complained that he was "just another black man."
Married couples refuse to be racist and symbolize the allegations with "disgust."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern after discovering that the child's new provider, Giselle Maurice, was a black man after his first day of work in 201<0x36>.
"HAPANAAAAAAAAAA ON THE REVIEW," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After discovering his mistakes, Plasco-Flaxman "concerned" fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that their departure minister, of African-American origin, had done a bad job and that he was instead expecting the Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day of work and then returned home to Uber.
Now, Maurice accuses the couple of compensation in connection with the dismissal and wants a <0x24>350 compensation per day for the sixth month, for work to live and work, though without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you're not worth doing such acts," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's prejudice."
The couple have denied allegations that they are racist, stating that stopping Maurice the job was the right step, fearing they could no longer trust him after he was wrong.
"My wife had sent her a message that she didn't intend'".
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But can you put your children in the hands of someone you're wrong, even if it's wrong?
Your baby?
Say the truth."
Comparing the charges to "a fraud," Plasco said it was only two months after his wife had a child and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Will you go to prosecute such a man?
That's not a good thing to do," the bank investor said.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has denounced the couple in social media, attacking their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers scared readers would have no preference for the talking bear, a new letter shows
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in connection with the letter: "It is hard to put himself in the shoes of a person who reads for the first time before it is published.
It's very exciting to know about Paddington's great success."
Speaking to his father, who worked as a camera minister at the BBC before getting the inspiration to write a children's book from a small bear toy, he would have no bad feelings for his job being rejected, added that the book's <0x36>0th anniversary was "happy and sad" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, who describes himself as "a very important member of our family," he added that his father enjoyed his success.
"He was a man without a lot of words and had no pride," he said.
"But because Paddington was very important to him, it's like having a successful child: you're proud even though it's not your actions.
I think he saw Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his architecture and ideas, he was always praising Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to move through the phone.
After discovering that his daughter had been summoned to Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad was calling repeatedly and said that the situation was very bad and not expected to live," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad's telling me he'll die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi , I love you so much, my baby.
I'll have you soon.
I'll have you.
The drugs that doctors had given him so that his spirit could continue to strike were slowly ending up power in his system.
He had died a while before and this was just his system to stop working.
I just had to stay there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to give myself a heart.
"At last Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning losing his daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - without knowing what he was going through.
"No one knew, he said.
"I had tilted my head and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was when I was in the plane when I felt so sorry for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved him."
Women mourn put cards to prevent suicide in the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones by suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on the Welsh bridge with a powerful message and phone numbers that people can call.
His son Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from thought pressure and suicide at the age of 1<0x38>.
"I don't want any parent to feel how I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Sydney, said his son was an optimistic chef and an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everybody said her smile was interesting to everyone."
However, he quit before he died, because he was "a dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, aged 11, was the first to find his brother after his suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm always worried that this will affect others."
Mrs. Davis created a card," enabling people to know that there are people out there that you can go and talk to them, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent - you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old boyfriend, not long after his mother's death.
He did not say that he feels bad or is bothered by ideas," he said.
"Some days before Christmas we discovered a change in her attitude.
He was completely down on Christmas Day - while the children were opening their gifts he didn't want to look at them or communicate."
He said his death led to find him, but they would have to strive to continue life: "It puts a hole in the family.
It depresses us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's hysterical finale as FBI begins investigation
"I thought, if we could find something like what he asked for - a long-term investigation, a height of size - maybe we could bring a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling" due to the complexity of the fascism.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to time.
Representative elections are held only five weeks from now, on November <0x36> - if, as expected, the Republicans fail, then they will be very weak in their effort to keep the person they want to be elected to the top court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling the Senators, persuading them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI released its report?
There will be voting in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are working.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, vice president, to break the uniform and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee population 'slows' under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un gained power seven years ago, a South Korean lawyer said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean coalition ministry, said there were 1,12<0x37> refugees last year - compared to 2,<0x37>0<0x36> in 2011.
Mr. Park said the highest control in the border between North Korea and China and the high rates of fines charged with marketing was a major factor.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
Most of the North's refugees are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the region with a large number of DMZ soldiers (a popular DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China treats refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often reintroduces them.
Relations between the North and the South - who are in reality still in war - have changed dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the evacuation of the standing nuclear weapons.
The incident came after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on broad terms to work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for lack of development ever since.
"Within no faith in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under the circumstances, no way we will remove nuclear weapons as the first," said Mr Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi refers to Brett Kavanaugh as "unconscious," and says it is inappropriate to remain in the Supreme Court
Minority Leader in Parliament Nancy Pelosi has said Supreme Court selector Brett Kavanaugh is a "non-control man" and said that he has so much feelings that he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I thought that if it were the woman she had done so, they would say 'can't control herself,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Court Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh completely denied allegations that he persecuted Dak Christine Blasey Ford while they were young.
At the time of his opening report, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost yelling and devastating about his family and his years in high school.
He also publicly denounced the Democrats on the committee, citing charges against him as being "infamous and scheduled to destroy his reputation" organized by angry Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 201<0x36> presidential election.
Pelosi stated that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved to be ineligible to last in the Supreme Court, because he indicated that he discriminated against the Democrats.
"I think he withdraws for the words and how he denounced the Clinton family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi did not refuse when asked if he tried to remove Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Democrats would be majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this <0xE2><0x80><0x93> if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then it is not appropriate not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court when he is right now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court.
Pelosi added that if the Democrat was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Price Service Act or Roe's case against Wade, because he is said to be a conservative judge.
In his evidence charges, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether he could change certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for an angry, prejudice to go to the court and expect us to say, 'it's not odd,'" said Pelosi.
And Women Should Use It.
It's a good review of the pain, months and years of more rage and can't remove it without crying.
"We cry when we're upset," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's normal, are you?"
He went on," I was very assisted by a woman who was active somewhere, who said he was also crying when he got angry, but he developed a technique that meant that when he was upset and started crying, he could tell someone he's talking to," You might think I'm sad because I cried.
I'm angry."
Then he went on to explain to me.
And I thought it was a good idea."
"The tears are allowed as a way to get rid of rage because they are basically incomprehensible.
One of my most memorable memories from my early work, is an office full of men, where I immediately found myself crying with a judicious rage, I was caught in the back of the neck by a great woman - an administrator who I was always afraid of a little - who pulled me to the ladder.
"Don't let them see that you're crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy because you and you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 19<0x38><0x37>, when Mr. Hart was found by a relationship outside of marriage in a boat known as Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Mrs. Schroeder, he became very frustrated and saw no reason to not give up for the presidency.
"It wasn't a good decision," he told me while laughing 30 years later.
"There were probably seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
There was someone who referred to this as "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign's time grew so far, he was back in raising edh and so swore that he would not enter the race unless he raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a war he was losing.
He found that some of his supporters who contributed <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 to men would only give him <0xC2><0xA3>250.
"Do they think that hiatus I get a discount?" he wondered.
When he delivered his speech to announce that he could not launch an official campaign, he was filled with feelings - thanks to people who helped him, confused with a system that made it very difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates and anger from heterosexual discrimination - until he was exhausted by breath.
"You'd think that I had a neurological crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the press took over the episode.
"You'd think the Kleenex company were my business sponsors.
I remember thinking about it, what will they put on my grave?
"He cried"?
How trade wars between the United States and China can benefit Beijing
The initial sounds in the trade war between the United States and China were very disturbing and although the war will not end soon, the differences between countries may be of benefit to Beijing for a long time, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, issued the first warning earlier this year for paying tribute to Chinese important sales including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The difference with the most impact this week began with a new tribute affecting products worth <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), charging half of all products entering the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, it has recently placed a five to ten percent tribute for <0x24><0x36>0 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to compare U.S. measures, and the second-largest country of the economy does not appear to be disappointed at any time soon.
Making Washington change means you have to accept the terms, but publicly accepting American pressure will be a great shame to <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game well, the challenges of trade wars against the United States can help China long by reducing support between the two countries.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create an environment that can begin to change in the economy in any of it and more dangerous than others previously thought," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who is focusing on Asia at the new U.S. Security Advisory Center.
Syria 'ready' in return to refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria has said that it is ready for a voluntary return to refugees and asks for help to rebuild a country destroyed by a more than seven-year war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is solidified.
"Today the real situation is more stable and secure due to the improvements made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to modify areas damaged by terrorists to rehabilitate on a regular basis.
All conditions now exist of voluntary return to refugees in the country where they had to escape due to terrorism and economic measures that affected their daily lives and careers.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government will welcome help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he insisted that they do not want help on terms or assistance from countries that funded the terrorism.

The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again as Denmark team captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had a difficult time throughout the competition, hit his first ball in the water in a 1<0x36>-hole 3-hole loss, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian player Molinari played well in all his turns and became a 1 out of 4 to 5<0xE2><0x80><0x93>0 since the current tournament format began in 19<0x37>9.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5th and 4th by the player listed at the bottom of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmaki.
The player listed in the world's first position, Dustin Johnson, was defeated 2 and 1 by Ian Poulter of England who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
The player in eight Ryder cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful European player in the competition with 25.5 points in his games.
"It's not normal for me to cry but I'm kept today.
It's been a challenging year.
Thanks to Thomas for selecting me and believing me.
I'm so happy, I'm glad to win the cup again.
The key is the team and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia who was filled with feelings after the European victory.
He transfers roles to fellow John Ram who defeated American star Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a one-man game on Sunday.
"I feel wonderful pride, defeating Tiger Woods, I was looking at him as a junior," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13<0xE2><0x80><0x93>21<0xE2><0x80><0x93>3 in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising figure from one of the highest players ever, after winning 14 titles and being only second to do so after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was overwhelmed with all-round picks keeping the ball part of the grass except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the highest level game in all competitions.
American captain Jim Furyk spoke after the lower game of his squad, "I'm proud of these players, fought.
There were times this morning when we challenged the European team.
We fought.
Most honours to Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, I'll work with our PGA alliance of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go ahead.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to give compliments.
They controlled us."
