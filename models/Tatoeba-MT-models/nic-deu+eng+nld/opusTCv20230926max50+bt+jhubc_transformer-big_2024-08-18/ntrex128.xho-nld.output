members of the Assembly (AMs) of Wales are concerned that they seem to be stupid.
There are so many amps that are concerned because it is recommended to change the way they are referred to as MWPs (the Member of Parliament of Wales).
This has been lifted because there are plans to change the name of the convention to the Parliament of Wales.
All political parties are concerned that this is going to be shattered.
One Labour AM says his team is worried that the way the new name is close to how it is called "Twp" and "Pwp."
<0xE2><0x80><0xB9> The template Infobox settlement is being considered for merging. <0xE2><0x80><0xBA> <0xE2><0x80><0xBA> <0xE2><0x80><0xBA> <0xE2><0x80><0xB9> in Welsh, <0xE2><0x80><0xBA> <0xE2><0x80><0xBA> <0xE2><0x80><0xB9> is a tweet.
The Welsh organization's AM said that the organisation did not like this, and he advised other names.
a member of the Conservatives in Wales says his team has no problem with no name change, but he has seen that it is easy to call MWP as you call a fool.
in this case the way the letter-w is pronounced in Welsh is similar to how it is called the English-language letter.
the Assembly Commission, which is busy with the legislation to change the name to the new one, said: "The decision on how to call the members of the Assembly will be taken by the members themselves."
the Government of Wales Act 201<0x37> gave the Welsh convention permission to change its name.
in June, the Commission issued the results of people's responses and found that many support the fact that the convention has changed its name as the Palamante of Wales.
in the issue of how to call AMs, the Commission favours this is the Members of Parliament of Wales or WMPs, but the public has supported this MWP.
The AMs are said to have suggested otherwise, but that it is difficult to agree on this matter should be a problem with Elin Jones, the Attorney General, who is expected to apply law for changes in the coming weeks.
the amendment legislation will include other modifications such as the way the assembly operates, including laws to discourage AMs and the formation of the committee's system.
A.Ms votes will ultimately consider when discussed the law on the question of how to be called.
the people who are willing to change the name of their country.
voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to the "South Macedonian Republic."
this vote is designed to resolve a conflict that has been going on for decades with a neighboring country of Greece with a province called Macedonia.
(The people of the province also, especially the inhabitants of the province of Asia, have had a strong dispute over the request that they become members of the EU and of the NATO.)
President Gjorge Ivanov, in opposition to the alteration vote of the name, said he will not absolutize the vote.
However, the people who support this vote, including Premier Zoran Zaev, say this change name is the value that they need to sign up to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's St. Martin's Weapons Are Unbreakable as Harlem's Churches
Mr. Adams said: "The elders I have spoken to have long been a bar and a church all over the world."
"Today, none of them are."
He said he knew why the bubbles came out.
He said, "People are having fun in a different way."
"Bibir is not a place to live in a neighborhood where people are going to go."
he's worried about the churches because he thinks the money he's got about selling his things will not last as long as the leaders think, "and it'll soon come back to the situation at the beginning."
Er added: <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Die churches kann die [aus den anderen Völkern] weggetilgt werden, da sie sich nicht mehr annehmbaren.

in 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but as Tat' Johnson's mortars were preparing for his revival, he was said to be cast.
David Johnson, the son and youngest-in-command of Tato Johnson in St. Martin's, affectionately called the bells of "the bells of the poor."

Tiffany Ng, from University of Michigan, also claimed that it was the first time on earth that this metal-blue device was played by a black music personality, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church with many steels 1<0x38> years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's never put another person in his place.
is the most important thing here in St. Martin's a few months ago was the inconsistency of architects and architects, some of whom have been introduced to church leaders who are not teachers, some of whom are the Raben church.
the congregation - the bureaucracy, composed of non-teacher guides - wrote to the general in July and concerned that the july may be responsible for the congregation, although it has not been hand-in-hand in the work of the architects and designers sent by the elite.
Some states have argued that the tax system is not a matter of fact.

Sainsbury's plans to bring its products to the UK cosmetic market
Sainsbury's competition with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by having cosmetic shops and professionals to help people.
as an important way to enter the UK cosmetic market' making <0xC2><0xA3>2.<0x38>bn, which continues to grow while fashion and household ads are low, these large cosmetics packages will be tested at 11 stores across the country, and there will be more stores next year to go on.
is to invest in cosmetics there is because these shops want to use empty shelves after being accused of television, microwave, and household items.
Sainsbury's will increase the cosmetic products that have doubled to 3,000, including names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
they already own such as L'Oral, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will have a lot of place to put them in places such as finding them in stores such as Boots.

buy online even if people now buy small food a day in nearby stores, this requires shopping malls to do more to encourage people to go to them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive said, these stores will look like supermarkets with various products, as they try to fight cheap stores such as Aldi and Lidl for more services and other food-free products.
Sainsbury's set up places where you can buy Argos from many stores and started with Habitats because they bought them two years ago. This increases the purchase of food and has made profits.
the efforts of the previous store to improve the departments of cosmetics and therapeutics fell down.
Sainsbury's father tried to meet the Boots in the early 2000s, but separated after fighting in a way to distinguish the profits of the pharmaceutical stores from its stores.
This new strategy came into existence after Sainsbury's sold Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy stores has its own pharmaceutical service of 2<0x38>1 stores for <0xC2><0xA3>125m, three years ago.
the fact that Lloyds will also be involved in this process, by expanding high-quality film products including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We've changed the way we look like parcels with our cosmetics to improve our customers.
We have invested money from specially trained employers so that they can advise them.
the products that we have various products are designed to be suitable for each requirement, make it possible for a person to find a place where they are available is easy to find, now we are a place of interesting cosmetics and that's not just how to buy old ones."

a man, described only in his "uYuan," found dead with a congenital bone, covered with blood near the source of pigs in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
the Farmer prepares for the removal of his pigs from the hag sites on May 30, 2005 at <0x58>ining in <0x51>inghai Province, China.
he is said to have been accompanied by his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
the next morning, her cousin found her dead, and she found out that the door to go to the pocket of the nearest pigs is open.
Es war aber eine große Herde von vielen Schweinen an der Weide.
the forensic research ensured that the 550-kilometre heavy pig caused him to kill the mother, according to a report.
"The legs of the cousin were bloody and curled," said the parent named after him "Wu," as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
the security cameras showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 am on Thursday that feeds pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The dog killed Yuan not his own or his cousin.
the market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been blocked so as not to attack other people, while police gathered evidence in a debris area.

the Hurricane Rosa Fregments bring to the dryness of all major rainfalls to the southwestern U.S.
as a series of weather forecasts, Herican Rosa fails as she has moved over cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flooding rainfall to northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa has <0x38>5 mph winds, Cathedral 1 Hurricane, from 5 a.m. In the Western Times on Sunday, and was located 3<0x38>5 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to go west on Sunday.
At the moment, the trough begins to take shapes in the Pacific Ocean and moves eastwards through the West Coast of the United States as Rosa is coming to California the peninsula on Monday as a tropical choir will begin to deepen the tropical depths of the Northwest.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to Mexico on Monday.
then then, the tropical humidity that interacts with the trough's coming will result in the intensity of rainfall in the Southwest in the coming days.
at home, one inch - 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, fregmentation and landslides in the wilderness.
will also allow the domestic humidity of the tropical depth will result in rain rates that will be 2 to 3 inches per hour in spots, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
even though it is expected to be 2 to 4 inches of rain in parts of the Southwest, especially on the side of Arizona.
the flow of tropical rainfall is immediately occurring under conditions of tropical rainfall.

its coming will bring some great rainfalls to the community in some parts of the Southern California coast.
the rainfall will be more than half an inch, which can cause small fragments of water flow and cause slides along the way.
The rain will be the first rain in this area to be in the water's wet season.

in the present moment, the status of the political situation continues, with the broadcast disrupting the design of the Friday's normal program to change in the last minute: an agreement made by the Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake so that the FBI can carry out a one-week investigation into the trial violation.
Ford told the Senate Administration Committee that you were 100<0x25> sure that Kavanaugh put him under the influence of alcohol and tried to free clothes from the high school party.
Kavanaugh, in evidence that conveys the body, said he was 100 percent sure that it never happened.

CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has -2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.<0x38>9 million and CNN has -2.52 million, said Nielsen.

the mother has stood in a nervous eyes for several minutes as she was criticized, talking at the moment on CNN's TV.
"I'm here before you," said the man of the woman.
"Do you think you're right in the world?
he was told, "The power while the majority of women are weak".
Flake said his office had taken out of the concrete and said, before closing the elevator, there was much he could say to the counsel committee.
the broadcast and cable networks all circulated at the moment in the next hour, while the Executive Committee would vote to further Kavanaugh's electoral appointment on the full voting site.
but Flake said that he would only do so in accordance with the FBI where he would not look at allegations against the next week's election, in which few Democrats were advised.
Flake suggested that by talking to his friend, Democrats' senator Chris Coos.
After talking to Coons and other senators then, Flake has decided.
Flake's choice is strong, as there is evidence that Republicans do not vote to accept Kavanauh unless research has been conducted.
President Trump has released a FBI investigation to investigate allegations against Kavanaugh.

The U.S. repeats A.I.'s financial support.
China has been promoting more on non-medical insight, the U.S. needs to repeat the time spent in the research sector, says financial client and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
these accounts come after the various parts of the U.S. government made AI declarations, and as the U.S. do not fail in all official AI systems.
Currently, China announced its plan last year : it was aimed at being No.1 on AI's design in 2030.
in "AI research budget repetition will be a good starting point, as all other countries behind the U.S., and we look at the next AI design," Lee said.
the repetition of funding can repeal the chances of next major AI success that will be held in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book "Great Power in AI: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which funded one of the largest AI<0x2B> companies in China.

Lee said the change of foreign immigration police could help support its AI efforts.

if they don't want to accept it like Macedonia, we can convert countries like China and Russia into part of the Euro-Asia coalition."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the most needed investment in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20<0x25>.
"I believe that most people will love that because more than <0x38>0<0x25> of Nato and the EU's loved ones," said Zaeve after voting in a bibliography.
He said that "yes" will be the result of "confirming our future."

Scherzer wants to play when playing Spoiler vs. Rockies
when the Nationals division is being made into a playoff conflict, there is no reason to force it to be re-introduced.
But the contestant Sherzer hopes to find a rising place on Sunday when he plays with Colorado Rockies, but only when the results are confined to the Rockies' playoffs, with the lead rate in the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western NL.
the Rockies finished at least with a wild-card slip where they won 5-2 at the Nationals on Friday night, but they still looked at their title in the first round.
"Even if we don't play for nothing, at least we can't put the bubble on the rubber we know the nature of Denver's situation and the viewer and other groups of any high-quality point that I'm facing this year.
Why don't I fight?"
the Nationals have already announced that they have started on Sunday, but have made a statement of encouragement so that Scherzer has spoken in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will begin in the 34th grade, made a ballpenning session on Thursday and will do his usual rest on Sunday.

this big, big election —I'm not running away and I don't really forget that's why I'm so full of everywhere I'm fighting to find people who will represent us worthy," he said.
Trump continued: "You see bad things, the bad things of a group of Democrats, you see what is happening at the moment.

The Labour is no longer owned.
It is not tolerated to speak to those who speak what they think
While the Momentum's Activists in my local group voted against me, I was quite proud.
After all, I'm the main figure in the list of Labor MPs to be told unreliable - all of them speak what they think.
. . . . . <0xE2><0x80> . . <0xE2><0x80> . . .
in my case, the case of my criticism and criticism is inconsistent with Jeremy Corbyn.
in the important police force of the active economic system, national security, in Europe, by addressing parallel issues in which Jeremy disagrees with previous leaders.
Nottingham East Labour's meeting notice on Friday wrote that "we want the meetings to be energetic and have the right results."
I've been working in the local MP for almost every eight years, GC's evening meetings on Friday have always been exactly the same.
in the present day, this modern meeting is not a summit of the meetings that we often have "kind and soft, low, political tea" that parents are running away from, however, never to start again.
the term seems to be a growing diversity of opinion that differs are not accepted in the Labour group and all the opinion is reviewed before being accepted into the caretaker group.
This begins after Jeremy entered the leadership chairman, as a colleague and pastor I thought to share with him a politically oriented view of his own and is expected to turn faster and take places that I never agreed to agree with - whether it is a social security or a commercial one.
is whenever I speak out - and what I don't care about - and follow the protests on communications pages that are said to be on the seat, accepted by the city's politics, I am told that I am not enough to be in the Labour Party.
And that's my experience.
I know I'm more lucky than my colleagues, as the policies are brought directly to me and have become politically motivated.
I respect the art and determination of my colleagues who deal with daily gender or racial harassment, but they can't take away from them.
one of the most devastating aspects of this political system is the way it is at the heights of popularity and popularity.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labor team has taken part in the tradition of tolerance.
the truth is that we are no longer of your own large and in the form of "untrustful" or changing the principles of the class of subtlety.
I've had many suggestions over the past two years asking me to let me go, not talk about what I'm talking about and then "all it's right."
But that's not what I'm doing in politics.
I had joined Labour in 32 years as a schoolboy, to be suspicious of the government of Tatcher's attention to not neglecting the room I had read in which he left me down, since then I vowed that I would fight for the best public services and needs, too - whether the administration or the government.
hasn't been hidden from political involvement, including from previous elections.
no one in the East of Nottingham can be confused by any way about my position in my police, and in the areas I disagree with the current leaders.
in these conditions that are now updated on Friday, in all of which I say while Brexit is influenced by harming in our local, business, and public services, I don't understand his desire to spend time and the strength of my confidence in the leader of the Labour team.
The only real fact is that the one message I have is not in Nottingham Momentum, will be my people, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud of working under you and I promise that there is no price left from fears or political help can prevent me from doing what I believe to be your premeditated needs.

Ayr 3<0x38>-1<0x37> Melrose: Ayr moves forward
The two late tries are focused on the closest winners that almost lead to the results, but there is no doubt that Ayr should this victory be so beautiful for the celebration of Tennent's Premiership Day game.
now increases the rate, which is the lowest possible.
finally, it was their high-quality safety, as much as their chance of taking a better chance, resulting in the fulfillment of the domestic side and coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we are not yet beaten, so we have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "To congratulate Ayr, we did better than we did."
Grant Anderson in his try in 14 minutes, replaced by Frazier Clima, he put Ayr in the past, but, the yellow card of the Scottish cap by Rory Hughes, was released into the game by Warriors, allowing Melrose to make smuggled and pointed edges.
the Ayr's leadership, before, in the half-time of the game, has posted an article and then changed the try to 1<0x37>-5 on Ayr during the rest of the game.
but Melrose started well the second half and Patrick Anderson's trailer, which Baggot's turn, reduced the chance of five points.
has been said to have been rapid for a long time due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who has been released with a stroke, and when the Ayr was re-emergized, the Ayr has quickly risen by Stafford McDowall, which has been converted by Alimo.
Ayr's holding captain Blair Macpherson has been given a yellow card, and again, Melrose has paid one man with an untranslated tractor of Bruce Colvine, under pressure of power.
However, it is back home and then when Struan Hutchinson is given a yellow card due to squeezing Agriculture with no ball outside the penalti line, MacPherson has gone to bed behind as Ayr is known.
Climo has changed, as almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe merged David Armstrong's balls into the box and sent off Gregor Henry's flagship away by installing the fifth tray.

'Our sea': Bolivia is trapped on earth in hopes that the road will open its way to Pacific
the mariners are the capital of La Paz masts.
All of the buildings of the public end the blue flag.
from Lake Titicaca to Amazon is well known by the words: "Our sea legally.
Let's get back to our work."
and throughout Bolivia closed to the earth, the memories of the coastlines taken by Chile in the war of wealth that had suffered a lot of bloodshed in the 19th century still in mind - as is the desire to re-enter the Pacific Ocean.
are perhaps these prospects are the most efficient in the centuries, as Bolivia awaits the world's judicial hearing on October 1 after five years of debate.
"Bolivia is powerful, the spirit of unity and calm, and they are waiting in good spirit for the results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
a lot of Bolivians will listen to the ruling of the World Court of Law in the largest screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will stand on Bolivia's claim that - after decades of being reconnaissance - Chile is forced to give Bolivia a seaport.
Evo Morales, the Bolivian president who has a life and family life - who face a heavy battle to be re-elected next year - also has much to do with this Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," said in late August.
but some analysts think that it is unlikely that the judgement on Bolivia's side - it will not change so much.
the United Nations-based Federation of the Netherlands-powered Chilean earth-promotion, and it says that it is impossible to know the possible results of speech.
the fact that the World Court of Justice's ruling came only six months after the discussion indicates that the case was "unquestionable," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on world law.
and rather than cope with Bolivia's wishes, four years may have returned.
"The issue of sea access has been carried by the existing Bolivian government," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's defenses have concluded any kindness they still had in Chile," he said.
Bolivia and Chile will talk again one day, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not been colonial since 19<0x36>2.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, a Bolivian Ambassador to The Hague, has snubbed what the court has made a very odd decision.
on Monday he will give Bolivia a "special opportunity to reveal on a new page of cooperation with Chile" and the opportunity to "end 139 years of incompetence to the advantages," he said.
Calzadilla has also challenged the fact that Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - uses this seafood as a political supporter.
"Bolivia will never simply abandon its right to access to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"This is a time for us to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says it will not remove nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States
North Korean Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not be able to separate its nuclear weapons first if he does not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday in the United Nations legislature.
he asked the United States to follow the promises made during a conference in Singapore among leaders facing eye-catching courses.
he said these words when once the President of the State Mike Pompeo appears to have resumed a nuclear negotiation over three months after those in Singapore and Kim Jong Un in North Korea.
Ri says it's "sleeve of the day" that the ongoing and unrest of the United States is a motion ending the Korean War will result in the North's surrender.
the Washington is careful to acknowledge this agreement before Pyongyang first took steps to dissolve these devices.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are looking for a second meeting.
but many people doubt that Pyongyang is willing to sacrifice the weapons that are considered this country as the only way to ensure it is safe.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim and Trump's rally.

John Edward: The linguistic skills of the world's people
the independent schools of Scotland have a reputation for progressive learning, and this has continued in 201<0x38> with other results of exams that have not yet gone, which is strengthened by each individual and the success of a team of sports, art, music, and other public campaigns.
as they have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to provide high service quality to their students and parents.
are independent schools trying to prepare their students when they go to higher levels of education, selective courses, and their place as people living in the world.
as an educational sector that can design and install a school curriculum suitable for situations, we see existing languages continue as a popular and selective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela: "If you speak to a person in a language that understands, he reaches his mind.
"He will speak to you in his mouth to get your words."
this is a strong reminder that we cannot trust in English to build relationships with trust and trust with foreign nationalists.
from the recent results of the exam, we can see that the languages are higher in the table with a high degree of passing to independent schools.
<0x36><0x38><0x25> of foreign language learners have scored Higher Grade A scores.
of the collected information, in <0x37>4 schools of SCIS members, indicates that <0x37>2 percent of students have received Higher Grade A in Mandarin, while <0x37>2 percent of those who read German, <0x36>9 percent of those who learn French and those who are <0x36>3<0x25> of Spanish.
this indicates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills for children and young people who are looking for sure in the future.
now linguistics, as a selective subject, are equally as well as STEM courses (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and others.
a study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for the reasons offered by employers to have a job-filling problem, 1<0x37> percent are associated with the lack of language skills.
more and more, language skills will become necessary to provide young people with the tasks they will perform in the future.
as more work spaces require languages, these skills are essential in a cooperative world.
no matter what job you choose, if you learn a different language, you will have a greater chance in the future to have such a perpetual ability.
The ability to communicate directly with other people has made it possible for a person who knows many languages.
. . . . . YouGov's claim made to over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, <0x37>5 percent of them were unable to speak another language well enough to talk, and only French spoke of more than one percent, 15 percent.
That's why investing in linguistics is now essential for children.
the knowledge of many languages, especially those in developing countries, will empower children with good opportunities to find a job that is exciting.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages we teach.
a number of schools will pay attention to the existing modern languages, while others will teach languages that are thought to be of great importance in the UK when viewed in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
no matter what your child likes, there will always be a number of languages you can choose from independent schools, there are teachers who relax in this section.
the Scottish independent schools are committed to preparing a teaching environment that will provide children with the skills needed to succeed, no matter where they are going in the future.
is now inaccurate, in the form of the world industry, that languages continue to become an important part of the country's future, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be considered as "the ability to communicate with the world."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, to break and relax for young people in Scotland.

So, who are we now going forward?
"Give them six points and now they're a relative, so I think we're going forward," said Jordan Spieth while traveling that day.
Europe has taken the opportunity, in fact, with four more points and the other 12 are not guaranteed.
the Mechanics, as Spieth says, that you feel like it's going well and there's so many who can find interest there, including how Spieth and Justin play well all day and the couple have three to four points.
Spith has been playing well since the start and is for example.

Europe has played better as a team so far and is leading up to the final day but four players have shown that the American team flies an irregular interest if possible, especially the Stateside.

North Korea says that we will ‘never finish its equipment before it gets safe.'
the minister of the foreign center in North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that these judgments made a reliability between the United States and there was no way that the United States could complete its Nuclear devices when they could not obtain security assurances.
Ri Yong Ho told the board of the beneficiaries to take good measures last year, such as discontinuing the testing of equipment and the dissolving of Nuclear-powered areas, and also making a promise that we would never make Nuclear instruments again.
" however, we don't see the dependable measures from the United States," he said.
"When there is no promise from America there will be no hope in the security of our country and in this case we will never disable our weapons without talking to the United States."
even though Ri reiterates what North Korea said about the American refusal to complete Nuclear equipment in the lower stages and that North Korea is paid for about the small steps they took, his report did not deny that Pyongyang's actions to complete the efficient equipment.
Ri speaks of a joint report issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in the first meeting between the president of the United States and the North Korea ruler of Singapore on June 12, when Kim promises to work "complete Nuclear devices instead of Korea" during Trump's declaration
North Korea wanted to bring an end to the Korean war of 1950-53 officially, but the United States has said that Pyongang should eliminate Nuclear weapons first.
the Whington has seldom applied to mitigate difficult international sanctions against North Korea.
the "America enforces "the completion of Nuclear instruments first" and increases the level of pressure by judging them to achieve their purpose in a compelling manner, which also describes the declarations of end of war," says Ri.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Die Vorstellung, dass man keine Unwahrheit vor uns hat.
The problem, however, is that these sentences are increasing distrust."
Ri has not talked about plans for Kim and Trump's rally, which the U.S. President has discussed before the United Nations this week.
Instead the minister spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean and chief executive Moon Jae-in five months ago and added: "If a team in this case of passing Nuclear equipment is South Korea and not America, is the completion of Nuclear equipment instead of Korea."
However, Ri's talk sounds different than last year, when he spoke to the general assembly of the U.N. Says the target of North Korea's flying equipment in the U.S. country was inevitable after "Mn. Wicked President" Trump called Kim "a man of suicide bombers."
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, gave Kim a bold praise by taking measures to disarm the equipment, but that is what is more than a large number of main tasks and the judgments will stay away from North Korea to complete Nuclear devices.
said on Wednesday, Trump said he had no time to do so, saying that "if it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter"
China and Russia say that the U.N. Security Council should address Pyongyang with the steps he has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council's Thursday: "The enforcement of the Security Council's judgments is not going to continue strongly until we see the complete and sure completion of Nuclear's equipment."
the Security Council has expanded sanctions in accordance with North Korea since 200<0x36> with the purpose of the abolition of the funding of Pyonyang's flying Nuclear equipment systems.
Pompeo has met Ri beyond the U.N. General Assembly and said he is visiting Pyonyang again to prepare for the second session.
Pompeo has been visiting North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
he left Pyonyang on July saying that it was more than the progress made, but North Korea claimed that he made "such demands as those known as robbers."
North Korea promised to meet Moon this month so that they could break the space of flying Nuclear equipment that the United States "consistent measures."
said Kim told him that the "consistent measures" that Trump needs security assurances are promising in Singapore and the progress in a normal relationship with Washington
Harvard students take a sufficient rest lesson.
a new study at Harvard University this year makes all students who have not been carried in enough sleep for the purpose of fighting the culture of learning overnight using caffeine.'

This year's study explains the benefits of sleeping in the development of education and sports, including improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatric studies at Harvard Somalia School and a senior director of medical services at the university, said the university decided to bring this subject after getting students who are not really asleep.
This study takes about an hour-long period of time, which includes sequential activities.
is in one section in the picture of the university bedroom, where students are clicking cupcakes of coffee, hints, training clothes and books for the purpose of clarifying the effects of caffeine and light and how poor sleep affects the development of sports.
in one section, participants are told how sleep sufficient to increase the risk of heart attacks, one side-stroke, stress disorder, and cancer.
in the school map, with intriguing features, encourages participants to think of the everyday phenomena.
'We know we will never change the behavior of the students' immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - as you have the right to know the health effects of cigarette smoking," Czeisler says.
the culture of malnutrition is still present, which adds that the art of the present era and stress for students who make them sleep is a growing problem
in order to ensure that sleep is enough should be an unknown tool to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - and also to avoid obesity, as sleep depresses the mind, makes it always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old who lived in California who studied chemical and biochemistry, helped Professor Czeisler to do the class's academic work, after going to his first class in his first year at Harvard.
She says the class has opened the eyes and gives her an interest in making the class available for the whole school.
he expects that the next step to ask students who are carried out to do the same learning process before entering the institution is competitive.
n are Czeisler suggesting that the students think they have made an alam of the sleep, and of the awakening, even if they are careful with the harmful effects of the light of the gas machine screens and LED lighting, which may interfere with the sequence of your daily activities, which can lead you to sleep problems.
Livingston's 1-0 Rangers Menga defeated Gerrard's men with one article
The Rangers faced a problem again when playing on a walk as Dolly Menga beat Steven Gerrad with one point in a 1-0 win at Livingston.
on the side of the Ibrox was interested in winning it was still the first time after St. Johnstone had beaten it 4-1 on February. but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for the second time in the match at 1<0x38> which he started to become the manager as the losing of eight points outside the forward team Prop.
Menga received a note in the high-temperature voice ahead of the Half-Time and the Rangers players were interested.
a. while the Rangers fell to the sixth place, Livingston went third behind it by Hibernian leaving with one point.
And there are problems with the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence suffered from a head injury after suffering from a miscarriage comes from the side of the puppets.
Gerrard has changed players from time to time to time with Ayr in the final game of the Betfred Cup.
on the other hand, Holt continues with 11 similar Livingstone players who took the same point in Hearts a week ago and enjoyed the way his team beat its opponents in every way.
The Rangers didn't control the game, but Livingstone did add while they got the ball.
he should have scored in the second innings while Menga's player allows Scott Pittman to pass to Allan McGregor's poles but the midfielder didn't find it.
Keaghan Jacobs kicked the ball found by Craig Halkett but his partner Alan Lithgow was able to open a wide range of posts in the back.
The Rangers did not gain control but looked more optimistic than the beliefs about the third game before the final.
Alredo Morelos feels that he should have received a penaltin in the half-hour sign as he and Steve Lawless clashed but pamphlet Steve Thomson did not ignore the Colombian player's call.
The Rangers had the opportunity to skip ball near the Palestinians before finishing the first stage of the game but the champion who played for Ibrox Liam Kelly had no problem with the ball covered by Lassa Coulibaly's head and accompanied by Ovie Ejaria.
even though Livingstone got the first score in 34 minutes that has been hard to find it, no one can deny that they really deserve it without working hard at all.
The Rangers are also unable to prevent the ball played by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not act as Declan Gallagher who passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was not worried about the goal of winning Maya.
Gerrard made a change at first as Coulibaly installed Ryan Kent for this change that dropped the results immediately as the player who opened Morelos but this outstanding player even ran away from the block.
But Livingston has continued to make the team play on the trip to play what he wants, and Lithgow and Halkett have been running away from the ball again.
the Holt team could get a note at the beginning of the game but McGregor has even firmly denied Jacobs earlier that Lithgow had been placed in the poles with his head.
one Rangers player lately Glenn Middleton had another claim of judgment as a difficult dispute with Jacobs but he also did not compromise Thompson.

is how to do so involves removing the cells of the body's fiber cells from the patient, then switching them to laboratory until they "see" normal proteins to the cancers called HER2, and restoring them to the body again.
the university teacher Jay Berzofsky, of the American National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a vaccine that is not really effective."
HER2 has "continued the growth of various cancers of interest." including breast cancer, ovarian, gastrointestinal and gastrointestinal cancer, the university's teacher Berzofsky explains.

a review of the Johnny English Strikes Again - a collection of Rowan Atkinsos
It is common in the days to look for things about Brexit when watching an English-related film is the same as this old-fashioned revival film and the adventures of Johnny English <0xE2><0x80><0x93> disbanded in 2003 rebo in 2011 called Johnny English.
Is it possible for this exciting movie to talk about the news that we're not able to download abroad?
the person of a pope named Johnny English obtains his license to revive - that is his name that indicates that he is a vampire designed by non-English viewers in other countries.
he is really the work of the Intellectual State who performs in a different way with Clouseau, and Mr. Bean, at least at the same time, sing a musical note in the Chariots of Fire in the 2012 opening event of the London Olimpians.
she even became a traveler and a world-renowned man of secrets Atkinson who had then marketed Barclaycard's television advertisements, which burned the conflicts of the ske moving there.
At one or two moments in the movie JE.
I love this time Johnny English came to a helicopter in front-of-the-scenes protective clothing during the time he was beating his hat.
Atkinson's gift of humor that doesn't sound interesting, but it doesn't have much strength compared to heavy products such as 00<0x37> and the Mission Impossinle that includes now-defunct greys.
I'm not looking for kids and not adults, when I'm speaking on the side of Johnny English's humor show no skill compared to Atkinson's unwarranted movies while playing Bean
The news in the movie that the English people are in serious trouble
the online scout has entered into an accident on the net of online material, saw the details of all active English magicians, until the applicant at work - a very small role of Kevin Eldon.
The news has just gone over with a proud high-ranking, politically unpopular minister: Emma Thompson tries to do what is right as he plays Teresa May but the author of the movie did not work well when he wrote it
Er sagte zu ihnen, dass jeder von ihnen so viel Geld gebe und dass er es im eigenen Bereiche der von ihm festgesetzten Zeit geben sollte.
And that's what the fool Johnny English is himself, who has won the position of head teacher at the school for the best, but gives lessons incorrectly to being anonymous writers, while English teaches in an unusual way how to be a mastermind than in real times.
English is returned to Whitehall and told by emergency he met his best friend who was suffering from Bough, who is played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is a married man, married to the controller of the underwater yacht.
the couple with the ability to do the wrong things of the slave service go back to work, and they meet Ophelia Bulletova who is consumed by Olga Kurylenko
while, the senior minister believes a billion billionaire of technology that we can solve these problems of English computers: the evil man Jason Volts, played by Jake Lacy
the young English and Bough began the trauma: they made the food providers, burned the French food store; they began problems when they boarded a Volta's rich ship; and English brought an attack while trying to use Virtual Reality's headwear for the purpose of reading the house.
everything in the last sections, although interesting and entertaining, is more than the television programs of the children who talk about it all.
It's common.
Just like all other Johnny English movies: I wonder if this English-language film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson an appropriate role in his ability?
a group of workers deny that they make a plan for British residents to work for four days but have been arrested for five days.

a four-week transfer to support the Trades Union Congress as a means of employee taking a post to economic change.
the top source of the Labour Party told Sunday Times: ‘A system inspection is expected to be announced before the year passed.
the ‘we will not happen immediately but a four-day working week is the idealistic idea of this group of economic youth measurements so that they can be next to the employee and the business plan of this group.’
the work team is not the first to provide support for such ideas, and the Green Party made a four-day plan while swinging support for the 201<0x37> elections.
This program currently does not receive full support from the Labour Party, however.
a spokesperson for the Working Group said: ‘The four-day working week is not a group process and it is not a matter of consideration.’
the assistant manager John McDonnell used a week ago work conference to clarify his idea about the economic reform that helped people.
Mr. McDonnell says he is determined to take the power of ‘administrators who do not want to be seen by someone' and ‘who earns' in large businesses.
and the assistant manager's program states that the owners of the water retailers may not receive their share as a labor government would pay ‘payment' that they do not do well.

He was calm, confident, fearless."
However, it seems, Graham's vote will never change.
"We've made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's necessary for a serious break," he said.
Gqirh. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I don't know what I know: Brett has denied the strength of these pleasures," adds Graham, speaking to Chrstine Blasey Ford.
"Everyone is talking about him who can confirm these accusations.

"National legislation requires that all regulatory applications be considered in the facts and conditions of the application, and this law shall terminate it," says a court-defense licence."
the plaintiffs reiterate this law preventing runners from entering the United States to damage American economy, saying that they are more likely to be in business and do the necessary tasks."
General Representative Jeff Sessions has issued a law to the judge whose runners may be provided with security if they run for domestic violence or the violence of gangs starting in June.
"Security will be found by anyone who has gone home because of persecution or because of nationality, religion, or political opinion," said Sessions on June 11 while reporting in this law.
the safety has not been made to deal with all the problems - and also the difficulties - the people they face every day around the globe.

the U.S. national representative alleging China is now ‘using' using ‘false adverts'
a week after the official newspaper of China made a four-page advertisement on the U.S. paper daily talking about the commercial gains of the United States and China, a U.S. ambassador to China alleging the country by means of a U.S. media to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week spoke about the China Daily in the DesMoines Register - an Iowa's most-selling newspaper - embassy to accuse China of smuggling the November <0x36> election, which is China's suspicious allegation.
Trump's allegation that China is trying to interfere with the election is what American officials tell Reuters that a new section of the ongoing campaign that the United States has put pressure on China.
and it is common for governments in various countries to install them in advertising to promote trade, China and the United States are fighting for trade at the moment and investing in unprecedented prices.
the China boosts prices start this trade problem and is designed to affect exporters in state-of-the-art sectors such as Iowa that form the Trump Republican Party, according to experts in China and the United States.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the old governor of Iowa, which initiates China the majority of the dietary sector, said, China has injured American employers, farmers and businesses.
in China, Branstad wrote his opinion on the Des Moines Register, "it is now determined to exploit us by incorporating false ads on our free sheets."
"When it spreads false news, the Chinese government puts itself at the risk of hearing America using its common tradition of free speech as well as the free media and advertising site in the Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"In contrast, instead of the media here in Beijing when you drop the strato, you'll get a little bit of disconnected views and you'll never see how China really thinks about China's economic advance, we think that the media is in the Chinese communist party," he writes.
he added that "one of the most common newspapers in the lake has denied his request to release the news" no matter what the newspaper is.

in advance of Ford's public evidence that clarifies his allegations regarding the detention of the High Court of Sexual Abuse, analysts say it could have positive consequences when Republicans require a confirmation.
"This has changed the problem about the GOP," said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee last week when it began, according to NBC News.

in addition, 3<0x38> percent of those who have believed that Kavanaugh is the possibility of a kany are sure to lie while providing evidence, at the same time only 30 percent have said the same thing about Ford.

the Internet developer made plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an online producer, begins a new business aiming at competing with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
this technology color has a new Inrupt system, which is a Solid-produced enterprise that is a process that is available to everyone.
the Solid allows its users to choose that their personal information is protected and who has the permission to see those details.
in an interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee negotiated the Inrupt's purpose to "rule the whole world."
"We have to do it now," he says in this business.

The company calls it "with personal knowledge-oriented."
the Inrupt plan, according to the business's top manager John Bruce, to bring the tools, processes and compatible skills to make Solid available to everyone.
is a company currently owned by Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM-owned system, employees who are promoting this process and the community of volunteer manufacturers.
from this week, global technological producers can produce a program that has made all of them specialized using methods of using them that are found on the sex of the internet.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team spoke "with Facebook and Goodle about how he hasn't released any major changes that can cause their business to end up immediately.
"We won't ask for their permission."
"Berners-Lee," wrote in a Medium on Saturday, said Inrupt's purpose "to provide interesting businesses and a place to protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-made internet."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet while creating the World Wide Web Consortium for Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
in the hearing moons, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in this discussion of internet neutrality.

Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley feels ‘judged' because of his sexuality
the Olympian Tom Daley says he has grown to be young because of his sexual nature - but it gives him an interest in winning.
The 24-year-old said that I saw the second school that "I'm not like anyone else."
of the first Desert Island Discs program by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he says he speaks of the rights of gay people to give them "hope."
she said that she would be a parent to have her in charge of not to take over the Olympics.
The program's most common manager, Kirsty Young, has spent months crying due to illness.
to emerge as a man who has been abandoned in Laverne's first tabernacle, Daley says that she felt the least while growing up because "it was forbidden to love girls and girls."
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Soar to that day, die Gefühle der Feminist und der Vereinbarung, ist das, was die energischen und energehörenden enchantments.
she wanted to be <0xE2><0x80><0x9E>something," she said, so that she wouldn't be ashamed of everyone when they find out about her sexual orientation.
the winner of the double-time Olympics has been publicly mentioned by LGBT and has used his fame this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask countries who are not allowed to make evidence officially.
he said that he felt lucky for being able to live without hiding himself from problems and wanting to give others a "hope."
the world's three-time winner said that he fell in love with another man - American film producer in 2013 - "unexpected."
Daley is married to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than last year but says that the post that they left them was never a problem.
the "When you deal with things like a young man" - go to his early Olympics at the age of 14 and his father has died of cancer three years later - he says it was hard to find someone of the same age who faces similar life problems.
The couple were parents in June, finding the son of a young man calling Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that "all his thoughts" have changed.
"If you asked me last year I would tell you that I need to ‘ find a gold coin'," he said.
"You know, it's great things to finish the Golden Olympics.
in the description of the Golden Robbie."
his son has the same name as his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the doctor received psychotherapy.
Daley says his father never accepted his death and one of the last comments asked if they had London tickets in 2012 - as they wanted to stay ahead.
und sie werden nicht auf den Händen tragen, damit sie nicht etwa ihre Stätte finden.
"I took him by hand when he finished breathing and I saw after he was not breathe that he too could not live forever," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics for the winners of the tournament.
"I have come to see that this was what I always dreamed of - the sinking of the water in front of the crowd at the Olympics, there's no better way I didn't feel," he said.
It also gave her interest that she said her first song - the Proud made by Heather Small - which always gave her an interest in front of the military and was horrifying.
Desert Island Discs is available on BBC Radio 4 at Sonto at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's non-game player is put in a bench in the Ryder Cup game on Saturday
Mayor Phil Mickelson will make a new record for Sonto when he plays his 4<0x37>th game of the Ryder Cup but he has to change his playing style so that he does not make this happy record.
Mickelson, who plays in this 12-year-old event, was drafted by Captain Jim Furyk in a 4-ball match with 4 people.
. instead of being placed by the crowds, such as usual when playing for America, the five-time winner spent half his day playing and re-trained for the purpose of fixing the problem.
he can't play even though he's high in the game, the 4<0x38>-year-old player is not well suited to play at Le Golf National, where the smoke exists and makes it difficult for bad footballers.
in the case of a play-by-play horror by itself, Mickelson, in the ninth game with Sonto, facing Francesco Molinari who is very well-published for the British Open, who has made a partnership with Tommy Fleetwood who is still learning to win all their games this week.
Mechanics, less than 4 points. good start of 12 solo games, Mickelson's game becomes extremely important.
Fryk has shown confidence in her husband as she expects.
"He was fully aware of his role today, he hit me a little behind me when his arm said he will be ready for tomorrow,"
"Trust yourself.
you've found a place in the hall of fame and added a lot to the group in the past period, and this week.
I didn't think he could play two games.
I hadn't thought she was going to be playing more than we did, but we didn't go the way we were.
You want people to know, like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record of playing many games in the Ryder Cup in the Football League.
to decide to play in the Ryder Cup that is not like his personal record.
Mickelson wins 1<0x38> times, is divided into 20 times he was half-sister, although Furyk said that he had made himself in the invisibility of the team.
you're "laughing, you've got a quick laugh, a quick response, you like funny people, and you're a good guy to have him in the group room" she explains.
"In the audience to see young players laughing about him at this week was glad to see what it was"
"Von Ewigkeit her wird der Herr verkünden."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows that it can lose the position of a fast forward.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows that we can quickly lose the position of forward as a team is still a leading figure in the Ryder Cup but that can change at any time.
this marked start to play in 199<0x37> in the Valderrama, where the side by Severe Ballestros led five points ahead of America but finished in the final, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You'll tell yourself that you have a lot of scores in Valderrama; you have many points in Brookline, where we're eaten and Valderrama, where we're won, hard," Bjorn, installed in the image, after watching the 201<0x38> kilometer win 5-3 Friday and Friday's 10 points
Das ist die Geschichte, daß wir alle und alle, wenn es um die Sache geht.
We're going to go out tomorrow's
We will do all we can to do.
This has not yet been done until the points on the board.
aimed at the goal, and is trying to overcome this definition is where we are aimed at.
I've also said again, aimed at 12 players on my side, but we know we're dealing with anything of the same calendar - the best players in all the world."
in the happy way his players played in this heavy playground, Bjor added: "I didn't really think of this.
The next day we're talking about something different.
The next day is looking for the ability to play a person, and that's different.
in the context of having a partner there when things go well, but when you're alone, you start testing your strength as a golfer.
Und es wird geschehen an dem Tage, an welchem alle diese Worte eintreffen werden, das soll zur Vollendung kommen.
Now, you'll never have your partner and you have to show it again."
in contrast to Bjorn, the other person Jim Furyk is looking for his players to play well on their own not as a team, except for Jordan Apeith and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk has also been the second of the last day's turntables, becoming the side of Brookline when he won and when they were split as Europe made "a miracle in Medinah."
"I remember everything he says," said Ben Crenshaw's 1999 captain, how he put them in the interest while they're going to be on the last day.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but you shouldn't think of what you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When you start to win each other, put pressure on the game in the middle of the game.
in order to present our players in a manner that will produce positive results, you know, we want to make a magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given a job as a defensive back and facing Rory McIlroy in high-profile, facing Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter's high-profile Yurpohu.
"I'm going with this group of men in a plan because I think you're dealing with everything," says Bjorn in this choice of individuals.
The German warship has been re-designated.
the new jalimanship should not be released in 2014 so that it does not replace the warships known as the Cold War, but also the following year it would not be released due to ship problems and prices, according to local news reports.
the release of "Rheinland-Pfalz," a ship that is headed by Baden-Wuettermberg-class frigates, was delayed in the first half of 2019, according to a spokesperson for the military.
the vessel should not have to be entered the Navy in 104, but the later it was to be made it was possible.
the four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg in 200<0x37> and will enter the Bremen shipyard in 200<0x37>.
the fact that it was to draw a powerful powerful weapon, as well as to fire other ships and flights and other technologies that would make them invisible to Radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important factor is that it takes a long time before it needs to be repaired - it can go for two years without home.
Nevertheless, ongoing distractions make new ships - which are said to provide Germany with power overseas - to be out-of-date when being evaluated.
the brigged ship has been issued in reserve last year, while the Jalimane navy opposed to officially withdrawing the ship returned it to Blom <0x26> Voss at Hamburg
Initially the naval ship will return the ship to the manufacturer after it has been brought.
Little well known about the reasons for the restoration of the ship but the German media argue that there are problems with "machines and clothes" that make the ship work well which has made the ship unused during the war.
the more efficient machines such as the Baden-Wuerttemberg levels are used by 120 people at all - half of the people that are forced to use Old Bremen.
on the other hand, it seems that the ship has a very heavy weight to reduce its capabilities and that the navy would not be able to improve it in the future.
the <0x37>,000-seater "IRheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be a pair to pass such ships that were used for jumances in the second world war.
in addition to the inefficient goods, the values of all the work - including teaching prices for employers to use - are beginning to have a problem.
is said to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.<0x36>bn) - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion
the problems of new ships have become crucial when it is revealed that the German Navy's power is decreasing.
First of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the commander of the German security committee, admitted that the navy is "boats in battle."
the official says the problem of age has been going on, because older levels have been removed from the military but could not be new.
he said that no other Baden-Wuerttemberg ships were able to enter the navy.
the New Trust tells the news of flying animals such as monsters
the new phonographs made in Scotland Highlands want to clarify how these animals use their position to produce food.
it is hoped that the results will illuminate us how these animals behave and how they can be protected.
the study conducted by the Scottish National Trust will follow these common animals, making an angry like soprano, long-distance and Daubenton at the Inverness Gardens at Wester Ross.
the special record machines will be placed in an important place in this area so that they can see what happens between the time of the year.
the NHS employees and volunteers will perform a survey of the locals with hand-held machinery.
the simulators will have all records to see the frequency of the animals they meet and what this kind of thing does.
the map of the animal's residence and report will be made to illustrate the behavior of these animals.
Rob Dewar advises NTS' natural protectors, hoping that the results will see the arrival of these animals in favour of what type of place the animals are used.
and these details will help you to know what the benefits of protecting the zoo and how we can maintain wildlife habitats.
The survival of animals in Scotland and the UK has decreased over the past few years.
Damned with the construction and improvements of the wildlife.
air and light Turbines can put these animals at risk and flying pages and chemicals from buildings, as well as cat attacks.
The animals aren't able to see them.
However, the need for baking day-to-day meals is more frequent than their siblings when it comes to eating.
they are getting their diets in their anger while you go back to their ears are able to see what food or restrictions are when they fly.
NTS, responsible for evacuating some 2<0x37>0-year-old areas, 3<0x38> important yards and <0x37><0x36>,000 hectares of land in the country, thinks these animals are important.

This center has developed a terrain of these mammals that are only in Scotland in the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, with <0x38> species of animals.
David Thompson's manager David Thompson says this is the right place for them.
"Here in the Threave we have a beautiful place for these animals," he said.
"We have old places, old trees and a beautiful living space.
a lot of animals you don't know about anonymous animals, the work we do here and other places will help us explain what they need to live."
he says the importance of exploring these animals before taking care of the place is as important as if the injury to the animal children's place may be 400 children's deaths, which does not complete all of that kind.
the animals are safe and there is no legal suicidal, self-determination that has been exploited by them and their locations.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust's official, encouraged the interior to leave us.

Ronaldo has denied allegations of rape and his agents will protest against the Jamanian bloodline
Cristiano Rolando called allegations of rape as false, saying that people want to be known by his name.
his representatives will file a German media press for Der Spiegel, which is the main reason for these allegations.
the Portugal and Juventus player allegedly raped an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, at the hotel in 2009
he said that he had paid <0x24>3<0x37>5,000 if he could pay for the damage, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
and spoke of Instagram that spread alive to 142 million fans in just a few hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, opposed it as "false."
"Don't just say, you're just, you're just.
"That's what you don't have to say, it's all right," the Ballon d'Or five winners say in the camera.
"He wants to know people by my name.
It's normal.
they want to be known by my name, but it's normal.
"I'm glad I'm happy," added the player, "I'm happy.
Ronaldo's attorneys say they are trying to denounce Der Spiegel on these allegations who have "disappeared the allegations of abuse of personal life," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz says the player wants "a spiritual injury due to human rights abuses in the past few years."
This event is said to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
then after meeting in a drinking place, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to go to the player's room, where he was raped behind, according to papers posted in the Clark County Court of Nevada.
The Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to the knees after the damage was accused of being a "good person" "99 percent" problem is a percentage of the other."
The pamphlets say Ronaldo to make sure the couple slept together, but they agreed.
"Mayorga says he went to the police and took photos of their injuries to the hospital, but he heard them agree to talk to each other outside the courts because he felt afraid that he would return and be worried about the trauma."
a 34-year-old man now wants to go back to their hands for what he says he makes Ronaldo suffer.
Ronaldo was still joining Real Madrid from Manchester United while this incident occurred, and this summer he went to a large group of Italy Juventus sold for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: The UK will 'forever regret' by losing automotive manufacturers
the UK will "forever regret" when it doesn't lose its ultimate position in the production of cars after Brexit, says press secretary Greg Clark.
he added that he was worried that Toyota in the UK told the BBC that Britain could travel to the EU over the debate would slow down to produce their day in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a link," said Mr. Clark.
the Japanese automobile manufacturer has said that the tendency to overhaul the output of goods is limited when no inconsistency in Brexit can complete the work.
Burnaston production <0xE2><0x80><0x93> producing Toyota Auris and Avensis <0xE2><0x80><0x93> produced approximately 150,000 cars last year that 90<0x25> of the channels were exported to the European Union.
"I think that if Britain goes to the EU when Mashi concludes, we will see the production stops from our invention," said Marvin Cooke, the director of Toyota in Burnaston.
some UK automobile manufacturers have expressed their fear of the EU's passage without a comparison by how they are trading together, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its production of Minutes in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
a serious concern about this can also lead to the risk of the transaction when there is no correlation in Brexit.
the Toyota production list is processed with the process of "time-time," with car goods arriving every 3<0x37> minutes from suppliers from the UK and the EU for the purpose of the cars being produced for purchase immediately.
even the UK goes to the EU without a unanimity at 29 March, there may be some confusion on the border where the business says it can be adversity and inexpensive clothing.
Toyota will never have goods that are jealous of the day of its Derbyshire production, say this industry, and the production will stand.
Mr Clark said Theresa May and the EU's program "was intended not to deal with this border inspection problem."
"We need a link. We need a very good combination that will allow us to take the opportunity," tells BBC Radio 4 in a conference called Today.
is "proof that not only originates from Toyota but also from other manufacturers explains that we need to continue where we were with a fully successful production."
Toyota hasn't emerged about how long the production is running, and when in the long term, warn that the rising prices will reduce the ability of the competition over time to complete the work.
Peter Tsoullavaris who has worked for Burnaston for 24 years and has been taking the Unite of this verse says it's about worrying again. "The time I spent I knew that when it goes this work will never come back"

Trump and Rosenstein's meeting can be rescheduled, and the U.S. president's office
of Donald Trump's most important meeting and general supporter Rod Rosenstein could be posted another week as the fight for the high-profile court election by Brett Kavanaugh continues, the president said.
Rosenstein focuses on the work of special conspirator Robert Mueller, who conducted investigations about the disruption of Russian elections, and an assembly between Trump's and Russia's colleagues and disrupting the legislative arm by the president
Trump's dismissal of another does not take the general representative, put him in danger of Mueller's autonomy, has been the cause of much publicity in Washington in the past months.
earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein meant that he will wear something that records a conversation with Trump and the possibility of removing the defender with a 25 amendment
Rosenstein denied the report.
but on the last day he went to the White House, among the reports that he would withdraw

Trump said he "did not choose" to dismiss Royentein but then the meeting was suspended to avoid conflict in the Senate of the Committee heating where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual immorality, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom testified.
on Friday, Tump has authorized a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, which has announced the Senate's full vote.

the question about the Rosenstein meeting, said: "The day that you haven't been used, or not this week, I saw that the rest of the week was given to all other events in the high court.
But we're going to see it and I always like to keep the press updated."
some scholars argue that the Sanders have not been running the White House line since September 10th.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of comments was not due to the disruption of "great" TV suppliers, although he said, "I will not agree with the fact that they look."
He suggested that you connect directly between Trump and the Express to boost.
the "President made <0x51><0x26>A sessions and sessions rather than any president before," he added without stating the evidence: "Let's look at those figures."
reports will happen, Sanders said, but "If the printer has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States more directly, it's better than talking to me.
we try to do it and have seen him do a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace the printing definition when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often takes questions when you leave the White House or take part in open sessions or combine conferences with the right sentences.
Solidarity news conferences are tragic.
in New York this week the president may have indicated why he made freewheeling and occasionally invisible before meeting the media.

Mr Park has said that cross-border control is bordered between North Korea and China and the high levels paid by the suppliers of the main material.
Pyongyang did not create human views.
Most of the victims of the North are eventually given to the South Korean population.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Korean Americans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
the majority of them fled China, the longest in North Korea and it is easy to cross beyond the Dilitised Zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.

Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "a triangle," saying he is not ready to serve in the Supreme Court.
a young House leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court highman Brett Kavanaugh as "a triangle" and said that he was not eligible to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made answers to Saturday's discussion at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but I think if a woman has ever done that way, they would say to us that they would be 'investigating,' Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh evidence in front of the Court Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was legally allowed to smoke sex in Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
at the time of opening, Kavanaugh had a lot of feelings, sometimes he would cry and mix when he talked about his family and his high school years.
he had clearly judged democracies in the committee, calling the cities for him a "combined link and man's coordination" organised by rare institutions that Hillary Clinton lost the 201<0x36> national election.
Pelosi said he believed in Kavanaugh's evidence that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was being abused by Democrats.
"I think he's ready for those explanations and how the Clintons and Democrats follow," he said.
Pelosi was stressed when asked if he would try to interfere with Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats are gaining a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to mean this - if he doesn't speak the truth in Congress or the FBI, then he doesn't deserve to be a Supreme Court, but to be in court on the scene," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democracy he was concerned about the sentencing of the Kavanaugh Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is regarded as a sustainable justice.
in his confirmation of imprisonment, Kavanaugh answered questions about whether he could modify certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
