How much more or less do you have these symptoms?
and always the pain of skin must be treated in this way, in particular to its age
and also fibre
and should also be controlled by colesterol and arterial pressure
And you've got fiber now?
And do you feel this pain of skin now?
and has also difficult to breathe
And can you tell me what other symptoms have more than this?
and how much he had fever
and I've also got tos
And I have a little relaxed and tos.
And today I have a very strong pain of skin
And this is the time given for its allergie to the pool
and the pain of skin appears
And I think I have a little fever.
And I want to describe where I feel the pain of skin
And they're having something of fever too
and with its preceding of diabetes
And you know, I feel like the skin is struck me
And you know, people touch me over all the time
and feels pain of skin
And said it's a pressure in the skin
Someone of the family has a heart problem, heart disease, heart attack, colesterol high, high blood pressure
Is there any other symptom or problem that notes beyond muscle pain?
Is there any other sick people like you with the same symptoms in your home?
Do you have any other symptom?
Do you have something out of air?
I still feel pain in the skin
Because this is the time of grip
But they should also not ignore us by the pain of the pain of the heart of the skin of the heart.
But now a more important problem is this pain of skin
But I have difficult to breathe
But I know that many people touch me above
But we always have to handle skin pain with the maximum seriousness
But now you're breathing well, right?
for this pain of skin I forgot completely
it feels like somebody's gonna destroy you.
You still feel as a lack of air
Do you want to be sick with similar symptoms?
Does any other chronic disease, such as high blood pressure or something like that?
Do you have another disease, chronic medical problem, such as diabetes?
Do you have something lacking of air in addition to skin pain?
Do you have high blood pressure?
Do you have some episodes of lack of air with that?
Did you know what symptoms?
See the picture?
drink very liquid today
but I do tests for diabetes
However, it has very similar symptoms to mys
How much fever has?
How is your arterial pressure?
if it continues to have high fever
if there is a hundred fever of the levels or higher
if you believe that your symptoms or problems justify a better review
I gave me fever yesterday
I also had a little fever
I've got fever yesterday
I've got a pain here, in the skin
I've also got something difficult to breathe
I'll send you a image
I've got a bit of pearl pain today
Today I've just got a little head pain and something of fever.
in my opinion, it's a grip
in my opinion, it's a little grip
Is it like somebody very, very weak sit on his skin?
all started with head pain and fever more or less at the same time
I'll sweat the center of the skin
is a pressure as the pain of skin
is in my skin
It's in the center of my skin
is in the center of the skin
I'm sorry in the skin
I'm so worried about this pain of skin
I want to tell me how this pain of skin describes
as high or diabetes arterial pressure
as just in the center of the skin
You can now take a Tachipirina tablet for fever
Now, Mary, how many days ago has the symptoms
Now he said he had a pain of skin.
On the other hand, I have a bit of skin pain.
Well, you have some other symptom beyond this, which is not only the pain.
Or somebody sit on his skin?
Basically similar, with fever and tones, head pain and muscle pain
just in the center of the skin
Show me in this image where it feels pain
since it has fever
So do you think some of these symptoms may be related to pregnancy?
So your children have some of the same symptoms?
Ask me about his skin pain
the fever is higher for the night
the fever that had the last two days
the fever began to be higher night
this is the doctor Porter in the triage center of the emergency room
Well, can you tell me a little more about your skin pain?
Well, I'm feeling a pain in the next part of the body, here in the skin.
Well, I'm feeling a strong pain in the skin.
Well, when I have that pain in my skin
What kind of pain you're in the skin?
When did this pain begin in the skin?
Where do you feel pain in your skin?
{NS}
feeling as a pressure in the skin
You know I have diabetes and others.
He said he feeled this pain of skin.
Currently accumulated incidences of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The accumulated incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, although in different phases according to the country, COVID-19 pandemia is rapidly progressing in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for an COVID-19 patients who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerated cases of unknown ethiology neumony was reported in Whan, Province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Control and Prevention of Nurse reported that the caused agent was a new coronavirus that now known as a serious respiratory syndrome 2 of the serious respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence at the date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a weak disease, i.e., a respiratory treatment infection with or without neumony, and that most of them are recovery.
In 14% of the cases, COVID-19 evolves to a more serious disease that requires hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of the cases develop a critical disease that require intensive care.
The mortality in patients hospitalized by COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine the trends in the accumulated COVID-19 incidences in each countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EEE) and the United Kingdom (RU) and compare them with those of the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current amount of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the RU of Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the RU
After China, COVID-19 continued geographically promoting and the dynamic of COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently remains the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic.
In the edition of 5 March 2020, Spiter et al. was informed about the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with the definition of WHO case.
In the EU/EEE, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020, in people returned from Whan, the province of Hubei, China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in the 30 EU/EEE and the United Kingdom (RU), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that inclusive date were registered 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths, with 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths in Italy only.
Obtaining the accumulated amount and accumulated incidence of cases of COVID-19
In the European Headquarters for Control and Diseases Prevention (ECDC), case accounts of COVID-19 reported in each world, only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of Countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO are updated every day at 8:00 p.m.
These data were used to examine COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the RU and to compare it with Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of the active cases of COVID-19, we calculate the accumulated incident of cases of COVID-19 tranched to 14 days; so we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEE country and RU, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the amount of cases reported in each country to 15 March 2020, at 8:00 p.m., compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 tendencies in the EU/EEA countries and the RU
In the EU/EEA countries and the RU, in general, followed the province of Hubei (Chine) to 14 days.
In the EU/EEA and the RU in general, the accumulated COVID-19 incident began to increase around 21 February and then significantly increased around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly the rapid increase in Italy's reported cases, but all other countries of the EU/EEA and the RU showed tendencies from the accumulated COVID-19 compared (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulated amount of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the RU, compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
He stressed that, on March 15, at 8:00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the RU had already registered a total number of cases comparable to Italy only three weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of informed COVID-19 cases are rapidly increased in the EU/EEA and the RU.
The trends observed in the accumulated incidence of COVID-19 suggest that pandemic is progressing in a similar rhythm in all countries.
This is thus despite the different stages in which countries are found, the variations in national health responses and, perhaps, the different definitions in countries and protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including the late tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, the doctors of Italy's affected regions described a situation where 10 per cent of the patients with COVID-19 requested intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of cases of COVID-19 in a hospital or an intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of the cases, respectively (not data shown).
However, systemically should be collected to complement the current monitoring data focused on the quantity of informed cases and the amount of death.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed a great variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care in Europe, which was 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds every 1000,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and intermediate care in 2010-11).
Model scenarios relating to the saturation of medical care capacity, calculating for each EU/EEA countries and the RU of the prevalence of COVID--19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk >90% supervision of intensive care capacities, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid risk evaluation of the ECDC on COVID-19.
Since cases have been consolidated in certain regions of the EU/EEA countries and the RU, and hospitals and intensive care units normally attend to a defined regional capture population, the information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be available at the level of the designation of statistical territorial units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and the current trends in other countries show that COVID-19 pandemics are rapidly progressing in EU/EEA and RU.
CoV-2 countries, hospitals and intensive care units should, however, be prepared for a sustained Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 that require medical care, and in particular intensive care, such as in the regions affected by Italy.
As indicated in the rapid risk assessment of the ECDC, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and integral approach to delay the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not give them sufficient time to the decisions and hospitals responsible for understanding, accepting and adapting their response in a way agreed if it is not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of pandemia.
There is a short period of opportunities during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to strike the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, it is likely that health systems from other EU/EEA countries are affected by patients who need intensive care in the next days and weeks.
The illness brothing by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), until the time caused the death of 3000 people and infected more than 800,000 in China and other parts of the world, which generated a disaster for humans.
Like his Homolog Virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the murcilage and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a less serious and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and more affected by the older people than younger and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emergency disease, the purpose of this article is to provide an appropriate and complete analysis of the research topic which is quickly developed.
We will treat the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
Although many questions have not yet been answered, we hope that this analysis will help understand and eliminate this threatening disease.
The spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an inaugurable and unforeseen memory for all Chineses, who were urged them to stay home during the whole festival and for a few weeks more because of the breast of a new viral disease.
The virus is almost the same name as the coronavirus (COV) caused a severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called SARS-COV-2, and associated disease was named by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Whan, China, and was rapidly proclaimed throughout the country and almost 50 countries more than all over the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80 000 cases confirmed by COVID-19, with more than 40 000 patients with high data and more than 3000 failed patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (http://www.cmbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19, including their virus, epidemiology, ethics, diagnostics and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the follow-up of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The objective of this analysis is to resume progress in research on this new matter that is quickly developed.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, a brote in 2012).
We will also consider what is known until the moment of prevention and prognosis of disease, as well as some decisive questions that have not yet been answered.
Traditionally coronavirus has been considered non-legal pathogens for humans, which primarily caused around 15% of common refrigerators 4.
However, in this century, we have found two times with high pathogens in humans, i.e. the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused a brote in China, 2003, and Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with a spontaneous mortality and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID brochure is the third by coronavirus that has been registered in the history of mankind.
As shown in Figure 1,1, Unknown neumony conglomers were first informed by Whan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, he was known the sequence of the coronavirus.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was registered in Whan.
While the epidemic was soon proclaimed rapidly to the cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medical care providers was informed, as suggested that human transmission could be possible.
On January 23, the city of Whan was placed in quarter and all public transport was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, in the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had been directly contacted with the Whan's marine market that was considered the source site of the infection of an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared a global health emergency to the broth.
At the date of this report, disease has already been propagated throughout China and almost 50 countries more than all over the world (fig. 2).
Since the situation evolves rapidly, the dimension and final severity of the breast can not yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentric study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with COVID-19 confirmed, presented a more updated illustration of epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHHP1Q2bhA).
SARS-CoV-2 was infected to people of all ages, but primarily to people from 30 to 65 years of age.
About half (47.7%) of infected people had over 50 years, very few of them had less than 20 and only 14 infections were less than 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 was infected by men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was expanded in most conglomerated in Hubei and its surroundings.
In the meantime, 5 days (of 2 to 9) were between the appearance and the diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (inter 3,0 to 7,2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days (inter 4,8 to 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (IC 95%: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, which corresponds to the time of massive mobilization before the Primary Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1,44% (95% IC: 1,10-1,86%) and the adjusted mortality of patients was 3,06% (95% IC: 2,02-4,59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (man), age (≥60) and serious neumony.
The coronavirus is a subfamily of large and involuntary virus containing a single sense ARN.
They can divide in four kinds, i.e. alpha, beta, gama and delta, of which the alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are those who infect humans.
Spiga glucoprotein (S) of the involvement is one of its cellal receptors, angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and peptidel dipeptidea 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then the fusion of membranes is produced.
The viral ARN genome is released to plasma cycling; after the replication of the viral genome, the genetic ARN, together with the glucoproteins of the envolture and the proteins of the nucleocapside, a vesicle form that contains viruses, which then be fusioned with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
The SARS-CoV-2 was found that the new type of betacoronavirus was a new type of genetic identity more than 99.98% in 10 sequent samples taken from the original brood site: the Huanan marine market of Whan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particules were found in human respiratory epidemic sections.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a SARS-CoV-2 receptive and SARS-CoV.
However, protein S from SARS-CoV-2 is one of the more weakest human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b orf3b could have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNs; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or reason.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., the structure of electronic chromoscopic of the ACE2 human length in resolution 2.9, complex with the B0AT1 transporter amino acid.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed compliance, was assembled as a dimery, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can join two S proteins, which gives evidence for recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could be converted into a therapeutic dialysis for the medicine study to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Heritage and intermediate hostage
SARS-CoV and MERS-COV were originated in murcileals and were transmitted to humans through clouds and chambers respectively.
In a philosogenetic comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, it was considered that the murcielago is the native host of the SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is identical in 96 % to two similar coronavirus to the SARS of murcilelages called ba-SL-CoVX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
Nevertheless, what intermediate hosped helped the virus to cross the barrier of the species to infect humans, and remains dissolved the path of transmission.
Ji, et al., I proposed the serpients as the portators of the virus of murcilelates to humans, which implies homologue recombination within the Protein S.
According to a study, Guangzhou (Chine) researchers suggested that pangolines (length hocic mamiferos that are food of hormones and which are often used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate SARS-CoV-2 host based on a genetic homology of 99% in a discovered coronavirus in pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% distributed by the totality of two genomes remains a great difference; however, it is expected to be concluded that concrete evidence (figure 33).
The physical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive in vitro 48 hours in a sewage environment and up to 5 days less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultravioleta and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, etanol to 75%, a desinfectant with clore, prochloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not clorhexidine, are effective to disable virus.
All human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and, however, is likely to be the new coronavirus.
Until the time, no detailed study on immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Consequently, we can only recurr to previous studies with other coronavirus, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4).
Generally, after the virus invades the guest, it is first recognised by the host’s immune immune system through the pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including the C-type recycling receptors, the type Toll (TLR), the NOD (NLR) receptor type (NLR) and RIG-I (RLR).
Through different ways, the virus introduces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maduration of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I (IFN) interferences that limit the propagation of the virus and accelerate macrophazic fagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N can help virus to escape immune responses.
All right, the adjustable immune response is summarised to the fight against virus.
T Linfocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, meet a significant role in defence.
The CD4+ cells stimulate the B cells to produce specific antibodies for virus, and CD8+ cells directly kill the virus infected cells.
Co-operator T cells produce proinflammatory cytocins to help defence cells.
However, the coronavirus may inhibit T cell functions by inducing the pharmaceuticals of T cells.
Humor immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovery patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exagerate reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free roots that can cause serious damage to pulmones and other bodies, and in the worst cases, multi-organic failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance in conglomerates, has more likely to affect older people with competitiveness and pregnant women.
It is common that people who are exposed to a large number of virus or whose immune functions are compromised have more likely to be infected than others.
The average estimated SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is from 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Whan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days in average and heavy from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as previously described, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (inter3.0 to 7.2) based on the demography of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the effective time of quarennium on the basis of the more accurate incubation period; this will prevent asthmatical persons to transmit the virus to others.
As normal practice, people exposed to virus or infected should remain in quarenday for 14 days.
Should the quarter be extended at 24 days?
The fever is usually the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by any other symptoms or other symptoms such as sweet, disnee, muscle pain, marry, head pain, gurgante pain, skin pain, diarree, nausea, and vomite.
Some patients had disner or hypoxemia a week after the appearance of the disease.
In serious cases, patients evolved rapidly until developing acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabological acid and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary anomalies in image studies, should be tested for an early diagnosis.
A demographic study of the end of December 2019 indicated that the percentage of the symptoms was 98 per cent for fever, 76 per cent for settle tube, 55 per cent for diarrhoea and 3 per cent; 8 per cent of patients require respiratory assistance.
Similar places were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerated and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of a asthmatic person.
A demographic study in 2012 showed that the patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry tox (47 per cent) and disnee (55 per cent) as major symptoms.
However, 80 per cent of them requested respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the greatest letality of MERS in relation to COVID-19.
Diarrey (26%) and gargant pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, fever (99-100%) was demonstrated that sewage tube (29-75%), disney (40-42%), diarree (20-25%) and gargant pain (13-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance needed by approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
For 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2 per cent when confirmed cases reached 66.576 throughout the world.
Similarly, SARS’s mortality for November 2002 was 10% in 8096 cases confirmed.
For MRS, in accordance with a democratic study of June 2012, mortality was 37 % in 2494 cases confirmed.
In a previous study, R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was high and was up to 6.47 with a trust (IC) range of 95% from 5,71 to 7,23, while the R0 of the SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparation of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV on symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The previous figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater dissemination capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its letality is less than the one of these two lasts.
It is therefore much more difficult to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerated conglomers usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, as a cruise.
Patients often have travel or residence in Whan and other areas affected or contacted with infected persons or patients in the two weeks before appearance.
However, humans have been informed that they can bring the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that hospital high data can return to the virus, alarm signal that the time of the quarentine should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white bleeding in peripheral blood (especially linfocitos) in early stage.
For example, linfopenia was observed with a white bleeding container of <4x109/l, including a linfocytes container of <1x109/l, and high levels of aminotransferated aspartate in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The hepatic and muscular enzymes and myoglobin were high in the blood of certain patients, and protein C reactivated and erythrocytic sedimentation were higher in the blood of most patients.
In patients with serious cases, the level of dimere-D, a product of the degradation of fibrine present in the blood, was high, and the linfocytes account was progressively reduced.
Annomalities are detected in the toracic radiographies of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shadows or bilateral vision opacity in pulmones.
Patients are often developing atypical neumony, a slightly pulmonary leakage and a cold respiratory syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA is produced, uncontrolled inflamation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis are seriously affected by gas exchange.
The disfunction of type I and type II is decreasing the level of surfacting and increased superficial pressure, which reduces the ability of pulmonary failure to increase and increase the risk of pulmonary failure.
Consequently, the worst findings in toracic radiographies are often in parallel with the maximum gravity of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first patoological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the disappearance of neumocits, the training of a hialin membrane and the infiltration of linfocides in the interstition, and multi-nucleated synthical cells in patients who died because of the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of viral and SDRA infection, and similar to patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 ARN was used as the main criteria for COVID diagnosis (19.
However, because of the high negative rates that could accelerate epidemic, clinical manifestations were started to be used for diagnosis (which was not yet based only on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the SARS diagnosis.
Consequently, a combination of illness, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radioological findings is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described an application protocol of SERLOCK technique based on CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 to 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per sample microlitro) using a graduated variant in less than one hour that does not require complex instruments.
With luck, the new technique can drasticly increase sensitivity and conviction if checking in clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors may mostly provide support to patients with COVID-19 while testing with a variety of treatments that have been used or proposed before the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapy includes current or potential treatments with antiviral medicines, immunosupresor, steroids, plasma of recovery patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It is proposed to use the plasma of recovery patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are working to see who first develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the pulmones to the principle and probably also, at a lower level, other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the digestive device and the renals.
However, disfunction and respiratory insufficient are the largest threat for patients and the main cause of death.
As a result, respiratory assistance is critical to eliminate symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation in accordance with disease gravity.
Patients with serious respiratory symptoms need extracorporate membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique that is used for the treatment of cardiac or potentially mortal respiratory insufficients.
In addition, the maintenance of electronic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary and septic shock infections, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that cytocin torment is the result of an exagerate reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytocin torment is a form of systematic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytocins, including TNFAL, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFNAL, IFNś, IFNγ, MCP-1.
These cytokines lead to immune cells to release a huge number of free roots that are the main cause of SDRA and multi-organic failure.
Immunouspression is essential for the treatment of cytokine torment, especially in serious patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 monoclonal antireceptor antibodies, have been used to treat cytokin torment.
Other immune treatments for cytokine torment are the modulation of the immune response leading to T cells; IFN- Gamma block, IL-1 and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; an overview of 4 cytokin signalization, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosupresors, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce inflammatory damage.
However, steroids in high doses were not benefited for serious pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they may cause serious secondary effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which affects prognosis notably.
However, the careful use of corticosteroids was recommended in low-dose moderates during a short period for patients with COVID-19 in critical state.
At the date of this analysis the effectiveness of any antiviral therapy was confirmed.
However, the effectiveness of remdesivir, a nucleotic analysis, was tested in intravenous way in a US patient with COVID-19.
remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg.
Afterwards, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other viruses with monocatenary ARN, such as MERS and SARS virus.
On the basis of these, Gilead has provided the composition to China to make a couple of tests in infected people with SARS-CoV-2, and there is a great expectation for the results.
Furthermore, baricitinib, alfa interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarea, nausea, injuries, hepatic damage and other adverse reactions can be produced after the combinated treatment with lopinavir/ ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully controlled.
plasma of recovered patients and generation of antibodies
The extraction of blood from patients that have been recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who have contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not interfere with disease is not something new.
In fact, recovery patients are usually relatively high levels of antibodies against the pathogen in blood.
Anticorps are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B linfocytes to combat pathogens and other strange objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogènes and direct neutralize them.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from a group of patients recovery of COVID-19 and was injected to 10 serious sick patients.
His symptoms improved in 24 hours, along with inflamation reduction and viral loads and better oxygen saturation.
However, it is necessary to check and clarify this to propose the method for its use at a large scale until specific treatments are developed.
In addition, data of the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated devenge should be considered detentively.
For example, antibodies can stimulate the immune response and cause the syndrome of liberation of cytocins, which may cause mortal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in blood is normally low, and the plasma demand is high to treat patients in critical state.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to fight global pandemia.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate the B cells of the recovery patients and to identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or search for effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, their effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that would be in accordance with the diagnosis of a disease in accordance with MCT theories.
Most effective components are still unknown or implicit, since it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
At present, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with leak to moderate symptoms or for those who have been recovery of serious stages.
For example, the capsules of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen's capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China that used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hungary (50%), while Hubei province, which used MCT in about 30% of their patients with COVID-19, had the lower recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a quite approached comparison, since many other effect factors, such as quantity and gravity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study compared to the western medicine (MO) only with the combinated MO and MCT treatment.
They found that the necessary time for recovery of body temperature, symptoms and hospitalization disappearance was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group only in the MO group.
What is more surprising, the deterioration rate of symptoms (the weight to serious) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4% against 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% against 39%).
However, the efficiency and safety of the CTM continue to wait for more well-controlled tests at larger levels and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the action mechanism and to determine the effective components of MCT treatments or their combinations as possible.
Patients with suspicious or confirmion of COVID-19 generally have a lot of fear of very contagious and even mortal disease, and people in quarenten also experience abuse, solitude and angry.
In addition, the symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and tos, as well as the adverse effects of treatment, such as corticosteroids, may cause more anxiety and mental anxiety.
In the early phase of the SARS breast, a series of psychiatric moratives, including them, persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotropical excitation, psychotic symptoms, delirio and even suicide trends were reported.
The raster of contacts and the quarter binding, as part of the public health responses to the COVID brochure, can make people feel more nervous and guilty for the effects of county, quarennium and estigm in their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health should be given attention to patients with COVID-19, people with suspicion and persons who are in contact with them, as well as the general public you need.
Psychoological support should include training of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and precise updates on SARS-CoV-2 breast, and treatment plans and use of professional devices and applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the transmission chain of animal and human reserves infected to potential hospitals, and often supplementing antiviral treatment in the control of emergency viruses.
Develop vaccines based on protein S to generate powerful neutralizing antibodies and long-term or immunity protected against SARS-CoV.
Vacuns have been evaluated with living viruss in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivon effectiveness of these possible vaccines in older people and letal stimulation models and their protection against the infection of zoonotic origin virus should still be determined before a clinical study is started.
This is likely that SARS had been extended 17 years ago and no new case has been registered since then.
Instead, there are still cases and conglomers of MERS in the Middle East that are spread to other regions because of the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
MERS vaccination strategies have been developed using disabled virus, DNA plasmed, virus vectors, nanopartical vectors, similar viruses and recombinating protein subunities, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the current pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties because of the long period (18 months in average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of the coronavirus.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently started to demonstrate its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can be gradually recovered without secules.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morality and mortality in patients with serious cases.
The creation of a prognostic model for disease is therefore essential to enable health agencies to priorize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies until now, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
age: age was the most important factor for the SARS prognostic, which also results accurate for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was increased in people from 30 to 65 years and 47.7 per cent of those patients had more than 50 years in a study of 8866 cases, as previously described.
Patients who requested intensive care more likely had substantive competitives and complications and were significantly higher than those who did not require them (more of 66 to 51), which suggested that age is a prognostic factor of the development of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more male than women (0.31/100 000 before 0.27/100 000), as previously described.
Compatibility and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care with more likelihood are suffering from augmented and arthic heart lesson.
The heart events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be associated with positive ACE2 colangiocytes, which may cause hepatic disfunctions in patients with COVID-19.
It is noted that age and substantive diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere between themselves.
Anormal laboratory results: the level of reactive C protein (PCR) in blood reflects the gravity of inflamation or the leakage of the tissues and has been proposed as a possible factor of prognostic for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
Furthermore, the correlation between the GDP level and the seriousness and the prognosis of COVID-19 was proposed.
Furthermore, a high level of dehydrogenase lactate (LDH), aminotransfera (AST), aminotransferous alanin (ALT) and Chinese creatine (CK) can also help to predict the patient’s evolution.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in several organs, especially the heart and heat, and are released when the tissue is damaged.
Indeed, they are traditional characters of cardiac or hepatic disfunctions.
Main clinical symptoms: torax radiography and temporary progress of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other symptoms for preventing clinical delays and COVID complications.
The use of steroids: as previously described, steroids are immune who are commonly used as adjuvante treatment for infected diseases in order to reduce inflammatory damage gravity.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids was extended in patients with serious SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent and bad life quality.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low dose and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stresses: As previously described, during the COVID breast, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as generally, have suffered long periods in quarennium and extreme uncertainty, and attended the death of neighbors and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal life.
According to demographic studies until now, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics than the SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory ways, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively replicated in higher respiratory ways and causes light symptoms or not symptoms in the early infection phase, as happens with other coronavirus that cause common refrigerators.
Consequently, patients infected in early or incubating periods may produce a large number of virus during their daily activities, which is very difficult to control epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV would occur when patients were seriously sick, while mostly transmission would not occur in the early phase.
Indeed, the current COVID brown is much more serious and difficult to control than SARS's breast.
Great efforts are made at the time in China, including the Whan's closer and the cities of the surrounding and the continuing population of almost all with the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures are generating a significant damage in the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is reduced, which indicates the deterioration of epidemic.
According to the most optimistic prediction, the bret will be concluded for March and the descendant phase will take 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, and al., suggested that COVID-19, which seems to be significantly infected than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, and al., created a model for predicting epidemic evolution and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could be infected to two thirds of the world population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was identified as native and pharmagins in patients who had been recovered and left the hospital two weeks ago, which indicated that recently identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to the influenza.
However, promising signs have been observed in China as a result of the reduction in the number of new cases, which indicates that the current strategies could work.
It was originally predicted that ebola would cause up to a million cases with a half million deaths.
However, through a quarter and strict isolation, illness has been controlled.
It is possible that, as SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is weak as infectious terms and finally is extensive or become a less pathogenic virus that is associated with humans.
A comparison of COVID-19 epidemia with SARS and MERS is following (f. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible via tube or extracts, and may also be through direct contact with virus contaminated materials.
The virus was also detected in the fats, which presents a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were possiblely caused by nosocomoous infections, including 17 patients with other pre-ill diseases and 40 medical care providers.
Therefore, care should be taken to protect humans, especially medical care providers, social workers, family workers, colleagues and, including, transneemers in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first defence line that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of maskers; the use of chirurgic maskers and maskers with N95 respirator (serial number 1860) helps to control virus propagation.
Surgical maskers impede that liquid skins of a potentially infected person are transmitted by the air or adherent to the surfaces, from which they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only the N95 maskers (serial number 1860) may protect against the inhalation of virals as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virus can cut them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both halfs around 85 nm.
Since particules can spend up to five sliced surgical maskers, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 maskers (serial number 1860) and not chirurgic maskers.
In addition to mass, medical care providers should use isolation bands in order to reduce the contact with viruses.
Virus can also infection a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, despite using a N95 masker; it is possible that the virus has invaded his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, medical care providers should also use protective or transparent career while working with patients.
For the public in general of affected or potentially affected areas, it is suggested that the population is laid down the hands with the most defects of the habit, trying to stay home in voluntary quarter and limit the contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet are considered a suitable distance for people to keep away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods for reducing the risk of infection and preventing virus propagation.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused great warning in China for his experience with SARS breast in 2003.
Nevertheless, until 19 January 2020, the Director of the Whan's Headquarters' Control Center was quiet to citizens, saying that the new virus had a low contagious and limited reproduction capacity, and that there would be no problem to prevent and contain disease.
This message noted significantly the warning of the public, especially at a time when the whole country was prepared for the Spring Festival, and the critical moment was disappointed to contain the disease at the minimum level in Whan.
The Chinese disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when making public advertisements, since every word is important for citizens and can change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactivable to clinical information, instead of waiting for formal medical or official reports; (3) more restrictive to contain possible epidemics in their early phase, instead of trying to tranquilize the public; and (4) more regularly in implementing adapted and effective simultaneous simulations in order to increase the consciousness of the public about epidemic diseases and to test and to improve the reaction system of society regularly.
The COVID brote caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, all China and some 50 countries more than the world have been distributed at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between COVID-19 and SARS symptoms, COVID-19 bread has generated the feeling of reapparition of SARS.
However, there are some notoric differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain epidemic and to treat patients.
COVID-19 affects young people more than young people than women, and gravity and mortality are also more than young people.
SARS has more mortality than COVID-19 (10,91%).
Patients with COVID-19 are transmising the virus even though they do not present symptoms, while patients with SARS generally do it when seriously sick, which generates a higher difficulty to contain the propagation of COVID-19 in comparison with SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 was so faster and generalized than SARS-CoV.
The regular ARN test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, treatment may be positive in the virus again.
These results are dramatically increased the risk of propaging virus.
In view of the so fast progress in the research of COVID-19, a number of important issues remains to be addressed as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 go?
Although 96 per cent of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS muscles coronavirus, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates.
What animal was the medium species that transmitted the virus of the original guest, say, the murderers, the humans?
Without the answers to number 1 and 2, the transmission is not efficiently possible, and the brown can be resurrected at any time.
While molecular modelled and biochemical tests have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is one of the ACE2, how is the virus exactly entering the respiratory cells and causes post-patoological changes?
Is virus also one of the cells expressing the ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a fast and necessary diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic?
How does the virus genetically evolve while transmission between humans?
Will it become a world pandemic, will it be extended as SARS or will it periodically resurrected as the grip?
Although you can take some time, it is essential to search for answers to these questions and to many others.
However, you care what you care, we have no more option than stopping epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Sonotic origins of human coronavirus
Change and adjustment have stimulated the coevolution of the coronavirus and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
To 2003, two human coronavirus were known to cause mild diseases, such as common refrigerator.
The severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS) have inverted the currency when discovering how devastating and mortal can be a human coronavirus infection.
The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 put the coronavirus again in the care centre and surprised us with a high transmissibility and a reduced pathogenicity compared to his brother, the SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and would be useful to know the zoonotic origins of the human coronavirus.
Most human coronavirus have their origin in the musulmans, in which they are not pathogens.
The intermediate reserve hosts of some human coronavirus are also known.
The identification of animal hospitals has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Research of interactions between coronavirus and heatings in animals could also provide significant information on the pathogeny of the coronavirus in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge of the seven human coronavirus, with emphasis in the history of their discovery, as well as in its zoonotic origins and in the transmission between species.
Of course, we compare and contrast human different coronavirus from the perspective of the virus evolution and the recombination of the genome.
The current epidemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease is analyzed in this context.
Furthermore, the requirements for the change in hosts and the implications of virus evolution in the seriousness of disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a positive monocatenary ARN virus group with envolving.
These viruses, which have the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kg, among the ARN viruses, were called "coronavirus" because of their morphology, in the form of coron that have under an electronic microscope.
As regards its structure, the coronavirus has non-selected genomes that share similar organizations.
Nearly two thirds of the genome include two major open reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the replicated polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Poliproteines are still more processed to generate 16 proteins in structures, called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spiga (S), of the envolture (E), of the membrane (M) and the nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific accessive proteins of each line are also encoded by different coronavirus lines.
Based on the difference in the sequences of protein, the coronavirus is classified in four genders (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacroronavirus and deltacoronavirus), including the gender of betacoronavirus, and subdivided in four languages (A, B, C and D).
The philosogenetic evidence has demonstrated that the murcilels and rokers are the source of genes of most of the alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while the birds are the main reservation of the gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
Thousands of years, the coronavirus have constantly crossed the species' barriers, and some have occurred as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronavirus are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alfacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronavirus are HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, coronavirus of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), a coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 are normally caused light symptoms such as a common or diarree refrigerator.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause serious infections of the lower respiratory ways in relatively higher quantity of patients, with the increased probability of developing the acute respiratory syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulsion manifestations.
The first chep of HCOV-229E, B814, was isolated from the birth secretation of patients with common refrigeration in the middle of the 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through exhaustive studies on HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, which cause auto-limited symptoms.
In fact, even the SARS breast, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is generally inoffensive.
The SARS brote that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastators of the current history and infected more than 8000 people, with a crude letality of around 10 percent.
Ten years later, the breathing respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS) placed a persistent epidemic in the Arab Peninsula with sparative propagation to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus of 2019 (2019-nCOV), who later was called SARS-CoV-2, is the prominent agent of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which has been covered more than 3120 lives and infected by more than 91,000 people on 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronavirus have a zoonotic origin in muscles, ratons or domestic animals.
Several evidence lines support the evolutionary origin of all human colonies in murcileals, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but present great genetic diversity.
The epidemic of COVID-19 has posed huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Strengthe the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the impulsor force and the factors of salt restriction between species.
This could also lead or facilitate the search of the reservation and intermediate animals and amplificators of the SARS-CoV-2, which would have significant implications in the prevention of propagation in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogeny of human coronavirus.
In particular, we emphasize and analyze the common topic that parental viruss of human coronavirus are normally not pathogens in their natural reserve hosts, but that they become pathogens after transmission between species to a new host.
We also review the trend of human coronavirus evolution, in which the increased transmissibility is generally to facilitate the reduction of pathogenicity.
The development of the current SARS-CoV-2 brote is also analyzed in this context.
There is a knowledge of animal coronavirus since the end of the 1930s.
Before the first time the B814 skin of HCOV-229E of the birth secretation of patients who had affected a common refrigeration, different coronavirus had been isolated in different infected animals such as floor, mouse, vacuum, skin, and dog.
In the past decades, seven human coronavirus were identified.
A short summary of the history of human coronavirus discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be information and instructional.
HCOV-229E was isolated from the respiratory ways of patients with higher respiratory ways in 1966 and then adjusted to grow in WI-38 cellular lines of the pulmone.
Patients infected with HCOV-229E presented symptoms of common refrigerator, such as head pain, shocked, general pain and gargant pain, with fever and tones in 10~20% of the cases.
Later, in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and the after-serial path in milk raton cerebral.
The clinical features of HCOV-OC43 infection seem to be similar to those caused by HCOV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza virus A and rinovirus.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are distributed by the world and are intended to be forwarded predominantly during the winter station, in temple climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a illness period of around 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCOV-229E developed a light-friendy.
Only some immuno-committed patients presented a serious infection of lower respiratory ways.
SARS, also known as "atypical neumony", occurred the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in the history of mankind, and the ethnic agent is the SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus who was discovered.
The first case of SARS is retired to the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China.
SARS's epidemic resulted in 8096 cases reported with 774 deaths and was promulgated by many countries and continents.
In addition to superproductors, it was estimated that each case could occur about two secondary cases, with a incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of the maximum viral load of the 10th day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present mialgia, head pain, fever, general malaria and scalofree, followed by disnee, tones and breathing difficulty as late symptoms.
Linfopenia, modified hepatic function and high levels of chinasa creatine are common anormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Disfunctional damage, proliferation of epidemial cells and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
About 20-30% of patients later require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory ways, several organs, including gastrointestinal tube, hepatitis and renal, can also be infected in these serious cases, normally accompanied by a cytocin torment, which could be mortal, especially in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was isolated by the first time of the pulmonary biopsy of the first patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been dedicated to the investigation of human coronavirus.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a child of 7 months from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevailing in small children, adults and immuno-committed patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of corea, conjungitis, fever and bronquiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus of a nasal sample taken from a 8-month child suffering of neumony in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed by the world.
HCOV-NL63 has been estimated that about 4.7 per cent of common respiratory diseases are caused, and its maximum incidence occurs at the beginning of the summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laringite, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with neumony and bronquiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to neumony and bronquiolitis acquired in the community, it was reported that HCOV-HKU1 was associated with acute asylum exacerbations.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 was worldwide and caused light respiratory diseases.
These four human coronaviers acquired in the community have been adapted well to humans and, in general, are less likely to change to the cause of high pathogenic diseases, although there were accidents because of unknown causes, such as in the shorter case of a more viral subtype of HCOV-NL63, which recently reported that serious infection of the lower respiratory ways in China has been caused.
In general, when these human coronaviers purchase the ability to be effectively transmitted and maintained in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was isolated for the first time in 2012 by a patient’s 60-year-old pulmone that had developed awesome neumony and renal inadequate in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the laboratory are originating in the Middle East, cases have been imported with timely contact to close contacts in several European and Tunisia countries.
Another secondary brown occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases confirmed.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are compared to the SARS, characterized by augmentable neumony.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed awesome renal insufficiency, which is only given with MERS between human coronavirus diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrey and vomite.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases confirmed in the laboratory, with a high letality of 34.4 per cent, which converted to MERS-CoV as one of the most devastating viruses for humans that are known.
From average to the end of December 2019, conglomerated patients with neumony in Whan, Province of Hubei, China, which retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the current breast infection of lower respiratory ways caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and also named COVID-19 disease.
On 3 March 2020, 90 053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude latality of 3,4 per cent.
Of course, the letality in Hubei (Chine) is 4,2%, while out of it is 1,2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes serious respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, tones and disnee.
Therapy has also been observed in some patients.
Neumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly evolve the acute respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of a high nucleoid sequence homology of 82%, they are classified in different branches of the philgenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 apparently is less pathogen, but more transmissible in comparison with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of infected asymptomatic people with SARS-CoV-2 have been informed, which could contribute to their rapid propagation throughout the world.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviers, similar and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 remains the general trend of the other six human coronavirus.
Secondly, the seriousness of COVID-19 symptoms is between the SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviers acquired in the community (i.e., HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, the SARS-CoV-2 infection features that are more frequently observed in human coronavirus infections acquired in the community, including the presentation of non-specific or leaks symptoms or, even, the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious COVID cases is also observed as SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is a little lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting characteristic patterns both of the human coronavirus acquired in the community and the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least equal to the human coronavirus acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains checked if the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced after human passes, as happens with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with the other human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 meets a significant role, such as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, should still be dissolved in future studies.
It was also specially interested to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could show stability, such as the case of human coronavirus acquired in the community.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable dissemination after human passes, will affect the final development of the COVID brothing in the course.
The four human coronavirus purchased in the community that causes light symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four human coronaviers.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient pandemics of human coronavirus.
Human coronavirus who cause serious diseases in humans and humans who have developed serious diseases by human coronavirus.
To this happen, human coronavirus should be replicated in humans in a sufficient manner to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that oppose the host's restriction factors.
In this sense, while more time continues the SARS-CoV-2 brothing and the more infected persons, it will be more likely to be completely adapted to humans.
If appropriate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to stop through the quaren or other infectious control measures.
For many years, the four coronavirus purchased in the community have moved into human populations and have caused common feeding in immune people.
These viruses don't need a animal reserve.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV and MERS-COV have not been adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is insufficient.
They need to keep and spread in their zoonotic reservations and seek the opportunity to disseminate human objectives, perhaps through one or more intermediate hosts and amplificators.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as the four human coronavirus acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible as human coronaviers acquired in the community at least at the time.
However, it is more pathogens than human coronavirus acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains seeing whether it will be completely adapted to humans and circle between humans without a heavy animal of reserve or intermediate.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronavirus, we will be useful to examine the definitions and features of the evolutionary, natural guests, reserve, intermediates and human coronavirus simplifications.
A animal acts as an evolutionary hospital of a human coronavirus if he accommodates a closely related older who shares high homology at the level of nucleotic sequence.
The ancestral virus is normally well adjusted and is not pathogen in this guest.
Similarly, a reserve host has a continuous and long-term human coronavirus.
In both cases, hostels are naturally infected and are natural guests of human coronavirus or their parent virus.
Instead, if the human coronavirus is introduced in the fair intermediate before or nearly at the same time of its introduction in humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and usually to be patogen.
The intermediate guest can act as the zoonotic source of human infection and comply with the function of a simplified host by allowing the virus to be transitoryly replicated, and then humans are transmitted to the expansion of human infection.
A human coronavirus can cause a infection in the terminal guest if it is not possible to support its transmission in the intermediate guest.
Instead, human coronavirus can also be adapted to the intermediate host and even to generate long-term endemics.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve host.
The epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had been contacted with caza animals.
Follow-up investigations on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a greater prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
In massized palmers (Larvata Paguma) and a map dog on live animal markets were the first identification of viruss similar to SARS-CoV, which are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were registered after killing all market cibles.
However, it was noted that the clouds of sacred or vegetable palms, without exposure to the markets of lived animals, were most negative in SARS-CoV, which suggested that the massed palms would only act as a simplified intermediate host, but not as a natural reserve of SARS-CoV.
It is not clear that 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies can not be discarded of the possibilities that several smaller mammals also act as a medium guest of the SARS-CoV.
All of them seem to be terminal guests of the SARS-CoV.
A closely related coronavirus of mosquilates, called CoV HKU3 murciélago Rhinolophus related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3).
These murcileals are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genetic sequence.
This and other muscle coronavirus are shared in a 88-92% nucleotic sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have seen the bases of the new concept that murderers have accommodated emergential pathogens in humans.
Various similar coronavirus to SARS (SL-COV) have also been identified in murcileals, but no one, except a named WIV1, can be excluded as a living virus.
It is known that the transforming enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) human is the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was demonstrated that WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of murcilelaces uses the ACE2 of murcileals, citruses and humans as receptive for ingressing cells.
Awesomely, the smile of patients with convalent SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
At the moment, WIV1 represents the most closely related older of the SARS-CoV in murcielals, which shares an homology of nucleoted sequence of 95%.
Despite the high homology between these two viruss, generally, it is believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that murderers are not the immediate reserve host of SARS-CoV.
According to the philosogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 mucilelago and the CV-HKU5 murcilelago.
The CV-HKU4 murcilelago and MERS-CoV use the same host, the dipeptidil peptidasa 4 (DPP4) for the income of the virus.
The polymerarate ARN sequences depending on the MERS-CoV philosogeneticly closed to its betacoronavirus-betacronavirus residents identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, you can't find a living MERS-CoV in wild murcileals.
MERS-CoV and his nearest relatives, the CoV-HKU25 of murciélago, share a number of nucleotic sequences of only 87%.
Indeed, the murderer could not be the immediate reserve host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have demonstrated that drugs are seropositive in MRS-CoV neutralized antibodies specifically, as well as the chambers originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
A MERS-CoV lives identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the narrow nation of drugs, which supports more than the chambers act as a good reserve guest of the MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, weak symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of virus in infected chambers for investigations with MERS-CoV.
Notely, infected chambers propagate virus not only by breathing, but also by fecal-oral way, which is also the main way of propagation of the virus of murcilelages.
However, there are still questions, since many cases confirmed by MERS have no contact before the symptoms appear, which is reasonably allocated to the transmission between humans or to unknown transmissions involved in unrecognised animal species.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleoid homology with a rhinolophus coronavirus of mucilelages, RaTG13, isolated by Rhinolophus fenis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 is too large to allocate a parental relationship.
The murcileans could not be the immediate reserve hosts of the SARS-CoV-2, unless they find in the future of almost identical murcileals.
Probably, the intermediate SARS-CoV-2 animal guests should be among the wild species that are sold and died in Huanan's largest market market, with whom many of the initial cases of COVID-19, which indicates a likely event of transmission of animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequence suggested that a group of small mammals in danger known as pangolines (Javanica Mans), could also accommodate betacoronavirus ancestrales related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genome of this new pangoline coronavirus share a nucleotic sequence monology of 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of around 90 % at the level of nucleotic sequence.
Two sublines similar to SARS-CoV-2 are grouped in the philogenetic tree, one of which shares a domain of receptive association (RBD) most similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a identity of amino acid sequence of 97.4%.
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RBD and RaTG13 are more different, despite a higher sequence homology in the whole genome.
A previous study in pangolines was also informed the detection of viral counts in pulmonary samples, which resulted in being related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted various manual assembly and treatment methods to generate a partial genome sequence that included around 86.3% of the viral genome of complete length.
We cannot disappear the possibility that the pangoline is one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence that it supports a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangoline because of the diversity of sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less than between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutional way of the SARS-CoV-2 in muscles, pangolines and other mammals should still be set.
Although higher sequence homology is found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the higher genome sequence homology.
It is extremely speculative that the high level of sympathy between the RBDs of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the median convergent development of selectivity.
A counterproposal defences recombination between the betacoronavirus of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and the RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As impulsive force in evolution, recombination is extended between betacoronavirus.
There has not yet been a conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of the SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to high pathogenic human coronavirus, HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 was also studied.
The philosogenetic evidence indicated that both HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could have been originated from the muscle coronavirus, while the parent virus of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 were found in routers.
It was reported that a coronavirus of mosquilages called ARCOV.2 (roonavirus of the Apalaches mountains) identified in a three-color mosquilage of North America had a close relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically related to another muscle coronavirus, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although the cameras were also suspected as intermediate guests.
For more clarity, the knowledge of the animal origins of the known human coronavirus is resumed in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The philosogenetic analysis has shown evidence of human coronavirus transmission events between species in the history.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed between species until infecting humans from grain animals in 1890, a breathing pandemia was registered.
The preceding of transmission between HCOV-229E species are not known so precisely.
Alfacoronavirus of murciellas were closely associated with HCOV-229E.
Among them is a alphacoronavirus.
Several evidence lines support the transmission of the virus of murders directly to humans.
First, at the different level, humans could have contact with murderers in a shared environmental nickel.
Instead, humans have close contact with the alps.
Secondly, the alphacoronavirus of mosquilates related to HCOV-229E are different and non-pathogens in the murciel, while alphacoronavirus of alpaca caused respiratory disease brown in the infected animals.
Finally, alphacoronavirus was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of the alphacoronavirus related to human HCOV-229E cannot be discarded.
In fact, murderers are the direct source of pathogenic viruss in humans, such as rabbi virus, Ebola's virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Indeed, it would not be too surprising that the murderers would send HCOV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, while muscular alphacoronavirus act as genetic acquiring of HCOV-229E, alphabees and droids could act as intermediate guests transmitting virus to humans, in particular in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of transmission between species, murderers to drugs, and drugs to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in the murcileals is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by post-locations.
It is obvious that murcileans contribute, with a acquire of virus species, to exchange genetic fragments between species and the transmission between species.
The long-term, deeply popular colonies, the close social interaction and the great capacity to fly, are all favorable conditions that make murders to the ideal "producer of virus".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced in the drugs for decades.
It is well adapted to these chambers, which have been a intermediate host, to be a stable and natural reserve host.
MERS-CoV causes very low disease and maintains relatively low variation rates in these animals.
Their spatial transmission to humans is an accident and humans are still a terminal host of MERS-CoV, since transmission is insufficient.
In comparison with the role of chambers in transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if it was, is different in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, betacoronavirus of pangolines are highly pathogens in pangolines.
It is possible to be a terminal guest of betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, as it is civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
several transmission possibilities between species of the SARS-CoV-2 of human animals, should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First of all, murderers could be the reserve host of a SARS-CoV-2 virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological nickel with the murderers, through the killing or the mining of carbon.
Secondly, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplificators where a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 was recently introduced.
Humans oppose the virus through the killing and the consumption of caza flesh.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be likely to be SARS-CoV-2.
An antibodies study is required in home animals and wild animals.
Thirdly, as previously mentioned, the recombination and adjustment of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that have contacted both with murcileals and pangolines.
The search for animal origins of the SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the various types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play a significant role in facilitating the crops of the species.
First, its relative change rates in the replication of the ARN.
In comparison with other monocatenary ARN viruss, the estimated change rates of the coronavirus could be considered "modered" to "also" with a mean substitution rate of ~10-4 replacements per year, by site 2, according to the adaptation phase of the coronavirus to new guests.
The coronavirus has an exorribonuclea of read-testing, whose elimination from place to extremely high variability and the attenuation or even the inviability.
Currently, the nucleotic analogy remdesivir removes the replication of the coronavirus through the inhibition of this exorribonuclease and the ARN polymerasis dependent on ARN.
remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, the change rates of the coronavirus are about a million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the change rate is generally high when the coronavirus is not well adapted to the guest.
In comparison with SARS-CoV, which has a high variation rate, the changing rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, which suggests a higher level of adjustment to humans.
It is expected that another guest has already been adapted close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this applies also to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to drugs.
In theory, it is unlikely that the genetic derivative makes vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 lose their effectiveness rapidly.
Secondly, the long ARN genome of the coronavirus exercises additional plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombination, and thus increases the probability of coevolution between species, which provides the appearance of new coronavirus when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the unique copyright open reading frameworks and the functions of the proteins encoded to direction 3 of the genome.
Thirdly, coronavirus changes randomly and frequently templates during replication of the ARN through a single "copy-choice mechanism".
In a guest acting as a mixture vehicle, the chain change is often produced during the ARN transcrimination of the coronavirus.
ARN of complete and subgenomical length could be re-administered to generate new coronavirus.
The philogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coronavirus, such as the SL-COV of mucilelago and the CV-HKU9.
Virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the virus interaction with the host receiver is another key factor that affects the transmission between species.
In the present, the recombination of the SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in events of transmission between species.
Based on the comparative analysis between human-coV-isolated SARS-CoV-ceases, it is believed that SARS-CoV experiences a rapid adjustment in different guests, particularly with mutations in the S-protein RBD.
Generally, the RBD of Protein S of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the response of the guest antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in 318-510 amino acids in the S1 fragment, which is one of the human ACE2 and its corrections for viral entry.
SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognise ACE2 receipters from several animals, including mushrooms, bones, mouse and map dogs, which allows the transmission between virus species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were different from human virus isolated cepas and cives in the RBD and 4 of them were found in the reason of association to the receptive for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV switch has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the proportion of the interaction of spy protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two substitutions of amino acid could be essential for adapting the virus to humans.
It is emphasized that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein S unit implies that the proportion of protein S' unions with human ACE2 could have been changed.
Indeed, an electronic chromicscopical study indicates the proportion of 10 to 20 times greater than this unit in comparison with human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein.
It will also be interested to determine whether any other corrector could be necessary for the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.
Surely, HCOV-NL63 is also one of the ACE2, but with a different part of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptide N in HCOV-229E and 9-O-accepted seal acid in HCOV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirus in humans, after transmission of species from their animal guests.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of the transmission between the species of human coronavirus is also determined by other factors of dependence and restriction of the guest.
The divergence of these guest proteins between humans and natural reserve hosts of human coronavirus, such as murderers, drugs and roeders, could be an obstacle to transmission between species.
Human coronavirus should use host dependence factors and substantive hostage restrictions factors so that the transmission between species is successful.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of interaction with virus-hoested should still be identified and characterized.
A Objective Research of complete genome could result in use of SARS-CoV-2 through advanced CRISPR technologie.
Appeal of new human coronavirus: we leave from zero
The diversity of the mushrooms coronavirus gives many opportunities for the appearance of new human coronavirus.
In this sense, muscle coronavirus acts as the genetic scope of human coronavirus.
Furthermore, the rapid change and genetic recombination, also stimulate the evolution of human coronavirus and represent two important steps in this process.
For example, the purchase or loss of new protein coder genes have the potential to drastically change viral phenotypes.
Among the accessive proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in adjustment to humans, since it was isolated with SARS-CoV, but was determined that ORF8 different proteins were encoded.
A deletion of 29 SARS-COV nucleotic characters was found in isolated cepas at the start of human epidemic.
This elimination divides ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed that it is a adaptive change that promotes the change of guests.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has potential recombination preceding with alpha and gammacoronavirus rings, where a larger number of rebuilding regions were identified in polymeraric ARN dependent on ARN.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of Nsp10 and parts of Nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemics had suffered recombination events between different languages, which occurred in drugs in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, reconstruction events have also been observed in other human coronaviruss, in which human coronavirus are recombined with other animal coronavirus in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that the artificial selection can contribute to non-deseared changes in viral genomes, which is most likely to release viruses from the selection pressures exercised, for example by the host's immune system.
One example of these effects is the loss of an ORF4 full length in the HCoV-229E prototype cep, due to a elimination of two nuclears.
Although a ORF4 intact intaked in the HCOV-229E and cattles related to the Alfacoronavirus could be observed, the alfacoronavirus of alpaca presents an insertion of a single nucleote, which would result in a framework change.
Lastly, although not less important, the evolution of the new human coronavirus is also stimulated by selecting pressure in their guests of reservation.
No symptoms were detected or only leak symptoms were detected when muscles were infected with coronavirus, which indicates the mutual adjustment between the coronavirus and the murcilelages.
It seems that muscles are well adapted to anatomic and physiological coronavirus.
For example, defects in the activation of the proinflammatory response in murcilelages reduce effectively the pathology caused by the coronavirus.
Furthermore, the activity of natural murder cells in the murders is eliminated due to the positive regulation of the inhibition receptor of natural murder cells NKG2/CD94 and the lower level of expression of class I of the higher histoic compliance complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive species of oxygen (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity of muscles could eliminate the replication of the coronavirus and affect the testing of exorribonuclease legitation, which provides the selection pressure for generating high pathogenic virus cepas when introduced in a new host.
The more pathogenic coronavirus cepas could also evolve by recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adjustment to the guest.
Therefore, it is not possible that three new human coronavirus have appeared in the past two decades.
The coronavirus is not pathogens or causes light symptoms in their guests of reserve, such as murcileals and cakes.
They are energyly replicated without causing a strong immune response to the guest.
This raises secrets why there are asthmatical portators and what causes the serious infections in humans.
Severe symptoms should primarily be the hyperactivation of immune response and the torment of cytocins, in which the more stronger is immune response, more seriously is pulmonary damage.
Instead, in the asthmatical portators, immune response has been dissolved from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same anti-SARS-CoV-2 strategy to devine immune response could have benefits.
The interferon response is especially strong in the murders.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon should therefore be beneficial at least in the early phase of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 in humans.
Furthermore, the activation of the NLRP3 inflamoma in the mosquitoes is defectuous.
According to this reasoning, NLRP3 inflamamma inhibition with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 remains the general line leading to the appearance of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a betacoronavirus of murcilelaes has been found that shares a 95% nucleoid monology with SARS-CoV, there is also a muscleaid coronavirus that shares a 96% nucleote monology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although clouds and other animals of the market have been determined to accommodate identical virus to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate guests of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Betacoronavirus of pangolines has been significantly homologed to SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests, or that betacoronavirus of pangolines could bring gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questionnaire remains, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made by the man, being deliberately or by accident.
The coronavirus have recovered protagonism because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 breast.
The study of the coronavirus in musulmans and other animals has deeply changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and the animal reserves of human coronavirus in human transmission.
Another evidence has demonstrated that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were originated in the murders and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hospitals.
Since infection by SARS-CoV originates in the contact between human and market cives, closure the hume markets and killing the clouds that had been in them could have been effective to fresh the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reason, pangolines should be removed from hume markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, taking into account the discovery of several betacoronavirus switchs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals remains disappointed in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV exists in the droids for many years.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, cow and lana for the local population.
They are widely distributed by the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all chambers to control MERS, as was done in China with the sacred animal markets to prevent the propagation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent MERS brotes, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for chambers, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to remove these viruses, they might appear new genotypes that cause brots.
A variety of zoonotic coronavirus are circulated in savity state.
In particular, muscle coronavirus with potential zoonotics are very different.
There are major possibilities that these zoonotic coronavirus evolution and recovery, which would take place to the appearance of new coronavirus that are more transmissible or more mortal in humans in the future.
The culture of savied animals in some places of China should be abandoned to reduce the unnecessary contact between human and animals.
From the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed in the planet for a long time.
Keep in their own natural reservations until the opportunity to propagate is presented.
Although murderers have many features that promote the dissemination of virus, human contact opportunities with murderers and other wild species may be minimised if they are educated to the population.
Continue monitoring of mothers is necessary to better understand the ecology of the coronavirus and their natural guests, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of animals to humans and breasts.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is that humans are being left from the ecological nicks of the natural reserves of zoonotic viruses.
There are still several parts in the rupture of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin.
First of all, if the museums transmit a ancestral virus from the SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze what circumstances the murcileals and pangolines could share the same environmental nick.
Secondly, if murderers have a more direct role in human transmission, humans should be determined how to contact murderers.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true hospital intermediate, it must be diluted how it interacts with different species, including humans, murcileals and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be likely to be SARS-CoV-2, the supervision and experimental infection should be carried out.
It is already a murcilelago, a pangolin or another mammal, is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent virus that are almost identical are identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continued research in this area will dilute the evolutional way of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with significant implications in prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The criteria for diagnosis of "speaked cases" and "confirmated cases" of COVID-19 should be updated.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid advisory guide for diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCOV), and this guide included our experience and is a good reference to fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and our knowledge are gradually increased on the basis of the results of current investigations and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our guideline and provide the most recent diagnostic criteria of "speaked case" and "as confirmed" according to the last guidelines for COVID diagnosis and treatment (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCOV) caused a brown, which is now officially known as the illness of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named Coronavirus 2 of the serious respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO was qualified to COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the infection by SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a rapid advisory guide that was published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
He took a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and our knowledge are gradually increased on the basis of the results of current research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, COVID diagnostic and treatment guidelines published by the National Health Committee of the People ' s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts significantly changed.
Our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., submitted a simple classification proposal based on its clinical experience.
His work has added new evidence for our guide and also represents a valuable reference for this pandemic throughout the world.
We support your important work and express our gratitude.
However, its work also needs to update according to the last COVID diagnosis and treatment guidelines (seventh test version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020) to confirm a suspicious case, any point of epidemiological precedence must be combined with two points of clinical manifestations to make an exhaustive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be fulfilled if there are no clear epidemic preceding:
Epideological advances: (1) travel or residence in the city of Whan and the German areas, or other communities in which the cases of COVID-19 were informed in the past 14 days before the appearance of the symptoms; (2) the presence of contact with infected cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a test of positive nuclear acid); (3) beforewards of contact with patients with fever or symptoms of the city of Whan and the garden regions, or other communities in which COVID-19 cases were informed in the last 14 days before symptoms appearing; (4) previous contacts with groups confirmed (≥ 2 or 2 cases of symptoms of breathing in the second week).
Clinical manipulations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection images; (3) total containers of white globules showing a container of normal, decreased or reduced linfocytes in the early start phase.
The diagnostic of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with some character of pathogenic or serological tests in the following way: (1) the test of the polymerrase reaction in a real time positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the sequence of the complete viral genome that shows high homogeneity to the new coronavirus recognised; (3) positive results for the specific IgM antibodies and the specific IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a summer test; or a change of the IG anticuer against the negative SARS-CoV-2, or increased title of the incidence ≥4 times in the phase of recovery.
We can see that the real time-reaction test of polymerasie in real time to detect nuclear acid in blood samples or respiratory ways was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of pathogens of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) editions, and then the serological tests were added to the seventh edition.

Furthermore, there are more evidence that they remember that we should be careful with asthmatical and symptoms patients.
Therefore, the flow diagram of Zhou and al. must be updated, since they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The pointing system should also be checked in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we expect more direct evidence and request the readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "sound case" and "as confirmed," we recommend searching and implementing the newest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines in a timely way to provide help.
Bangladesh informs five new deaths because of COVID-19, the largest number in one day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths last night because of COVID-19 in one day.
It's the largest number of deaths in a day because of virus.
By yesterday, the Bangladesh Epidemiology Institute, Disease and Investigation (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovery cases remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
At a online informal meeting, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the victims were four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two between 51 and 60 years and one between 41 and 50 years.
He also said that two of the victims were Daca's.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic COVID-19.
One hospital officer told him to Anadolu Agency, a local media of news, that one of the defeats was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anticorruption Commission, who was attending in Kuwait Maytree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a online video advertising, the Minister for Trade and Bangladesh Points Obaidul Quader said that public transport would be suspended for more than the initially expected, until this next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport was initially started on 26 March and was expected to end Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products was still allowed, such as medical supply, fuel and food.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection occurred in Bangladesh on 8 March, two men returned from Italy and the woman of one of them.
On March 19, there were three if they had been recovered.
More than a million SARS-CoV-2 infections throughout the world
Juvenile, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infections over a million over the world, according to the Johns Hopkins University's data.
At least 52.000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The hot was the same day as Malaui confirmed his first colonavirus infections and Zambia had his first death related to the coronavirus.
North Korea stated, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
On the last day, the World Health Organization informed 1 051 635 cases confirmed, including 79 332 cases in the twenty-first hours before 10:00 a.m., European Central Hour (UTC-0800), of 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were registered, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting the data from University Johns Hopkins, that Sunday was more than 1000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
In the whole world, countries announced more strict measures to prevent disease propagation.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the camper of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until 1 May.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to understand their wages without going to work until 30 April.
The Portugal Parliament voted to extend the national emergency status 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes for, ten abstentions and a vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the rest to the sanctuary citys La Meca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the remaining touch was held only between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
Thai planned to implement a residue touch between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until 1 May.
Supermarkets in Australia decreased the hygienic paper limits by transaction
Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian Supermarket Chains Woolworths and Coles decreased their hygienic paper limits to two and a transaction package in all the supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were published as messages on the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chain.
According to the report, consumers were disappointed by fear of COVID-19 in case people had to be self-released.
Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of hygienic papers to deliver home to a request package.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four transaction packages applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his press communication on 8 March, reported that, with the implementation of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets even ended the product within a time of delivery," and said that the request "no previous," while ALDI, in a Facebook publication, said that it was "unexpected".
The sales were undergoing the last week, according to a Woolworths voter.
Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
In order to improve the shortage, Coles requested more packages to providers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional existence, while ALDI had existence to be available for a special offer of Monday planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of Australian Retailers Association, said that minorists are trying to increase the existence, but the restrictions of local rents on vehicle deliveries are difficult.
It provides an increase in production costs, in accordance with suppliers, to satisfy the demand, and less offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the previous release of stocks, some supermarkets could not make the special offer of Monday.
In a report in News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a minorist expert at the University of Queensland Technology, said that supermarkets provide the existence every night.
He stressed that the hygienic role is a volunteer article, which causes a low amount of existence in numbers, and, when explode, leave a wide space in the stars, which intensifys the sense of slowness.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [que] if there was a abundant amount of article in the stages, if products like hygienic and desinfecting paper roles could be [build] and have large amounts, probably would be minimised by the panic, said Russell Zimmerman by ABC News.
The manufacturer of hygienic paper reciclated Who Gives to Crap told the past Wednesday that they exhausted the existence.
Kimberly-Clark, who produced the Kleenex hygienic role, and Solaris paper, which produced Sorbent, pointed out that they were working 24 hours the week's 7 days, to maintain the supply, according to the report in News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some owners of property offered free hygienic role to the first offerer in the shops in Melbourne, when less substances were performed because the buyers had a free weekend of the Worker Day.
The edition of NT News, a newspaper in Darwin, included a eight-page card designed to cut down and use as a hygienic paper.
The supermarkets at the principle were reacted to imply restrictions, according to an Australian ABC report of 3 March, in which they said that there were no plans to introduce acquire restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including maskers, desinfecting, severe products, liquid jabine and skin.
Similarly, out of Australia, Sunday afternoon was observed that the British Online Supermarket Oka limited the purchase of the Hygienic Role Andres's 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization declares pandemic COVID-19
On Monday, the World Health Organization (OMS) declared pandemic the current COVID brote, the disease caused by the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus.
Although the word "pandemia" only refers to the dimension of dissemination of a disease, not how dangerous are the specific cases, WHO stressed the need to encourage Governments to take measures:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, do tests, treat, islan, identified and mobilize their people in the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.
We are very concerned, both of the alarming levels of propagation and seriousness, as well as of the alarming inaction levels.
According to Dr. Tom Peace, director of the Control Centres and the Prevention of Nurses in the United States, pandemia "no preceding".
In the statements published by CNN in February, "as far as the influenza, no other respiratory virus has been raised from the appearance to the continuing world propagation."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, and said, "We have never seen a pandemia caused by a coronavirus."
"And we never had seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," acknowledged.
The new condition of pandemic emerges after WHO's decision in January to declare a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infections in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the brood, "It will, in conclusion, worse".
To Thursday, Associated Press reported that at least 126.000 cases of COVID-19 were worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The pandemic of the coronavirus 2019–20 is a cured pandemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 of the serious respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
The brochure identified in Whan, China, in December 2019, was declared internationally important health emergency on 30 January 2020, and was recognized as pandemia on 11 March 2020.
On 10 April 2020, about 1,61 million COVID cases were reported in 210 countries and territorys, and about 97,000 deaths were resulted.
Some 364.000 people were rebuilding.
It was estimated that the letality rate per case was of 4 per cent in China, while at the global level, 13.04 per cent in Algeria and 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Frequent symptoms include fever, tube and lack of air.
The complications may include neumony and syndrome of acute respiratory difficulty.
The time from exposure to the appearance of the symptoms, generally, is from some five days, but it can vary from two to fourty days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and support therapy. Recommendated preventive measures include lavaring hands, covering the mouth in the tube, maintaining distance from other people, and controlling and self-related persons suspected to be infected.
The authorities of the whole world responded through the implementation of travel restrictions, quarters, retreat touches, danger controls on the place of work and installation closures.
Pandemia caused a serious socioeconomic global change, posting or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the generalized deficit of supplies raised by panic purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local levels in 193 countries, which affected about 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
Error information on the Internet virus was distributed, and there were incidents of xenofobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other ascensiva and Asian appearance, and other areas with significant virus cases.
Because of the reduction in travels and the closures of the weighty industry, air pollution and carbon emissions were reduced.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Whan, China, (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a group of unknowledged neumony cases and started an investigation at the beginning of January 2020.
The cases, mostly, were related to Huanan's larger market market, so the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the breast is known as SARS-CoV-2, a new discovery virus closely related to the museum coronavirus, the pangolines and the SARS-CoV. Afterward, it was found that the first person that was known that symptoms were ill on 1 December 2019, and that person had no visible connections with the last group of the moderate market.
From the first group of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds had a market link.
On 13 March 2020, an uncontrolled South China Morning Post report suggested that, a case resigned on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old person from the province of Hubei could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases, according to the reports, were decreased in China but gradually increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had first exceededed the number of new cases within China.
There may be a significant amount of uninformed cases, especially among those with less symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those of 19 and less people represented 2.4 per cent of the cases in the world. Patrick Vallance, the United Kingdom primary Scientist, estimated that 60 per cent of the British population had to be infected before a effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people subject to tests of COVID-19 and have received a positive outcome confirmed according to official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries have had official policies to not perform evidence in persons who only had light symptoms such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China until 23 January, a estimated amount of 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these non-registered infections were the source of 79% of the registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March suggested that the amounts of infections in Italy were significantly higher than the cases reported.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Control Centres and the Prevention of Nurses decided that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovery.
For those who did not, the time passed from the development of symptoms until death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most frequentest 14 days.
On 10 April 2020, about 97 000 deaths had been assigned to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths corresponded to people older than 60 years and 75 per cent had preexistent diseases, including cardiovascular and diabetes. Official death records for COVID pandemia-19, generally refer to defeated persons who have made positive COVID tests, according to official protocols.
It is possible that the amount of real deaths because of COVID-19 is much higher, because may not be included in persons who have failed to do the test, for example, in their homes, in older homes, etc.
Partal data in Italy revealed that the amount of additional deaths during pandemia exceeded the official COVID death record in a factor from 4 to 5 times.
One voter of the United States Control Centres and the Prevention of Nurses (CDC) admitted "We know that [the amount of declared deaths] is a substimation", a statement corrupted by the anecdotic sub-containing reports in the United States. This substimation is frequent in pandemics, such as the porcine grip pandemia H1N1 of 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Whan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China was occurred on February 1th in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On February 28, outside the continental China, more than twenty deaths were registered in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than fourty countries and territories had reported deaths in all continents except Antarctics, generally several indicators were used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and with the time, and are influenced by the quantity of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time passed from the initial brochure and the quality of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the amount of deaths shared by the amount of cases diagnosed within a determinated period of time.
According to the statistics of University Johns Hopkins, the global death rate of cases is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) to 10 April 2020.
The number would varie according to the region.
In China, the estimates of death rates in cases reduced from 17.3 per cent (in those with the appearance of symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (in those with the appearance of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the letality rate by cases, reflecting the percentage of diagnosed persons who suffered from a disease, and the letality rate of infection, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnostic and non-diagnostic) that caused a disease.
These statistics do not have a specific period and consider a specific population from infection until the case is resolved.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates the letality rate for pandemic infections in its totality is 0.1% to 0.39%.
The higher estimation of this range is coherent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study which analyzed the impact of the tests on the rate of letality by cases.
WHO claims that pandemia can be controlled.
The pipe and the final duration of the brown are incerted and can differ according to the location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said, "Infectional brotes, if they are not controlled, are generally stabilized and then start to decrease when sickness remains without available hospitals.
But, at this moment, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction when it will happen."
The main medical adviser of the Government of China, Zhong Nanshan, said that it could "determine in June" if it can be moved to all countries to follow the recommendations of WHO on measures to stop the dissemination of virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the University of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine of London, expressed that SARS-CoV-2 "is going to be circulated, perhaps for one or two years."
According to the study of the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, the physical distance and other measures will be necessary "too there is a vaccine (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University expressed: "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, since it is transmitted with such easyness, disappears completely" and "It could become a state disease that repairs all the years."
The virulence of the recovery would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of change.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively not specific and infected persons may be asintomatic.
The two most frequent symptoms are fever (88%) and dry tons (68%).
The less frequent symptoms include fatigue, smuggling production in respiratory ways (phrame), loss of oilfate, lack of air, muscular and articular pain, guard pain, head pain, slowness, heopites, diarree or cyanosis. WHO states that some of the six people are seriously sick and have difficulties to breathe.
According to the United States Control Centres and the Prevention of Nurses (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulties to breathe, pressure or pain persistent in the skin, repentin confusion, difficulty to disperse and blue color in the face or laugh; before the manifestation of these symptoms, the immediate medical care is recommended. The largest progress of the disease can cause serious neumony, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic choque and death.
Some of the infected persons may be asintomatic, not present clinical symptoms, although the test results confirm the infection, researchers therefore suggested to control and carefully review those who have closely contact with infected persons to defeat infection.
The Chinese estimates of the percentage of asthmatical persons occide from a few to 44 per cent.
The usual incubation period (time between infection and symptoms appearing) covers from one to 14 days; more frequently is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimation of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of Olfate at the beginning was 30% and then reduced to 15%.
There are still some details of how the disease is spread.
The disease is predominantly propagated during the close contact and through the small skins that produce toser, enormous or conversation; close contact is considered a distance from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, the cups can be moved from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 m (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted through small skins that remain in the air during the longer periods, which can be generated to speak.
The bones can enter the mouth or the narrow of the people who are near or, perhaps, be inclined to the pulmones.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonal reanimation (RCP), may cause respiratory secrets aerosolization and, therefore, air propagation.
It can also be spread when one touchs a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touchs the eyes, nase or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through the works, it is believed that this risk is low.
The Government of China rejected the possibility of the Oral Fecal Transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious over the first three days after the appearance of symptoms, although the propagation may be possible before the symptoms and in advanced stages of disease.
People received positive results in the disease tests up to three days before the appearance of symptoms, which indicates that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only some reports of asthmatical cases confirmed by the laboratory, but some countries have identified an asthmatical transmission during contact trace investigations.
The European Centre for Prevention and Disease (ECDC) states that, although it is not completely clear the facility with which the disease is distributed, generally a person infected to two or three other, and virus survives from hours to day on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was determined for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and inoxidable steel 304, one day in carton and four hours in copper.
This would, however, occur according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in tests of COVID-19 to mascotes and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend the hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that could have touched infected people.
The coronavirus 2 of the serious respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was isolated for the first time of three people with neumony linked to the group of acute respiratory diseases in Whan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronavirus related to nature. Out of the human body, the virus dies when they are in contact with jabon, which develops its protective envolvement. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's thinking you have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the betacoronavirus genre, its subgener sarbecovirus (linea B) and two of the mucilelago derivated.
At the level of the complete genome, it is 96 % identical to other samples of muscilelago coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only a difference in amino acids in some parts of the genome sequences between pangoline viruses and human beings.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that the coronavirus of pangolines and SARS-CoV-2 shared as maximum 92% of genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that pangolines are the intermediary host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although the last instance is confirmed by the reaction of polymerarase with inverse transcriptase (RRT-PCR) of infected secrets or by computer-tomography images.
According to a study carried out in Whan, in which the polymerara reaction was compared with computer-tomography, the computer-tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerrase reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in images correspond to the processes of other diseases and neumonies.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends "not use the computerized tomography as a detection method or a test of first line to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first published on 17 January.
The test uses the reaction in the polymerara string with reverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done in samples of blood or respiratory.
The results are generally available within some hours or days.
In general, this test is carried out with a nasopharinge hysop, although it can also be used for the gargant. Some laboratorys and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, no one of them showed that it was sufficiently necessary to approve its generalized use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certificates only.
The characteristic races in computerized radiographics and tomographics (TC) of symptoms include attractions in asimetric peripheral displayed visions and outstanding lamentation.
Italian Radiology Society is compiling a online international database of the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Because of supervision with other infections like adenovirus, diagnosis by images without confirmation is limited to the identification of COVID-19.
A comprehensive study carried out in China compared the results of computerized torax tomography with polymerarase reaction and showed that, although image diagnosis is less specific for infection, it is quick and sensible, which suggests its consideration as a detection tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neuronal networks based on artificial intellectual intelligence were developed to detect virus features in images, both with radiographs and computer-tomography.
The strategies for preventing the transmission of disease include maintenance of a general personal hygiene, laying hands, avoid touching eyes, narrow or mouth with hands without having been laid before, and shock or touching on a deceased puzzle and shoot the puzzle directly into a deceastal container.
Those who could already be infected are recommended to use a surgical masker in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent the transmission. Many Governments have restricted or disadvised all non-essential travels from and to countries and areas affected by breast.
However, the virus has reached the Community propagation phase in many parts of the world.
This means that virus is spread within the communities, and some community members do not know where or how they have been infected. It is recommended that medical care providers who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use the eye protection. The track of contacts is an important method to determine the origin of infection and to prevent greater transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments to this end has generated concerns about privacy, and the International Amnesty and more than 100 other organizations made a statement to require limits on this type of monitoring.
A number of mobile applications for voluntary use have been implemented or proposed, and on 7 April 2020 more than a twenty-five of experts groups were working in respectable solutions with privacy, such as use of Bluetooth to register the nearness of a user to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they were closely contacted with someone who gave positive COVID-19 tests. They are surrounded erroneous ideas about how to prevent infection; for example, skin lavage and guards with bucal shock are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
The lavage of hands is recommended to prevent disease propagation.
CDC recommends that people lift their hands frequently with water and jabine during at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bath or when they have visiblely sweet hands; before eating and after sleeping the nail, toser or exhort.
This should be said that, outside the human body, the virus dies when he enters in contact with jabon, which disintegres his protective bottle.
CDC also recommended use of desinfective for alcohol hands with at least 60 % of volume alcohol when water and jabon is not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with hands without having laid them before.
The surfaces may be discontaminated with several solutions (in one minute after the desinfecting exposure to an inoxidable steel surface), including ethanol to 62 to 71 %, isopropanol to 50 to 100 %, sodium hydrochloroid to 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide to 0,5 % and yoda povudine 0,2–7,5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium gluconate and clorhexin glucoon, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a installation such as a office or guard, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, tactile screens, keyboards, remote controls and automatic boxes that have used nurses.
Health organizations recommend that people cover the mouth and the nase with the flexioned cow or with a deceasable snake to touch or exornate, and that they immediately desire the puzzle.
It is recommended that those who may be infected use surgical maskers, since the use of a masker can limit the volume and distance accumulated by breathing bones that are dispersed when talking, exciting and toser.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use the mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Using a mascarilla can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch the face, which is an important source of infection without adequate hand hygiene."
WHO recommended the use of maskers by healthy people only if they run a high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although also recognised that maskers can help people to avoid touching the face.
several countries have started to promote the use of maskers by the public.
In the U.S., CDC recommended using non-medical maskers which were produced with the screen. China specifically recommended the use of decreasing medical maskers by public healthy members, especially when they are in contact near (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends to use a surgical mask to take public transport or be in competitive places.
The health officials of Thailand recommend that people manufacture screen mask in their homes and lay them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited out of public spaces without using a mask or cooking nest and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that all people use a mask when they are in public spaces to be able to protect and protect others.
The Austrian Government requested the use of mass by all persons income to a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use maskers in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million mask per day since mid- March, requested the use of maskers by passengers in interurban trains and buses.
Panamá uses the obligatory use of masks to get out of air while also recommends the manufacture of masses made in house to those who can't buy them.
The maskers have also been used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (as well known as physical distance) includes measures to control infection designed to strike the dissemination of disease by minimising close contact between people.
The methods include quarters, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stages, theatres and commercial centres.
People can implement social distance methods when they stay in their homes, restrict travels, avoid competitive areas, use health forms that do not include contact and physically distance from other people.
Many governments now require or recommend social distance in regions affected by breast.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by Governments and health organizations of the United States was slowly reduced from 250 persons (if it had not been known for COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited public meetings of more than two persons, and adults and those with substantive diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension and immune systems are more risked to suffer serious diseases and complications, and CDCs recommend that they remain in their homes as well as possible in the areas of the community affected by breast. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other healthal bodies began to replace the use of the term "social resistance" by "physical existence" to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contacts while maintaining social, virtually or dignity.
The use of the term "social detention" has been influenced by the suggestion that people should adopt a full social isolation instead of encourageing them to stay in contact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have published sexual health guidelines to use during pandemic.
They include only sexual relations with a person with whom it is convincing, which does not have virus or symptoms of virus.
The home self-alimentation was recommended for those who have been diagnosed the COVID-19 and who suspected that they have been infected.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on adequate self-alimentation. Many Governments have requested or recommended the self-commerce of total populations in the areas affected.
The most strict self-commerce instructions were issued for those belonging to high risk groups.
Those who have been in contact with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or a generally transmitted region are recommended to make self-commerce for 14 days since the last possible exhibition.
Strategics to control a brown are container or suppression and mitigation.
The container is carried out in the first stages of the breast and has the purpose of identifying and isolating infected persons, in addition to introducing other infected and vaccines control measures to prevent disease from the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control dissemination of disease, efforts are moved to the mixation phase: measures are taken to strike the propagation and mitigate their effects on the health system and society.
A combination of maintenance and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time.
The elimination requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse pandemia through the reduction of the basic reproduction number at least 1 part of controlling the brown of a infected disease implies to try to reduce the epidemic pipe, which is known as planning epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of collapse of health services and allows more time for vaccines and treatments.
The non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the broth include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of mass and self-commerce; Community measures aimed at distance, such as closure of schools and cancellation of massive competition events; Community commitment to promote acceptance and participation in these interventions; and environmental and cleaning of surfaces; in China, more dramatic measures were taken to contain breast when their gravity resulted, for example, the implementation of quantitals in all cities and the imposition of strict travel prohibitions.

The Italian newspaper La Prespa quoted an anonymous "Political Source of High-level" which claimed that 80% of Russia's aid was "inutile or little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of employing an offensive "geopolitical and diplomatic seduction".
The President of Lombardia, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the periodic reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a loading aircraft to the United States.
The cremlin port, Dmitry Peskov, said that "in offering assistance to the United States colleagues [Putin], the U.S. manufacturers of medical materials and equipment can also match if necessary."
The planned military exercise of NATO "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the most largest war exercise of NATO since the end of the Friday War, will be carried out at a lower scale.
The Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the exercise of the Defender 2020: "In the current crisis of public health, the lives of the United States and the various European countries participating, but also of the peoples of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian Government was very affected by the virus, with about two decades of infected parliament members, and over 15 other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, the President of Iran, Hassan Rohani, wrote a public letter to the world leaders to ask for help, and said that his country is having difficulties to fight the brochure because of the lack of access to international markets as a result of the sanctions of the United States against Iran. The blog emphasized the demand that the United States should adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal medical care, universal child care, family licensation and higher levels of public health.
Political analysts predicted that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election opportunities in the presidential election of 2020. The diplomatic relationships between Japan and South Korea were deteriorated because of pandemia.
South Korea criticized the "big and passive quarentery efforts" in Japan, after Japan announced that any person from South Korea will be in quarentery for two weeks on sites designated by the Government.
The South Korean society was polarized in terms of the response of Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests for the Destitution of Moon for a bad manner of breast by the Government, or to join their response. Pandemia allowed countries to approve emergency legislation.
Some commenters expressed the concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.

The coronavirus brote was condemned in several cases of lack of supply, as a result of the greatest use of machines to combat breasts, purchases stimulated by panics and interruptions of logistics and manufactures.
The Administration of Food and Medicines in the United States has made warnings about the lowness of medicines and medical equipment because of the largest demand for consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
Several locations also have acquired shops stimulated by the panic that left the empty stars of essential products, such as food, hygienic paper and water, which caused the lowness of supply.
In particular, the technological sector has been warning about delays in electronic products sending.
According to the WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom, the request for personnel protection teams has increased 100 times.
This request generated an increase in the prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays from four to six months in the supply of medical articles.
He also caused a low number of personal protection teams throughout the world, and WHO warned that this would put health workers in danger.
In Australia, the pandemic offered a new opportunity to buy the buyers to sell Australian products in China.
In spite of the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the northern Italy and the Whan region, and of the subsequent demand of food products, no of these areas had been affected by the augmentation of food.
The measures of China and Italy against the illicit accumulation and trade of essential products have been successful and have prevented a deep decline of food expected in Europe and North America.
The northern Italy, with its significant agricultural production, has not had significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to the sector representatives.
Food stars were only temporaryly empty, even in the city of Whan, while Chinese government officials released the skin meat reserves to ensure the sufficient food of the population.
There are similar laws that require food producers to maintain reserves for such emergency.
The damage in the world economy was held in China: According to a periodic report of 16 March, China's economy was very affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the Government to stop the dissemination of virus, and minorist sales falled 20.5 per cent.
Since the continental China is an important economic and manufacturer centre, viral broth has been considered a significant threat to destabilization for global economy.

The three indexes ended the week with lower than 10 %.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH declared China's sovereign credit qualification, but he maintained a negative perspective.
The action was again under the basis of fears by the coronavirus, and the largest fall occurred on March 16th.
Many believe that there is a economic recession likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian expressed the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than they reacted to the 2008 financial failure.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors because of travel prohibitions, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of governments to not travel to any part of the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights because of the smallest demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British Regional Aeroline Flybe falling.
The impact on the cross-border business sector has never reached a level.
A number of rail stations and transborder terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic corresponded to the Chunyun, an important time of travels related to the New China's fellowships.
A number of events in which large multitudes participated were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the New Year Festivals, while private companies also closed their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many tourist events and attractions of the New Lunar Year have been closed to avoid the massive concentrations, including the prohibited city of Peking and the traditional temple holidays.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's feast until 10 February, and ordered to most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the GDP and 90% of the exports from the country.
Hong Kong led its level of response to the highest infected disease and declared an emergency, closed schools up to March and cancelled its New Year celebrations. The minorist sector had been affected at the world level, with reductions in care or temporary closures.
Visits to minorities in Europe and Latin America reduced 40 per cent.
Migrants of North and Middle East America experienced a fall of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also occurred a decrease of 33 to 43 per cent in the peatorial transit to commercial centres in March compared with February.
Operators of the commercial centres worldwide set additional measures, such as higher hygiene, the establishment of the thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and the cancellation of events. According to a estimation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, pandemic income could leave between 14 and 22 million people in an extreme poverty situation in Latin America more than they had been in this situation without pandemia.
In January and February 2020, during the highest epidemic point in Whan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the nearly 300 million rural employees from China have been changed in their homes in the provinces of the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government assistance.
The coronavirus brochure could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32 per cent, according to estimates of the Bank of the Federal Reserve of San Luis. The confidence in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant employees (which they receive daily salary) and 44 per cent of Canadian homes experienced some kind of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers requested temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British employees requested universal credit plans. About a half million companies in Germany have implemented short-term working schemes, known as Kurswork, for their workers.
The German work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The sectors of scenic arts and cultural heritage have been deeply affected by pandemic, which has reflected on the operations of organizations and people, both employed and independent around the world.
The organizations of the culture sector and arts were trying to perform their mission (freely financed with public funds) to provide their access to the cultural heritage, to maintain the security of their employees and the public, and to support artists when possible.
For March 2020, the museums, libraries, spectacles and other cultural institutions were infinitely closed, and their exposures, events and spectacles were cancelled or posted.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence and that increases the rapidized ritm of disease is the cancellation of religious services. important sports events and other social events such as music and concert festivals, technologie conferences and modes deficiencies.
The cinematographic industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Santa Semana in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Cristian Penitity Time of the Cuaresma.
Many dioceans have recommended that older Christians remain in their homes instead of attending Sundays; some churches offer religious services through the radio, transmission in life through the Internet or television, while others offer rooms to pray from the car.

The casinos and other game places in the whole world were closed and online poker tours were posted or cancelled.
This caused many employees to return to the Internet, many online sites informed significant increases in their rates of new inscriptions. The entertainment industry has also been affected, several musical groups suspended or canceled conciers.
Many big teachers, such as Broadway, also suspended all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work through the Internet as an alternative to traditional life spectrum, such as concert transmissions or the creation of "festives" on the Internet, so that artists interpret, distribute or publicize their work.
Online, numerous internet ms have been distributed on the coronavirus, since many react to humor and distraction through the uncertainty.
Since the COVID breast, a increase in prejudiciation, xenophobia and racism has been observed towards Chinese and Asian descendants, and to people in Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asian region and the Pacific.
Reports of February (when most of the cases still were limited to China) have documented racist feelings in several groups around the world that expressed that Chineses were merely for the virus or that were receiving what they considered a fair reprise.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in ancient feelings.
Many residents of Whan and Hubei have informed discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have been supported, both on the Internet and outside it.
After the progress of the brochure towards new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first European country who experienced a serious COVID 19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. The citizens of countries such as Malea, New Zealand, Singapur and South Korea, at the beginning signed requests to achieve the prohibition of Chinese income to their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been trend on Twitter.
China, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and in the United States, has informed more racist insults, in addition to aggressions.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized by referring to the coronavirus as the "China Virus", a word that many critics considered racist and ancient China.

The laboratory tests for the respiratory disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those who detect the antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of virus in the samples is confirmed by testing polymerase reaction with inverse transcriptase, which detects the ARN of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus ARN.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for diagnosis and population surveillance.
The antibodies tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had too weak symptoms as to inform them or were asintomatic.
From the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Because of the limited tests, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of virus in its population.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
It is also likely that this variability is significantly affected by the letality rates for information, which may be very overestimated in some countries.
Through the reaction of polymerarasis with reverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained by several methods, including nazopharinge hypotheses or spot samples.
The results are generally available within a period of some hours up to 2 days.
The test of reaction in the polymerarase with inverse transcriptase carried out with faringeous hyophodes is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Afterwards, the virus may disappear in the gargant, but it continues to be multiplied in the pulmones.
In persons infected to which the test is carried out in the second week as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the breathing ways by cutting, or the material that is issued by toser (spot).
One of the first tests of polymerrase reactions was developed in Charity, Berlin, in January 2020, using the polymera chain reaction in real time transversal (rRT-PCR) and was the base of the 250 000 Kit distributed by the World Health Organization (OMS).
On 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean Corea of Korea has developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the reaction of clinical polymerarasis (PowerChek Coronavirus).
Search the "E" gen shared by all betacoronavirus and the specific SARS-CoV-2 gen RdRp. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies in obtaining emergency use of the National Medical Products Administration of China with a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the polymera cabin reaction. In the United States, the Headquarters for Control and Prevention of Nurse (CDC) are distributing its reaction diagnostic panel in the field of polymera with inverse scripts for the new coronavirus (2019-19) to the public health works of the International Resource Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits generated unconcluded results because of defectuous reactions, and a succumb to testing in the CDC in Atlanta, as a result, less than 100 samples per day in February 2020.
The reliability of the two components used was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only from then the state and local laboratories were allowed to start carrying out tests.
The Food and Medicine Administration approved the test under an emergency authorisation, and the US Trade Laboratory began to test at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorrp announced the availability at the national level of COVID-19 tests based on the reaction of polymerase with inverse transcripture.
Similarly, on 9 March 2020, these diagnosis have provided tests for COVID-19 at national level.
No limits were announced in the quantity; the collection of specimens and processing should be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Attention Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the adoption of the FAF for a test that could be performed within a large period of 3,5 hours, which allowed a machine to perform about 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorisation for Abbott Laboratory for a testing in the m2000 system of Abbott; previously, the FDA had issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepty received the FDA emergency use authorisation for a test which delays about 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a test using the isothermal-wide technology of nuclear acids instead of polymerara reaction.
Since this does not require a series of different temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Today, there are around 18 000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott intended to increase the production to perform 50 000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is developed that uses a monoclonal antibodies which is specifically a protein of the new coronavirus (protein N) of a new coronavirus, with hope that it can provide results within a period of 15 to 20 minutes as a fast test for the influence.
In March 2020, the review of the publications concluded that "torax radiographies have little diagnostic value in the first stages, while the results of the TC [computered tomography] can be obtained even before the symptoms appear."
The typical features in the TC include bilateral multi-lobare opportunities with a peripheral, asymmetric and later distribution.
As the illness progress is developed, subscriptive domain, enclosure and consolidation is developed.
According to a study carried out in Whan, in the point of origin of the current pandemic, which compared the reaction in the polymerase chain with computerized tomography, the computer-tomography is much more sensible than the reaction in polymerase chain, although less specific, and many of the features in images correspond to the processes of other diseases and neumonies.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends "not use the computerized tomography as a method of detection and as a test of first line to diagnose COVID-19." From March 2020, CDC recommends the reaction in polymera channel as an initial review.
part of the reaction of the immune system to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the appearance of symptoms, to determine immunity and population surveillance.
Automatized high performance systems in many clinical laboratorys can perform these analysis, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratory analysis, generally one specimen of peripheral blood is used, although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For the tests on the attention point, generally one single type of blood is obtained by a punishment in the skin.
Unlike polymerrase reaction methods, it is not necessary for an extraction step before the analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provided notification to the Agency as corresponding, and therefore now they can distribute their antibodies tests.
On April 7, 2020, only a test was approved by the FDA in an emergency use permit. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical diagnostic diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received the approval of Europe for their test kits, which can detect the IgG and IgA anti-virus in blood samples.
Test performance capacity is of several hundred samples in the time period and therefore is much speed than the conventional reaction test of viral ARN polymerasie.
The antibodies, generally, may be detected 14 days after the infection begin. At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom found that no of the anticorps test kits was sufficiently good as to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program where suspected patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives to the patient a tube for sperm," the patient is infected in the tube, sent it and obtains a result at a short time. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspect cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient infectes others if he goes to the hospital or the need to defeat an ambulance if it is used. In the tests in suspect drive-through centres for COV-19 cases, a health professional shows the appropriate precautions.
The drive-through centres have helped South Korea to make some of the most rapid and broader tests in any country. In Germany, the National Medical Medical Association of Health Insurance Association said on 2 March that there was a capacity for approximately 12 000 tests per day in the ambulatory environment and that 10 700 people were tested in the past week.
Health insurance expends costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the President of the Instituto Robert Koch, Germany has a general capacity to make 160 000 tests per week.
On March 19, tests were offered through the drive-through system in several large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only the positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, at the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples had been analyzed, until and including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6,9%) were positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers of the Technion Institute and the Hospital Rambam have developed and tried a method to analyze samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping the samples and only to analyze if the combinated sample was positive. On February 5, 2020, the BGI inaugued a emergency laboratory of 2000-foods called "Hu-Yan" (Hu-N): "Fourniture" or "Fourth" in Whaw, the "10."
With the construction, which was supervised by the BGI founder, Wang Jian, and led 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47 per cent higher and that the corresponding costs to address the quarentee were doubled without this capacity for testing.
After the Whan laboratory, the Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjín, Pekin and Shanghái, in a total of 12 cities in China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily production was 50 000 tests per day. Multiplexed source designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow to evaluate up to 1122 patients samples for COVID19 using only 93 analysis. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratorys without the need to use liquid manipulation robots.
For March, the lack and the insufficient reacting amounts affected the massive tests in the European Union and the United States.
This brought some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that implies to calendar samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release ARN's genus to make more tests. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates now had made more evidence of coronavirus detectation by person in their population than any other country, and was intended to increase the level of tests to shoot the majority of the population.
This has been achieved through the combination of the drive-through capacity and the purchase of a massive production laboratory at the population level of Group 42 and BGI (which was based on its emergency detection laboratory in China).
The laboratory is able to perform decades of thousands of reaction tests in the polymerara chain with an inverse transcripta per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Several test forms have been developed to address different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to manufacture kits that sent to countries of low income that had no resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Control Centres and the Prevention of Nurses was not available until 28 January, which was delayed the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the fiavyness of the test kits on the principles of broth, and these countries and Australia had not been able to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of test health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that the great availability of trials in South Korea helped to reduce the propagation of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea achieved its capacity for testing, mainly in private sector laboratories, in the transition of several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested an increase in test performance programmes such as the best way to reduce the advancement of COVID pandemic. The high demand of evidence due to the broad diffusion of the virus occurred a delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in the private laboratorys of the United States and the supply of hisopotic and chemical reactions were exhausted.
In March 2020, China informed problems with the exactness of his test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC were "defects"; then the Government removed the bureaucratic barriers that had avoided the performance of private tests. Spain purchased test kits to the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd but obtained the necessary results.
The company explained that the wrong results could be the wrong collection of samples or the wrong use of kits.
The Spanish Ministry said he would remove the wrong results and replace them by a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Checa Republic purchased to China were wrong results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million Kits to China that resulted in impossibilities.
The first Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they were shocked to Danubio. Atesh Kara, the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey purchased to China had a "high error tax" and did not "stand them". The United Kingdom purchased 3,5 million test kits in China, but at the beginning of April 2020 announced that they did not serve.
Exercises complemented by the quarter of those who received positive results and the identification of those with whom they had been able to contact in SARS-CoV-2 have occurred satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vó, where the first death of COVID-19 was occurred in Italy, conducted two test rounds throughout the population of about 3400 people, with some ten different days.
Nearly half of those who obtained positive results had no symptoms, and all the cases identified were placed in quarennium.
With the limitation of travels in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With the intensive attraction of contacts, travel restrictions from the outside, testing and quarter, coronavirus 2020 pandemia in Singapore has been much lower than in other developed countries, but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the closing of restaurants and minorist institutions.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore began to recommend residents to stay in their homes, but schools returned to open at time after the celebration of March 23.
Other countries have also controlled pandemia with the intensive attraction of contacts, travel restrictions, testing and 40, but with less strict confinements such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have made more evidence, in relation to the amount of death, have letality rates for very lower cases, probably because these countries have more ability to detect those who have only weak symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have capacity to carry out tests and have national experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first 10 negative samples for COVID-19 to some of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to confirm tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive as % of tests" column is influenced by country testing policy.
A country that only performs tests in the hospital income will have a higher number of positive evidence as % of evidence than a country that performs evidence in all citizens, whether symptoms or not, other issues are equal.
The lavage of hands, also known as hand hygiene, is the action to lavail hands with the purpose of eliminating suicide, fat, microorganism or other unwanted substances.
The lavage of hands with jabon constantly in certain "critical thoughts" during the day predicts the propagation of many diseases, for example, diarrea and collier, which are transmitted by fecal-oral way.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as grip or common refrigeration, for example, if hands are not lacked before they touch their eyes, narrow or mouth (i.e. muscles).
The five critical moments during the day in which the hands are important to be laid with jabin include: before and after the defectation, after cleaning the cow of a child or changeing pupils, before feeding a child before eating and before and after preparing a crude meat, fishing or bird meat.
If no water or jabon is available, hands can be cleaned with cenizes. The World Health Organization recommends to lay hands:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after care for a nursing person.
After changing pupils or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After smiling the nase, tosher or exornate.
After touching animals, food for animals or animal disasters.
The medical hygiene of hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
The lavage of hands before administration of medicines or medical care may prevent or minimise the propagation of diseases.
The main medical goal of hand lavage is to eliminate pathogenes (bacteria, virus or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemical substances that may cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or working in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
The lavage of hands has many benefits for health, including minimizing the propagation of the influenza, coronavirus and other infected diseases; preventing diarrhoea infectious causes; decrease respiratory infections;
and reduce child mortality rates in homebirds.
A study carried out in 2013 showed that improvements in hand lavage practices can generate small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and diarree diseases may be reduced by the introduction of simple behavior changes, such as hands with jabon.
This simple action may reduce almost 50 % the mortality rate for these diseases.
Hand lavage interventions can reduce diarrhoe episodes in almost third part, and this is similar to providing potable water in the areas of low income.
48% of diarrhoe episode reductions can be related to the lavage of hands with jabine. The lavage of hands with jabin is the most effective and economic way to prevent the diarrea and respiratory infections, such as automatically adopted in homes, schools and communities throughout the world.
Neumonia, a significant acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and the lives of a estimated amount of 1.8 million children per year are covered.
Diarea and joint neumony are almost 3,5 million children’s deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, converting hands with jabon before you eat and after using the bath to a rare habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce almost half the deaths by diarrhoe and a fourth part of the deaths by acute respiratory infections.
In general, hand lavage is integrated with other hygiene-related interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The lavage of hands is also protected against impetition, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of the lavage of hands is that their frequencies performance can cause cutaneous damage because of the skin consequence.
According to a Danish study carried out in 2012, the excessive hand lavage may cause a cutaneous infection that causes picassoon and makes sketches of skin become known as hands eczem or dematitis of hands, which is particularly frequent in health workers.
The lavage of too frequent hands is also considered as one of the symptoms of the obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day in which the lavage of hands with jabin is important to reduce the oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (orinar, defender), after cleaning the cup of a child (painary change), before feeding a child, before eating and before/or preparing or handling a crude meat, fishing or bird meat.
Other cases in which the lavage technique should be practiced to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treatment of a cut or a wound; after exhorning, touching or sounding the nase; after touching animals or handling animals; and after touching skin.
In many countries, there is a low level of lavage of hands with jabón.
A study on hand lavage in 54 countries held in 2015 concluded that in the meantime 38.7% of the families practiced hands with Japan. A 2014 study indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest level of 97%; the United States was near to half of 77%; and China had the lower rate with 23%. Today, there are various methods for change of behaviors, to increase the adoption of the use of hands with Japan in the critical moments.
The "essential health-care program" implemented by the Department of Education of Filipinas is an example of action to promote child health and education.
Due times a year, in addition to lavaging hands with jabon every day, the dens to daily with fluorur are the basis of this national programme.
It has also been immediately implemented in Indonesia.
The elimination of the microorganisms of the skin improves when adding to jabone or detergent water.
The main action of jabons and detergents is to reduce the barriers for solution and to increase solution.
The only water results in inefficient to clean the skin because fat and proteins, which are components of organic material, are not easily dissolved in the water.
However, a reasonable water flow facilitates cleaning.
The solid jabine, because of its reuseable nature, can contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of bacteria of the contaminated jabon concluded that transfer is unlikely, since bacteria are injured with the spum.
Even so, CDCs say "that's preferable the liquid jabine with controls for dispensation that do not imply use the hands".
Antibacterial jabons have been intensely promoted to aware health public.
There are no evidence to demonstrate that the use of the recommended desinfects or anticeptics remain resistant to natural antibiotics.
However, antibacterial jabons contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which have an extensive list of resistant organisms.
Thus, even if antibacterial jabons do not preserve antibiotic cepas resistant to antibiotics, they may not be so effective as it is promoted.
In addition to the surfacting and protecting skin, the formulal sophisticate can contain acids (actic actic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) and pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobic activity and more additive for the skin (aloe, vitamins, mentol, vegetable extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the Oregon Public Health School has indicated that common jabons are so effective as the antibacteris for the consumptor who contains triclos to prevent diseases and eliminate the bacteria of hands.
The pleasant water for lacquering the hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
bacteria grows much more faster than body temperature (37 °C).
However, the yellow tibia water is more efficient than the cold water to remove natural oils that retain land and bacteria.
However, in contrast to popular faith, scientific studies have demonstrated that the use of Tibia water does not have any effect on the reduction of microbiological load in the hands.
A desinfectant for hands or antiseptics for hands is a non-water agent for the hygiene of the hands.
At the end of 1990 and at the first part of the 21th century, hygiene agents for waterless hands and with frozen alcohol (as also known as a solution for hands of alcohol to frozen, antiseptic solution for hands to frozen or desinfects for hands) began to purchase popularity.
The majority is based on isopropyl or etanol alcohol formulated with a speeding agent like carbon (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or humidant as glucerin in a liquid, or spumb for easy use and to reduce the effect of resequence of alcohol.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity. The desinfectants for hands containing 60 to 95% alcohol at least eliminate genes effectively.
Alcohol desinfectants eliminate bacteria, resistant several medicines (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some virus (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and hungry.
Alcohol desinfectants that contain 70% of alcohol are 99.97% (reducing 3,5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after the application and 99.99% to 99.99% to 99.999% (reducing 4 to 5 logaritmos) of bacteria in the hands of 1 minutes after the application.
Desinfectants for alcohol hands are practically inefficient against norovirus (or Norwalk), the most frequent cause of contagious gastroenteritis. It must be used sufficient solutions for anti-septic hands or at the base of alcohol to frozen, such as humide or cover completely both hands.
The palm and the smell of both hands, between the dents and the extreme of all dents shall be frozen for about 30 seconds until the liquid, the smuggle or the glass are settled.
The fingers should also be laid down well, frozen them in both palms. The United States Control and Prevention of Nurses recommend hands landing before the desinfectants for hands to flee, especially when the hands are visiblely sweet.
The increased use of these agents is based on its use facility and the rapid activity of the elimination of microorganisms; however, it should not be used as a replacement of suitable hands except that it is not available from water or jabin.
The frequency use of desinfectants for alcohol hands can reselect the skin, unless they add emotic or hydroactive for the skin to the formula.
Alcohol sequency effects can be reduced or eliminated by addiction of glucerine or other emotics to the formula.
In clinical trials, the desinfectants for alcohol hands containing emotics caused a irritation and sequence of the skin significantly lower than jabons or antimicrobic detergentes.
Allergic dematite per contact, urticary syndrome by contact or hypersensibility to alcohol or additives present in solutions for the base of alcohol for frozen hands are very few.
The smallest tendency to cause irritating dematite by contact resulted attractive in comparison with the lavage of hands with water and jabon.
Despite their effectiveness, without water agents do not eliminate the organic material of the hands, but simply desinfect them.
For this reason, the desinfects for hands are not so effective as water and jabon to prevent the propagation of many pathogens, since pathogens remain in their hands.
The efficiency of alcoholless hands depends on largely the ingredients and the form, even historically, has been much less than alcohol and alcohol solutions to frozen.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalconium chlorure have persistent and accumulative antimicrobial activity after application, at the different level of alcohol, whose effectiveness decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low income communities cannot buy jabon and use in changing cenizons or land.
Cenizas or land can be more efficient than the only water, but less effective than the jabon.
A concern is that, if the earth or cenizes are contaminated with microorganisms, this can increase the propagation of diseases instead of reducing it.
Like the jabon, the census is also a desinfective agent, since, in contact with water, it forms an alcaline solution.
WHO recommended use of skin or sand as an alternative to jabin when it was not available.
The correct technique for the lavage of hands recommended by the United States Control Centres and the Prevention of Nurses to prevent transmission of diseases include the following steps:
Turn your hands with a tiny or cold water.
The flowing water is recommended because the water samples can be contaminated, while the temperature of the water appears does not make any difference.
The hands are broken to form a spum with a generous amount of jabin, including the hands of the hands, between the fingers and under the skins.
The jabon removes the skin gems, and the studies indicate that people are most thrilling the hands when they use jabnon when they use the water alone.
Return for at least 20 seconds.
Restrict creating friction, which helps to remove skin gems, and restrict for longer periods to remove more germs.
Jump well with flowing water.
Jumping in a vessel can again pollute your hands.
Search with a clean tube or let the air smell.
Hume and smooth hands are again contaminating with more facility. The parts that are more often forgotten are pulling, munching, areas between the dogs and under the skins
The artificial skins and the smalt of discharged skins can accommodate microorganisms.
It is often recommended that humble lotion should be avoided by hands; skin skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate the lavage of hands when there is no flowing water or jabine, for example, to spend water from a swimming bid, or to use suitable or if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to eat water, such as "hospital griffles" and other economic options.
A cabin grip is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jar of a sog and a swimming palm with the feet to see a small amount of water on the hands and a bar jabon.
The effective hand sequence is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a certain debate on the way of the public baths most effective.
There are more investigations that indicate that paper tubes are much more hygienical than electric hand sequentors that are in many baths.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study by the European Paper Toilets Industry Association, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, warm air sequencies and the most modern air shooters.
After wearing and shrinking hands with the heat air sequentor, it was found that the total volume of bacteria in average increased 194 per cent in the eggs and 254 per cent in the palms.
The air chorr secator is a mean increase in the total volume of bacteria of 42% in the eyemas of the deep and of 15% in the palms.
After wearing and pulling hands with a paper tube, the total volume of bacteria was averagely reduced by 76% in the eggs of the teeth and 77% in the palms. Scientists also performed evidence to determine whether there was a cross-contamination possibility of other bathroom users and the environment of the bathroom as a result of each type of sequence method.
The air crystor, which swears air from a speed unit, as it is stated, from 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), slowed the hands and unit microorganisms and potentially polluted other bathroom users and the bathroom environment to a distance up to 2 m.
The use of a warm air sequentor propaged microorganisms up to 0.25 meters of distance from the secator.
Paper towels did not demonstrate significant propagation of microorganisms, and in 2005, in a TÜV product and environmental study, different hand sequence methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the bacteria count after the hand box were observed:
There are many manufacturers of different hands sequentors, and hand sequentors have been compared with paper towels.
The hands with desinfect tolls for hands are an alternative during the trips when there is no water or jabin.
The desinfect for alcohol hands must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The hands of the doctors have become too obligatory after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis would discover its effectiveness (1846) for prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
E-mail devices provide comments to remember the hospital staff members who lay their hands when they are forgotten.
A study tested a reduction in infection rates with its use.
The lavage of your doctors is performed at least 15 seconds, with a lot of water and jabon or glass to shape and limit all the parts of the hands.
The hands must be restricted together by shutting the fingers.
If there are rests below the skins, you can use a snake cell to remove them.
Since germes can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to kick them well and cut them with a clean towel.
After the sequence, the paper tube should be used to close the water (and open any sorrow door if necessary).
This avoids the hands again contaminating by those surfaces.
The purpose of the lavage of hands in the medical care environment is to remove pathogene microorganisms ("hearts") and to avoid transmitting them.
According to New England Journal of Medicine, the lavage of hands still exists inacceptable levels in most medical environments, where many doctors and nurses usually forget their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that the correct lavage of the hands and other simple procedures can reduce the blood vehicle infection rate of 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet in which the lavage of hands and the standard hands frozen in the medical care sectors is shown.
The preliminary version of the Guide for the Hygiene of Hands of the organization can also be found on its website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others conducted a relevant review.
Trade devices may measure and check the hand hygiene, if the demonstration of the regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "5 moments" for the lavage of hands:
After the exposure to corporal blood or liquids
before an aseptic work and
The agregation of anti-septic chemicals in the jabon ( "medicinal" or "antibacterians") involves the possibility of eliminating the hand lavage agent.
This elimination may be necessary before a surgery or around which are very frequently resistant organs to antibiotics. To lavage the hands before a surgical operation, it is necessary to contain a grip that can be opened and closed without touching it with hands, a little clorhexidine or yod for lavage, sterilized towels to be slepted after the lavage, a sterilized sterilized cebolly to shine and another sterilized instrument to clean up under the skins.
All the joyas must be removed.
This procedure requires the hands and fronts to the cot, in general, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to lavage for a long time (10 minutes).
When slaughtered, the water of the prebraces must be avoided to return to the hands.
After the lavage, the hands are seated with a sterilized pan and a surgical battle is placed.
To reduce the propagation of germs, the hands are better laid or use a anti-septic for hands before and after attending nurses.
In order to control the infections caused by stable infections in hospitals, it has been confirmed that the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of the lavage and that very fewer benefits are obtained when hand hygiene is increased by more than 35%.
In comparison with the lavage of hands with an alcohol solution with hand lavage with a antibacterian jab for a medium of 30 seconds, it was observed that the frozen with alcohol was reduced by 26% more than the antibacterial jabine.
However, water and jabon are more efficient to reduce the H1N1 influenza virus and Clostridium’s hard hands spots than the desinfectants for alcohol-based hands. The interventions to improve the heavyness of the hands in health care centres can include capacity for hands lavage personnel, increase the availability of desinfect for hands on the basis of alcohol and written and oral records to staff.
There is further need to investigate what of these interventions are the most effective in the various health care environments.
In developing countries, the lavage of hands with jabin is an economic and fundamental tool to achieve good health and even good food.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, jabón or installations to lavage hands in homes, schools and workplaces is a challenge to achieve universal hand lavage behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa there are very few griefs to lavage hands near public or private retreats, although there are economic options to build hand landing stations.
However, low hand lavage rates may also be the result of rare habits, not the lack of jabon or water.
Promoting the lavage of hands with jabon can affect political decisions, increased consciousness of the benefits of hands landing and cause a change in conduct in the long-term population.
To ensure that this works effectively, it is necessary to follow and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, the Community approaches are effective to increase the lavage of hands in the PRBM, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand lavage in schools is the "Thirs Stars" approach of UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students lay hands with Japan, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, schools may eventually pass from one to three stars.
The construction of hand lavage stations can be part of the workshops for the promotion of the lavage of hands that are brought forward to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The World Day of Manos is another example of consciencing campaign that is trying to make a change of behavior. As a result of the pandemic of coronavirus 2019-2020, UNICEF emphasized the creation of an emoy for the lavage of hands.
A few studies have considered the overall profitability of the lavage of hands in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that the promotion of the lavage of jabin hands is significantly more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have finished giving light or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognised in the middle of the 20th century by two pioneers of the hand hygiene: the Hungary doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "funder of modern nurse".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant eyes called mysmas.
In the 1980s, food diseases and health care breasts brought to the United States Control Centres and the Prevention of Nurses to promote the hygiene of hands more actively as an important way to prevent infection.
The sugar grip brown in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made more conscious of the importance of lavaging hands with jabon to protect these infected diseases in many countries.
For example, in Germany, cards were placed with "good technicians to lavage hands" along with public baths and the bathrooms of office and airport buildings.
The word "slaper your hands" is a statement that you do not want to be charged of something or to share the complexity of something.
He has its origin in the Matteo’s Bible passage where Poncio Pilato was laid his hands before the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but he has become a more wide expression of use in some English communities.
In Macbeth of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth began to lay hands in a compulsory way in an attempt to clean a imaginative piece, which represents his consciousness of guilty about the crimes that he had done and who had led to his husband to act.
It has also been confirmed that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethics actions, people aim to lavail their hands more often than others and aim to evaluate the elements for the lavage of hands.
Furthermore, those who have allowed to lay their hands after that reflection have less likely to be involved in other compensatory "purity" actions such as voluntary.
The religions recommend the lavage of hands with hygienical and symbolic purposes. The lavage of symbolic hands, with water, but without japon, is part of the lavage of ritual hands in many religions, such as Bahaiism, Hinduism, Tevilá and Netilat, and the lavatory in the Jewishism, the Christianism and the wuda in Islam. The religions also recommend the lavage of hygienical hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Jewishism and Islam bind their hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sisiism, Jewishism and Islam bind their hands before and after each food.
Risk controls at work at COVID-19
Risk controls at work at COVID-19 refer to the implementation of occupational hygiene and safety methodologys in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls in the workplace are dependent on the workplace and the work task and are based on a risk assessment of exposure sources, the seriousness of illness in the community and the risk factors of workers that may be used to oppose COVID-19.
According to the United States Occupational and Health Administration (OSHA), work with less risks of exposure has minimum working contact with the public and working partners, which are advised for the prevention of basic infections, including handloading, the recommendation of workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards and the maintenance of a cleaning and desinfection of the working environment.
The work with a mean exposure risk includes those who require frequent or nearly contact with people who do not know or suspect that COVID-19 have, but who may be infected by the existing Community transmission or by a international travel.
This includes employees who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a great concentration of people and some of the large-scale minority sales environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective coverages and individual protection equipment available if a person has COVID-19.
OSHA believes that health care and funding workers, exposed to persons who know or suspected that COVID-19 have high exposure, have a risk of high exhibition, which is higher if they carry out procedures that can generate aerosols in persons who know or are suspected that they have COVID-19 or take or handle samples of these people.
Risk controls for these workers include Engineering controls, such as negative ventilation rooms, and individual protection equipment for work.
COVID breasts may have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may lack the job because of sickness, because they need to care for others or fear of the possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of which goods are requested as well as in the purchasing means of such goods (such as buying in hours that are not pico, by means of home-to-looking or by ventilation from the car).
Finally, posting of articles from serious geographic areas affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted, and a plan of preparation and response to infected diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
Plans are addressed to risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including exposure sources, risk factors in the home and the Community environments and the risk factors of individual workers, such as age or chronic medical actors.
They also describe the controls required to address these risks and the contingent plans for situations that may occur as a result of the breasts.
Plans of preparation and response to infected diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
Among the goals of response to a brochure, there is a reduction in the transmission between staff members, the protection of persons who have greater risk of suffering adverse health complications, the maintenance of trade operations and the minimal of the adverse effects on other entities of their supply chains.
The seriousness of disease in the community where the company is located affects the measures taken.
Risk control hierarchy is a widely used framework for occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk controls according to their efficiency.
If COVID-19 risks can not be removed, the most efficient controls are Engineering controls, followed by administrations and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Ingeniry controls implies to isolate workers' risks without recurring to the behaviour of workers and may be the most rewardable solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures required for action of the employer or employer.
The individual protection teams are considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but they can help to prevent some exposure.
All types of individual protection equipment should be selected on the basis of the dangers for the employer, put as appropriate (e.g. respirators) to be used in a proper and systematic manner, to be revised, to receive maintenance, to replace if necessary, to be cleaned, to store, or to be deleted in a proper manner to avoid contamination.
According to the United States Occupational Health and Security Administration (OSHA), work with less risk of exposure has minimum working contact with the public and working partners.
The prevention of basic infections recommended for all workplaces include the lavage of deep and frequent hands, the recommendation for workers to stay at home if they are nursed, the respiratory hygiene standards that cover to the tube and extraordinary, the provision of paper pupils and containers for disappearance, the preparation for the telephone or the shooted tours if necessary, the disappointment of workers to use medical instruments and equipment and the maintenance of a cleaning and defect in the surrounding of work.
The identification and immediate isolation of persons that may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others.
The Centres for Control and Disease Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory diseases remain in their homes until they stop having fever, fever signs and any other symptoms during at least 24 hours without taking medicines to eliminate symptoms or decrease fever; that illness licensing policies may be flexible and authorized to employees to stay in home to care for a nursing family, and that employees meet these policies.
According to OSHA, work with a mean exposure risk includes those who require frequent contact or nearly six feet (1.8 m) with people who do not know or are suspected that they have COVID-19, but that could have been counted by SARS-CoV-2 because of the Community transmission of the time around the company, or because the person has recently traveled a international journey to a generally transmission of COVID-19.
This includes the workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, the working environments with a lot of people's concentration and some of the lessons of sellers of a major size. Ingegner controls for this group and high risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as the transparent plastic protection cables and the placement of a ventilator for the service of care that the customer can ask from the car. The administrative controls for this group and the higher risk groups are recommending workers who are at home, replacing the meetings of the virtual communications, establishing anxiety on the surgery of the surgery, and stressing the injuries of the ancestors of the WWWs that are overwhelming the infringements of the ages of the infringements.
Workers of this group of risks have to use breathers rarely.
If a person is ill in a flight, the appropriate controls for the protection of workers and other passengers include to separate the nursing person from the other to a distance of 6 feet, to designate a tripulation member to the nursing person and to offer a mask to the nursed person or to ask him to cover the mouth and the nariz with paper puzzles when it is shocked or extremely.
The tripulation of cabin must use decorable surgical guiding to attract a nursing passenger or to touch body fluids or surfaces possiblely contaminated and, perhaps, individual protection equipment if the nursing passenger has fever, the continuous or difficult to breathe.
In the case of commercial navigation, such as crosses and other ships transporting passengers, risk controls include posting via illness, self-exhibition and immediately informed to the medical centre on board if someone presents fever or other symptoms while he is on board.
The ideal is that the medical control is made in the chain of the isolated person. In the case of schools and child care centres, CDCs recommend the short-term closure to clean or desinfect if a infected person was in the school building, independently of Community transmission.
When Community transmission is minimum or moderate, social distance strategies, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other massive meetings, such as physical or corn or food classs in the eating, increase space between pupils, slowing input and exit, restricting visits not essential and use a separate place for children who have grip symptoms.
When there is considerable transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, it can be considered to extend the cancellation of the classes. For the staff of the police forces that carry out daily routine activities, CDCs consider that the immediate risk for health is low.
Police officials who should contact those who have a confirmed or suspect of COVID-19 diagnosis are recommended to follow the same rates as emergency technicians, including the use of personal protection equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, employees must clean and desinfect their work clusters and their teams with an aerosol or tolls of home-use cleaning before returning to use them and follow the standard operational procedure for containering and delay of the personal protection team and the container and landing of the clothing.
OSHA believes that some health workers and morgue workers are within high or very high risk of exposure.
Among high risk works of exposure, the employees of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspects of COVID-19.
These are converted into works of very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnostics or suspects of COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some aircraft generation procedures are the intubation, the tube induction procedures, the broncopias, some dentist procedures and reviews, or the sample invasive.
High-risk morgue work includes those in which workers are involved in the preparation of victims of COVID-19 or who are suspected that they may have it at the time of death; they have a very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsis. Additional engineering controls for these groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnostic or suspects of COVID-19, even when they are carried out aerosol generation procedures.
The specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some environments of medical and morgue care.
The samples should be manipulated by taking precautions of Biosegurity level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who ingress are separated in different waiting rooms as a result of suspected or unable to have COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protection equipment, OSHA recommends the use of maskers for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet of patients that have been counted or suspected that SARS-COV-2 has been counted by SARS-CoV-2 and for those who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 breathers should be used with filter mask approved by NIOSH or higher in the context of an integral written respiratory program which includes tests of adjustment, training and medical reviews.
Other types of mass may provide greater protection and improve the competitiveness of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of protectors, since COVID-19 is a breathing disease, not one transmitted by corporate fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical masker for the ingress staff.
For those who have shown breathing of patients with COVID-19, they provide care or transport without implementing aircraft generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical maskers, donations or protectors facial, battle and gangers.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical masker must be replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the supply of personal protection equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends to minimise the need to use them, replace them by telemedication, physical barriers such as transparent windows, the limitation of the income permit to a patient's room with COVID-19 only to those involved in their direct care, the use of the same mask without removing it while attention to several patients with the same diagnostic, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection equipment and the use of maskers by individuals.

FECHA/HOME OF EVITY: 14 March 2020, 00:24h, universal coordinated time
LICENCIA: CC0: Non-reserved rights
This month, we are in unique circumstances.
The epidemic of COVID-19 shows our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges presented are not previous, but we know that our best reaction is rooted in the coherence, cooperation and global Community construction that meet the nucleus of this organization.
The partnership and concern that we have seen among our partners in the e-mail messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible they are with whom we have the luck to work.
I couldn't feel more grateful and proud that you all are my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation he felt for our work.
They remembered how important it is for the world to listen to Wikipedia at this time and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available for all.
Your work makes this possible, either while maintaining the sites in function, helping our partners receive their payment or safeguard our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia today more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do, but the way we do it will have a deep effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, from this next week, we will make some important adjustments in the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and our chronographs
As you mentioned before Robyn, the C team was gathered tonight to talk about our approach and our chronograph for the next days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we believe it would be a suitable response to what we are faced and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
Moreover, we wanted to remove stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce the speed, it's okay.
All staff, contractors and employees with contract:
Our daily work expectations will be from around 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week, until next warning.
We are not declaring a feast; if you can work in a more normal time, this would be very useful for the mission.
However, the world is an unprecedented place now, and if you have to care for your loved ones, to purchase or to your doctor, our priority is your welfare.
We're not taking the account of your hours.
If you're sick, I'm not working.
Although we shouldn't have to say it, we say it.
It is not necessary to request license for illness or free payment; only reports to your manager and helps your team to review the calendars and chronographs to ensure that they are covering the key areas of the work.
(If you receive a positive COVID diagnosis, consult Bryan from T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with support and ensure that management is both of your situation).
The people working for hour will receive the total payment.
As we have said, we will renew our commitment with our contractors and staff partners who work for hour.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked in normal circumstances.
This is also applicable if you're sick and you can't work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use the work as a way to changing their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly grateful, especially in these days.
Once again, it is your personal care.
What we requested is to be communicated with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt us correctly.
Some works are considered essential.
There are some things we should continue to do.
Site confidence Engineering teams, Human Resource Operations, Confidence and Security and Reconstruction of Funds, inter alia, play a critical work that might require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and change our approach to support the essential one for our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we all will focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing the speed today will not harm us tomorrow.
We don't plan to "duplicate the time to put us on the day" when finishing pandemia.
It will not be expected that I work for additional hours to comply with terms that are not yet realists.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and we will work to establish new objectives and terms when appropriate.
What happens to the APP, or annual planning?
To adapt our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adapt the chronograph for the delivery of our annual planning of 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to the budget so that employees can priorize the critical work, personal care and care of the beliefs while adapting us to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced time during the next weeks.
This extensive extension of our chronograph is largely reduced the current loads of planning and pressure in all the organizations.
We will present our proposal to the Council in the week that we will come, and we will notify the next steps to delegations and teams.
Thanks to the APP team for its leadership in this situation.
State, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week we knew that one of our partners of the San Francisco Office could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautional measure, we contract an antivirus cleaning team to desinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to desinfect all surfaces, in addition to receipt and ascensors that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own protocol of care, using products supporting the safety of its occupants.
We felt confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decided to get back.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in the DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has transferred its operations to an entirely remote environment in accordance with the shared tariffs with San Francisco.
As you already know some of our partners in the city of New York, we have also spoken about a place in Brooklyn.
These debates are still in course, but it is possible to delay.
Some of our partners work remotely for the first time.
Our partners who already worked remotely since before know that this modality requires an adjustment, thus providing the following suggestions:
Limits the duration of meetings at intervals of one or two hours as maximum.
If more long sessions are required, consider the way to select them in the course of several days.
Define clearly the meeting with a list of the topics and send the read materials with advance.
Adopt the use of the video in a default way, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate cooperation and life connection.
Develop a leader to modify each meeting, a person who controls the questions in the chat and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes in a collaborative way).
Send a email message to technical support if you need comfortable auriculars.
Use the repayment of well-being for refrigerators.
Enjoy the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your partners about the distributed work
The RR.HH. Operations team is analyzing ergonomy rates based on web seminars to support the increase in the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This last week we requested all the beneficiaries of Community subsidies to cancel public events financed by Wikimedia, such as editions, until WHO declares the end of pandemic.
We informed them that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could impede their part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no sanctions for the delay or amendment of these objectives.
This next week, we will follow additional tariffs in Wikipedia and other Community and regional thematic conferences.
The general sense of the community at the global level seems to be partly astray for interruption and, in part, relief by clarity and ability to focus on its own communities, both in Wikimedia and others.
Next, the CRT will work to establish a page on Meta-Wiki to give you a space to the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keep contact with COVID issues-19
We will send them a invitation through their calendars for the next Thursday, 14:00 p.m., universally coordinated time/07:00, time of the Pacific, for a special staff meeting.
We will use this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and pass time to connect each other to each other.
We are together in this and we are available to help how we can.
However, you can continue to find the information of this e-mail message and all additional essential information related to COVID-19 in the Wiki Office.
CRT will keep these updated pages and all the information on one place.
We are also working to keep regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently affected.
If you have any question about travels, events, a important flow of work, some covered problem or anything with which you can need help, you do not doubt that you notify the CRT and work with them.
We're here to help provide support and function as link if necessary.
If you have confidential or delicate matters, send an email message to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations of RR.H.
No of these changes should be considered as a abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead of this, it is a recognition that our work and our responsibilities must be adjusted in a way that has not happened before.
These are the measures we believe are necessary to support each other in order to continue working, to give them our movement the necessary support and to provide it to the world the service where he trusts.
Our planned work will stay there for us when the moment comes.
For now, it is time to support us mutually and to make place for the important work that will come in the next weeks and, perhaps, in the next months.
We all need you so that this may be possible, and therefore we need to care and care for your families so that you can be found in the best possible state when the need emerges.
Now, please, lay your hands and don't touch the face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the leaders team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme that is associated with the external surface (cellular membrane) of pulmonary cells, artery, heart, rain and intestin cells.
ECA2 opposes the activity of the converging enzyme of angiotensin (ECA) in reducing the amount of angiotensin II and enhanceing angiotensin (1-7), which becomes a therapeutic diane for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as an input point for cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
The converter enzyme of angiotensin 2 is a metaloenzyme containing zinc and is situated on the surface of the endotelial cells and other types.
The ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a renal C-terminal transporter of colectrine amino acids.
ECA2 is a single membrane protein of type I, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of pulmones and other tissue cells.
The extracellular domain of the ECA2 is excited from the transmemberal domain by another enzyme known as shedasa and, as a result, the solutionable protein is released in the blood torrent and, lastly, is excluded by the orine.
ECA2 is presented in most organs: ECA2 is mainly adhered to the cell membrane of the type II alveolear cells of the pulmones, the tumors of the detect intestin, the venant arterial and endotelial cells and the arterial cells of the muscle lised in most organs.
The expression of MARN of ECA2 is also found in the brain cortex, the stereal body, the hypotalym and the encephal throat.
The main role of the ECA2 is to oppose the ECA.
ECA listens to the hormone of angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictory.
On the other hand, ECA2 scans the fenilalanal carboxyl-terminal amino acid of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Phe) and the hydrolysis to form vasodilaterate angiotensine (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 can also extract several other pepts, including [-Arg9]-bradiquinine, apelin, neurotensin, dinarine A and grelin.
ECA2 also regulates the traffic of membrases from SLC6A19 neutronic amino acid transporter and has been associated with the Hartnup disease.
As a transmember protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronavirus, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus caused by SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus caused by COVID-19).
More specifically, the association of the S1-CoV protein with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymatic domain of ECA2 on the surface of cells has resulting in endocytosis and translated virus together with enzyme to endosomas that are within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the host TMPRSS2 protein, which is currently investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain hypothesis that the reduction of ECA2 levels in cells could help combat infection.
However, various professional associations and regulatory entities have recommended that ECA and BRA continue therapy standard .
An overview with systematic methanalis published on 11 July 2012 determined that "the use of ECA inhibitors was a significant reduction of 34 % of the risk of neumonia in comparison with cases of control".
In addition, "the risk of neumony was also reduced in patients receiving treatment with ECA inhibitors and had a greater risk of neumonia, in particular those with brain accident and cardiac insufficientness.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in neumony mortality, although the results were not so solid for the general risk of neumony."
The recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) seems to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary lession and seems to be improved by pulmonary hemodynamic and oxygen saturation in lechones with acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipopolisacarides.
The mean life of rhECA2 in human beings is about 10 hours and the start of the action is 30 minutes beyond the intercourse of the effect (during) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to the classic inhibitors of the retina-angiotensin system (inhibitors of the skin) or in diseases where angiotensin II is higher. The infusion of rhECA2 was evaluated in clinical tests for the treatment of the acute respiratory syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices to help contact trace in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemia, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") that could have been in contact with a container.
Several applications were developed or proposed with the official support of the Government in some territorys and judicials.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact track applications.
There were concerns related to privacy, in particular with regard to systems based on the ratio of the geographical location of users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to register the nearness of a user to other cell phones.
On 10 April 2020, Apple and Google announced jointly that they would integrate the functionality to admit these applications based on Bluetooth directly on their IOS and Android operational systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore you are using a application called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open code application and will end up to the government. In North Macedonia was launched "StopKorona!", a application based in Bluetooth to enhance the exposure to potentially counted people and to provide a rapid response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
On April 14, 2020, the application was waiting for the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government informed that the implementation of contact tracks was on a advanced development stage and that it would be available for its implementation in the next weeks, and that a similar application was planned to be used in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Also Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether applications and the BlueTrace Protocol of Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geometrical application for patients living in Moscow and have received a COVID diagnostic, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Ingenieur of the University of Cambridge, exposed several potential practical problems with application systems, including positive false and the possibility of efficiency if the adoption of the application is limited to a small part of the population.
In response to the concerns about the propagation of applications of the wicked or harmful "coronavirus", Apple limited the types of organizations that can add applications related to the coronavirus in its App Store to "official" or "reliable" organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed their concern about the consequences of massive oversight through the applications of the coronavirus and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created will be dismantled to lead to the pandemia of coronavirus after the threat.
International Administration and more than 100 other organizations submitted a communication to require restrictions to this type of monitoring.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be "law, necessary and proportional";
monitoring expansion and monitoring should have extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID objectives19;
the security and anonymation should be protected and should be evidenced;
Digital surveillance should avoid excessive discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
Protections should be implemented against abuse and citizens ' rights should be established to respond to that abuse;
The significant participation of all " relevant parties", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be obliged. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Sin Fronteras (Reporter without borderen, RSF), have also published lists of controls.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the continuing monitoring problem by removing the rastering mechanism of its operational systems when no longer needed.
In some countries, the location based on networks was used instead of applications, which eliminated both the need for downloading application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the trail based on networks was approved.
The solutions based on networks that have access to local data are potentially significant privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary that all systems with central servers have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created using central servers only for intercommunication (see next section).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an application to carry out the contact track was used.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected track information from various sources, including mobile device track data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially contained persons.
In addition to the use of this information to warn possible contacts, the Government also made the information on location available to the public, which is permitted due to large changes in the privacy laws after the MRS brothing in that country.
This information is available for the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered the use of centralized systems and privacy protection.
On 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been published.
The trace of contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a large number of publicationd investigations that are remounted at least at 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen of experts groups were working in respective solutions of privacy, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record the nearness of a user to other cellular phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include the decentralized proximity track to maintain privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), the temporary contact numbers (CNPs, which are previously known as contact numbers, CEN) and the mobile contact race protocols and mechanisms for the mobile contact trace for the protection of privacy (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never get out of the device and all the packing happens in the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has developed SafePaths, a platform for the use of technicians that protect privacy when collecting and using the location or intersection of road data to raise the propagation of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Applications outside control: how to maintain personal privacy during a epidemic" published in March 2020. Other similar efforts is the SafeTrace Enigma MPC platform, a company that develops private technologies that originally founded in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses hardware technologies that allow users to share delicate location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, several united groups around which was essentially the same approach and high-compliant protocols have formed the World TCN Coalition in order to reduce fragmentation and to allow the global interoperability of raw and warning applications, a key aspect for the achievement of a broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace Protocol code used by its official governance.
On 10 April 2020, Apple and Google, companies controlling the iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact racing which, as they have assured, would protect the privacy, which is based on the combination of the Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy cryptography.
The specifications of the main technologies used in the system were also published.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
implementing tools for governments to believe official coronavirus raster applications that protect privacy
Integration of this functionality directly in iOS and Android. Google and Apple plans to address the continuing and monitoring problems by distributing, first, the system through the updates of the operational system, and then removeing them in the same way as the threat has passed.
b'The reperfilation (as well known as reposition or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a medicine approved for the treatment of a disease which is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with the scientific research that currently seeks to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and convallery plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemical proteins, each of which has multiple linking sites.
The analysis of these unit sites provides the reasonable foundation for the project to develop an effective antiviral medicine against COVID proteins-19.

b'Una vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical tests, there are many intentions to develop this vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (OMS) said that it was not expected to have a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes disease in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in security studies in phase I.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A significant brochure was extended by the world in 2020, which has developed significant investments and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the genome published to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Determined in April, the requirements of the ECPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, implementation at scale and global access.
In April, the CEPI scientists informed that 10 different technological platforms were investigating and developed at the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the main platforms that took place at security studies in phase I, the following are:
Nucleic acid (ADN and ARN) (developer of phase I and possible vaccine: modern, mRNA-1273)
Virus vector (developer of phase I and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus vector type 5)
According to the ECPI scientists in April, 115 possible vaccines are in the initial development stages, of which 78 are confirmed in active projects (79, in accordance with the Milken Institute) and the others 37 are announced, but with little information available (as presumed that it is planning or developing).
A test in phase I or II performs preliminary safety tests and immunity tests, usually aleatory, is controlled by placebo and is performed in several places, while determined more specific and effective doses.
The tests in phase III are often involved in more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of vaccine to prevent disease, while controlling the adverse effects that are produced with the optimal dose.
From the 79 active development vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020) 74 were still not in human evaluation (mainly "preclinical").
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular substance that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
The International Vacinan Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work in a vaccine and expected that human tests start in 2021.
Projects for Vacunas Development in the Chine Control and Prevention Centre were announced on 26 January 2020 and the Hong Kong University on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, leadered by Hannneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is codecling a oral vaccine with its biotechnological partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a Vaxart manufacturing association for vaccine development.
OncoGen Lab on 8 February 2020 published a document for a vaccine with similar technologie that is used in the treatment of neo-antigenic vaccines against cancer.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and that they were starting the tests.

They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tried in humans "in 90 days."
On 5 March 2020, University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in the Detrick Force and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in the west of Maryland, announced that they were working in a vaccine.
About 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had been joined to Newvax Inc.
in the development and manufacturing of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for clinical tests and clinical tests in phase I for July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Health Ministry announced that he worked with 11 isolates and that, although rapidly progress, he would take at least one year and half years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, Quebec, informed the development of a similar part of the coronavirus with partial financing of Canadian Research Institutes in Health.
The possible vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human tests are expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Previously this week, The Guardian reported that the President of the U.S. Donald Trump had offered the CureVac "' a large amount of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against COVID-19" before which the German Government was decreased.
On 17 March 2020, the US Pharmaceutical Company Pfizer announced a association with the German BioNTech company to jointly develop a vaccine based on ARNm.
The possible vaccine based on ARNm BNT162 is currently in preclinical tests and is expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, a Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have the results of the preclinical tests in April 2020 and that human tests of the final vaccine could start in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of 4.9 million USD in an investigation alliance to COVID-19, including the Pastor Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which leads to the total investment of the ECPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to $29 million.
The other partners of the CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are modern, Curvac, Inovio, Newvax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists started testing in animals of six possible vaccines.
London Imperial College investigators announced on 20 March 2020 that they had developed an ARN vaccine with authorisation against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced a financing of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to combat COVID-19, including a large number of potential vaccines in Canadian businesses and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
More or not at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus broth is produced.
On 2 April 2020, the investigators of the University of Pittsburgh Medicine Faculty announced the tests of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, and said that "the vaccines of the SARS-CoV-2 subunits, which were administered by MNA, were powerful responses to the specific antibodies (in ratons) which were clearly two weeks after the vaccination."
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the Waterloo University Pharmacea faculty announced the design of a possible vaccine based on DNA as a possibly Nasale pulvery.
Using bacteria, DNA will be appointed to be replicated within the human bacteria and to produce inocuous parts similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, the industrial sector and three universities of the United States gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, together with computer resources in Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud.
Some vaccines have no specific effects.
That means that they can have benefits beyond the disease they predict.
Another aleatorized test in Australia is trying to write 4170 health workers.
It is possible that vaccines that are developed are not safe or effective.
Initial investigations to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as transgenicrats expressed by ECA2, other laboratory and non-human primary animals, show the need to contain bio-safety measures for the manipulation of living virus and international coordination in order to ensure standardized security procedures.
Vacuns against the GMO and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no treatment or vaccine that protects against the GMO that has demonstrated being safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications 2005-2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicinal products for the treatment of the GMO was a priority for Governments and public health agencies throughout the world, and there is no confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When the SROM was generalized, it was believed that existing research on the GMO could be a useful model to develop vaccines and treatments against infection by MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, an anti-SROM vaccine (based on ADN) completed the clinical tests in phase I in humans, other three were in progress, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two addenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one of MVA vectors (MVA-MERS-S).
The publications in the social media promoted a conspirative theory that was known for COVID-19 and had already a vaccine.
Patents referred to by several social publications refer to existing patents for genetic and vacuum sequences for other coronavirus ceps, such as the coronavirus of the GMO.
b'The disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectocontagious disease that is caused by the coronavirus of the acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, toss and difficulty to breathe.
Other symptoms are fatigue, muscle pain, diarree, gargant pain, loss of oil and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and start of the symptoms usually is of some five days, but it can vary between two and fourty days.
Although most of the cases result in weak symptoms, some progress to viral neumony and multi-organic insufficiency.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territory, with over 153.000 deaths.
More than 568.000 people have been recovered, and the virus is mainly spread among people during close contact, generally through cups that produce toser, strike or speak.
Although these cups are produced by the exile, they usually fall to the floor or on the surfaces, instead of being contagious in long distances.
People can also be counted by touching a contaminated surface and then touch the eyes, narrow or mouth.
Virus can survive at surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious for the first three days after the start of the symptoms, although propagation is also possible before they appear the symptoms and in late phases of disease. The standard method for diagnostic is the reaction in polymerasis with reverse translation in real time (RT-PCR) of a hisopy naopharingeous.
The use of maskers is recommended for those suspected to have virus and caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of maskers for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that it is not used, others recommend that it be used while others require their use.
There is now no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease was recorded in most countries of the six WHO regions.
Those who are infected by the virus may be asintomatic or have similar symptoms to those of the grip, such as fever, tos, fatigue and difficulty to breathe.
Emergency symptoms include difficulties to breathe, pain or pressure persistent in the skin, confusion, difficulty to walk and face or blue lips. If these symptoms are presented, you are recommended to get immediately medical attention.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the higher respiratory ways, such as storns, nation skin and gargant pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms were identified, such as nausea, vomite and diarree, in percentage variables.
Some cases in China initially submitted pressure in the skin and palpitations.
In some, illness has progressed in neumony, multi-organic insufficiency and death.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 usually is five to six days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of the symptoms do it within 11,5 days of infection. According to reports, not all infections have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic portators is not yet fully known; however, the preliminary evidence that may contribute to the propagation of the disease is suggested.
The percentage of infected persons without symptoms is known at the time and is being studied. The Corean Control and Prevention of Nurses (KCDC) reported that a 20% of the confirmed cases continued asthmatical during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asthmatical cases in daily cases on 1 April. 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asthmatical when the test was carried out.
The shock and the salt can have large viral loads.
Speak in high voice freeer than when it is talked with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that it was not covering the mouth in the tuberculosis to make the cups travel to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally air transmission, the National Science Academy suggested that the transmission is possible through biological aerosols and explained that air collectioners in the past were made positive in the virus ARN.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonal reanimation (RCP) may cause respiratory secrets aerosolization and, therefore, air transmission.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of propaging by the symptoms, it is believed that the risk is low. Virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation is possible before the symptoms start, the risk is low.
The European Heart Prevention and Control Center (ECDC) explains that, although it is not clearly the facility with which it is distributed, a person generally infected to two or three more.
Specifically, the virus was detected during a day in the carton, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and inoxidable steel (IASI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99 % of copper.
However, this would be according to humidity and temperature.
The jabon and the detergent are also effective if they are used in the right way. Jabin products degrad the lyrics protective skin of the virus and disable it, in addition to remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and clorohexidin glucanate (a surgical desinfective), are less effective. In a Hungarian study, samples of salt were taken in a medium of two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of test.
The coronavirus of the serious respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus of a serious respiratory syndrome, which was isolated for the first time of three people with neumony connected to a group of acute respiratory diseases in Whan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related natural coronavirus.
Out of the human body, the home jabine kills the virus, as it returns his protective bottle. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The pulmones are the most affected organs of COVID-19, due to the ingress of anfitrion cells through the converting enzyme of angiotensin type 2 (ECA2), which increases in the alveolary cells of type II of pulmones.
Virus uses a special superprotein glucoprotein called "spycula" (pleplomer) to connect with ECA2 and enter anfitrion cell.
In 12 per cent of the hospitalized infections in Whan, China, an acute heart injury was identified, which is more frequent in serious disease.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systematic inflammatory response and immune disorders during the development of the disease, but the acute injury of myocard can be related to the receiving ECA2 in the heart.
ECA2 receivers have a high expression in the heart and participate in their function.
A high thrombosis incidence (31%) and venereal tromboembolia (25%) was detected in UCI patients with COVID-virus infections-19 and may be related to a prognostic illness. In the autopsies of the COVID-19 persons were detected difused alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltration with linfocides in pulmones.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism by epitelial cells expressing ECA2 of breathing ways, the patients with COVID-19 seriously have symptoms of systematic hyperinflation.
In particular, it was observed that GM-CSF-pathogen-screen T-screens were associated with the reclutation of IL-6 secret monocytes and a serious pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsies, Linfocitic infiltrations were also informed.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect disease.
The standard test method is the reaction in the polymerara string with reverse transcrimination in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually made in samples of breathing ways obtained by a naopharinge hyophode; however, it is also possible to use samples of nasal or spotted hypotheses.
Generally, the results are available between a few hours or two days.
Blood analysis can also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two different weeks and the results have very little immediately.
Chinese scientists achieved isolating the coronavirus cepa and publishing the genetic sequence so that world laboratorys could develop independently evidence of polymerase reaction chain (CRP) to detect virus infection.
On 4 April 2020, antibodies tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were developed, but it was not widely used.
Experience in China with tests has demonstrated that precision is just 60-70 per cent.
The FDA in the United States adopted the first test of diagnostic immediately on 21 March 2020 to use it for that month. The diagnosis rates published by the Whan University Hospital would suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemic risks.
Multiple multilobulary options with a peripheral, asymetric and later distribution are common in the initial phases of infection.
As progressing diseases may appear underplying domain, disordered pattern (seven lobulling with fulfiled variable alveolars) and consolidation.
A few data on microscopic lessons and COVID physopathology are available.
The main pathological results of autopsis are the following:
Macroscopia: pluuritis, pericardites, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
4 types of viral neumony may be observed:
Lever neumonia: pulmonary edema, neumocty hyperplasia, typically large neumocites, interstitutional inflamation with linfocytes infiltration and training of gigantic cells with multiple nuclears
Severe neumonia: alveolar damage (DAD) with divided alveolares exhibited.
The DAD is caused by the syndrome of acute respiratory difficulty (SDRA) and serious hypoxymia.
neumonia in curation: organising exducted in alveolare cavities and intersticial fibrosis
Sangre: intravascular deseminated coagulation (CID); leucorytroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce infection opportunities include resting in the house, avoiding places with many people, lay hands with water and jabon often for at least 20 seconds, have a good breathing hygiene and avoid touching the eyes, narrow or mouth without having been laid down.
CDCs recommend to cover the mouth and the skin with a puzzle when touching or extorting and, if not, use the internal part of the cook.
A suitable hygiene of the hands is recommended after touching or exornating.
CDC has recommended the use of switch switchs in public places, one of the reasons for limited transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distance strategies seek to reduce the contact of persons infected with large groups closed schools and workplaces, restricting travels and cancelling multi-agency public meetings.
The distance rates also indicate that people must keep a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As it is not expected that there is a vaccine until 2021, as soon as a key part to control COVID-19 is to prevent epidemic pipe, which is known as "planing the curva".
CDCs also recommend the hands often with water and jabon for at least 20 seconds, in particular after going to the bath or when the hands are visiblely sweet, before eating and after sleeping the nose, toss, or extorting.
They also recommend the use of a desinfect for alcohol hands with a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when there are no water and jabine available. For areas where desinfectants for hands are not easy to get, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from etanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacteria spots in the alcohol; "that is not an active substance for hand antisepsie."
Glycerol is added as humble.
Patients are supported, which can include rehydration, oxygen treatment and treatment for other vital bodies affected.
CDCs recommend that those suspect that they have the virus use a simple mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxigenation (OMEC) has been used to address the respiratory insufficiency problem, but the benefits are still analyzed.
In order to improve immunity, a personal hygiene and a lifestyle and healthy food were recommended.
Support treatment can be useful for those who have weak symptoms at the initial infection stage. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intentivistas and neumologists in the United States composed the recommendations of several agencys in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend appeartamol (acetaminofenofeno) instead of motherprofene.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of virus, especially in health care environments when procedures that can generate aerosols such as intubation or manual ventilation.
CDC recommends that health care professionals care for people with COVID-19 put the patient in a air infection zone (IAIR), in addition to the use of standard precautions, contact care and precautions for avoiding air transmission.
The recommended teams are a slaughter of EPP, mascarilla, protectors and medical tangents. When available, breathers are prefered (instead of maskers).
N95 maskers are approved for industrial environments, but FDA authorized its use by an urgent use authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect against the parts that are in the air, such as powder, but do not guarantee effectiveness against a specific bioological agent that is not defined in the product indications.
When there is no available mask, CDCs recommend the use of protective cards or, as the last resource, case maskers.
Most of the cases of COVID-19 are not sufficiently serious to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but one percentage of cases is it.
This type of respiratory support is actively studied for patients hospitalized with respiratory insufficiency related to COVIDA-19 and has a certain evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow skin of high flow or positive bipression in breathing ways.
It is still not known if any of these two benefits the same benefit to those in critical state.
Some doctors prefer to use the invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the propagation of aerosol parts in comparison with high flow skin. The serious cases are mainly given in adults (e.g. 60 years older and in particular 80 years older).
Many developed countries have no sufficient beds in hospitals, which limits the capacity of the health system to handle the sudden increase in serious cases of COVID-19 that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5 per cent was granted to intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed the mechanical support of ventilation and 1.4 per cent failed.
In China, about 30 percent of hospitalized people with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanic ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 presents a acute respiratory syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
respirators need to have different pressure control methods and PTTE to maximize the supply of oxygen, while reduced the risk of pulmonary lesion associated with breather and neumotorax.
The older respirators may not contain high PPTE.
The survey on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical tests.
Redesivir seems to be the most promiser.
Although the development of new medicines can last until 2021, several medicines that are tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced tests.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with serious disease.
The WHO recommends volunteers to participate in tests of efficiency and security of possible treatments. FDA authorized an temporary authorisation to convall plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is in serious and immediate risk.
No clinical studies have been subjected to showing whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China started a mobile application to treat disease brown.
Users should enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect the "strict contact" and, therefore, a potential risk of infection through monitoring data.
Each user can also control the status of three users.
If possible risks are detected, the application recommends not only self-confidence, but also warns local health officials. The analysis of the information macrodata of cellulars, the facial recognition technology, the follow-up of mobile phones and artificial intelligence is used to raise infected persons and those who were in contact with South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed the security agencies to raise mobile phone data from suspected persons to have coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarenty and protect those who can enter into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, German Telekom shared the summary data of telephone location with the German Federal Governance Agency, Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent virus propagation.
Russia implemented the facial recognition technology to detect the incompliances of the quarentee.
The Regional Health Commissioner Julio Gallera said that mobile telephone operators have informed him that "of all ways, 40% of people are still moved".
The German Government carried out a weekend hackack of 48 hours with more than 42 000 participants.
Furthermore, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a worldwide request for creative solutions against the propagation of the coronavirus.
People may feel anxiety for the quarenty, travel restrictions and the secondary effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, solitude, health care, stress and economic problems are a perfect torture for mental health and people's well-being."
The disease can continue to evolve with few or without symptoms, so other diseases of higher respiratory ways, such as common refrigeration.
Level cases are often recovery within the two weeks, while serious or critical may delay from 3 to 6 weeks to do so.
Women pregnant can run the risk of combating a serious infection by COVID-19 virus, in accordance with the data of other similar virus, such as COVID and SROM virus, but COVID-19 data are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 can affect pulmones and cause neumony.
In the cases of worse, COVID-19 can rapidly progress on the syndrome of breathing water difficulty (SDRA) which causes respiratory insufficiency, septic choc and multi-organic insufficiency.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation and cardiac damage.
Coagulation change, specifically the increase in the protombine time, has been indicated in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; while change in renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
Nearly 20 to 30 per cent of CODIV-19 people have hepatic enzymes (aminotransferous) high.
According to the same report, the average time between the start of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the CIU, there was a average period of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an investigation of insufficient cases, the average time from the manifestation of the first symptoms until death was 14 days, with a full range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study of the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among men was 2,8 per cent and between women was 1,7 per cent.
The histopological exams of postmortal samples show alveolar damage with cell fibromixides in both pulmones.
Virus citopical changes were observed in neumocits.
The image of the pulmones was the syndrome of acute respiratory difficulty (SDRA).
In 11,8 % of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission, the cardiac damage resulted in high levels of troponine or a couple of hearts.
According to the U.S. March's data, 89 per cent of hospitalized persons had a prerequisite infection, and the disponibility of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates were different because of these regional differences, but also by methodological difficulties.
The inadequate account of milk cases can make the mortality rate exceeded.
However, the fact that deaths are the results of cases contracted in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
The smokers had 1.4 times more possibilities to suffer serious symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more possibilities to need intensive care or to fall in comparison with non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has found a decrease of 20 to 30 per cent of the pulmonary capacity in some persons who have been recovered from the disease, and the images of the pulmones suggest the impact of organs.
This can also cause intensive care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was noted if previous infections generated an effective long-term immunity in persons recovered from disease.
It seemed that immunity is possible, based on the behaviour of other coronavirus, but recovered cases from COVID-19 that later positived in coronavirus.
These cases are believed that they are a deterioration of persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered natural and animal origin, through an interspecific infection.
The real origin is not known, but, for December 2019, the propagation of infection was almost completely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases confirmed by COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, reported as the first date of starting symptoms to 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on 8 December 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and in time, in addition to the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time passed from the initial brochure and the characteristics of the population, such as age, gender and general health.
In the end of 2019, WHO designated CIE-10 emergency illness codes U07.1 to deaths with confirming infection laboratory by SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with clinical or epidemic COVID-19 without confirming infection laboratory by SARS-CoV-2. The letality rate reflects the amount of deaths shared by the amount of cases diagnosed in a temporary period.
Based on the statistics of University Johns Hopkins, the global letality rate is 6,9% (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the letality rate in diagnosed patients (CFR), reflecting the percentage of diagnosed persons who died from a disease, and the rate of letality in infected persons, which reflects the percentage of infected persons (with or without diagnostics) who died from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and continue to a specific population from infection to the resolution of cases.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these may provide information on how many people have been infected.
In the breast in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1,7%) failed.
In Gangelt, the disease was propaged during the carnaval festivals and affected the younger, so there was relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths of COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overpassed.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population has antibodies, according to the blood donors.
69 (0.004 per cent of the population) died by COVID-19.
The impact of pandemia and mortality are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among men in the studies carried out in China and Italy.
The largest risk of men is for those who are in their 50, and the fraction between men and women is only up to 90 years.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in men and 1.7 in women.
They do not know the exact reasons for this difference by sex, but they could be a genetic and conductive factor.
The immunological differences based on gender, the lower number of women smoking and the fact that men have comorbiated actors, such as hypertension, could have contributed to the highest mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected people were men and 72 per cent of COVID-19 losses were men.
In April 2020, the United States government does not raise gender information in COVID virus infections-19.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and GV affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of healthcare workers, in particular nursing staff, are women, and have more possibilities for virus exposure.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of disease would be "COVID-19".
The head of the WMS Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to coron, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date that the brown was found: December 31, 2019.
The name was elected to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations to prevent the stigmatisation. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called a serious respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "CVID-19 responsible virus" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer to both disease and virus.
During the initial brote in Whan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "Whan's coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease by 2019-nCOV as temporary names for virus and disease, in accordance with the indication of 2015 to not use locations in the name of virus and diseases.
Official COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials such as native hypotheses and parts of breathers.
For example, when an Italian hospital had an urgent need for a breather and the supplier could not deliver it in the requested time, a local emergency company realized inverse engineering and printed the 100 valves necessary during the night.
After the initial brote of COVID-19, theories of conspiration, false information and desinformation on origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that quickly spread by the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study did not find evidence of viral replication in skins, skins or powders.
No medicines or vaccines approved to treat disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector are conducting international investigations on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "Sassayo SOLIDIARID" for assessing the therapeutic effects of the four existing anti-virus compositions in terms of efficiency.
There is no vaccine, but several agents are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the receptive ECA2 to income human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are investigated.
First, researchers try to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, is inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection by the COVID virus.
A second strategy, subunity vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that acknowledges the immune system to certain subunities of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this investigation focuses on the S protein that helps the virus to put into the receptive ECA2.
A third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccines (ADN vaccines or ARN vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their security and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an innocent copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes disease. It has suggested that the improvement based on antibodies is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
In April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical tests.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malicious, including four studies on hydrochlorokine or clorochine.
Releved antiviral drugs are most of the Chinese research, including nine tests in phase III on redistribution in several countries and should be reported at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on vaccine and possible medicines against COVID-19 was undergoing several antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, including: remdesivir, cloroxicarbon and hydrochlorokine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
In March 2020, there is evidence of the effectiveness of the remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassive use of remdesivir.
Clinical trials in phase III were carried out in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used for the treatment of poverty, was studied in China in February 2020.
There are, however, applications for paris reviews for the investigation.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of cloroquin.
However, although the Whan Virology Institute recommends a daily dose of a gram, notes that the double of that dose is very dangerous and may be letal.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued an urgent authorisation for hydroxichlorokine and clorokine to discretion of patients treated with COVID-19. The 7th edition of Chinese patates also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umpheenovir against COVID-19.
Previous data indicate that ribavirin high doses are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
The studies have shown that the initial protein S cebad that performs the transmemberary transmemberary serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the ingress of SARS-CoV-2 through the interaction with the receptive ECA2.
The studies of clorokine and hydrochlorokine with or without azitromycin have significant limitations that prevent the medical community to adopt these treatments without more studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytocins may be a complication of the last stages of COVID-19 seriously.
There is evidence that hydrochlorokine may have properties that prevent cytocins. The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in the treatment rates after a small study.
There is a non-allerated national test in phase II in Italy after observing positive results in persons with serious disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a serial ferritine blood analysis to identify the releases of cytocin, you will oppose such effects, which are the cause of death of some infected persons.
The FDA adopted interleucine-6 antagonist on the basis of past cases for the treatment of the syndrome of release of cytocin resistant to steroids induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T linfocide in 2017.
To date, there is no controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for the CRS.
The transfer of cleaned and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have been recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a method of passive immunization without vaccines.
This strategy was tested with the GMO with unfinished results.
Virus neutralization is the action mechanism expected by which a passive treatment with antibodies can defend SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on anticorps or fagocitosis.
Other kinds of passive treatment with anticorps are developed, for example, using monoclonal antibodies manufactured.
Convalent sugar production, which consists of the liquid part of the patient's recovery blood and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus sickness, a closely related group of syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Whan Central Hospital, who later died by COVID-19 after generating awareness about the propagation of the virus.
