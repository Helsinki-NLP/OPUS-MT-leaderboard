Food debt to European inflation
The main basis for the increase in inflation measured in the euro zone is the rated increase in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro zone, the growth was higher than expected in November, after the 2.6% in October a annual inflation rate of 3.1% was registered, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official prognoses have been out of only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
On the contrary to the American, British and Canadian Notice Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not set up the Leitsins, and, according to its estimation, the rate of interest would benefit from the increased raw material prices and the decline of unemployment in the decline of inflation spirit.
The ECB is intended to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least right at the second percent market.
According to an analysis, the ECB is in the swimming pool: the inflation should be "reconciliated" to exclude the need for later action.
In November, inflation rates reached a 12-year record in Germany, and in Spain the rate of 3,6 to 4,1 per cent.
The increased food and energy prices are responsible for increased inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF-weapon notation was around 88%, and the course for soja bombs also reached a recording since 1973.
In 2007, there was also considerable density in food oil and milk products.
In this year, the world market price for raw oil increased to 52 per cent - in the last month, the price per fase of the black gold nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will increase from 2,1 to 2,5% in 2008, however, with a decrease of 1,9% in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months analysts are derived from a 3-percent inflation rate, however, the average average rate of the year is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts accepted that the ECB will raise the interests twice.
Gallup oriented government crisis
After long-term stagnises, the number of Fidesz Sympathisists has grown significantly up to the beginning of December 2002. The party has the largest base stocks, while the approval for socialists has reached 13 percent of the same point.
The difference thanks to the high determination of the opposition representatives is clearly reflected in the participating elections: more than two thirds (71%) are a fifth (20%) approval against the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are surveyed under the parliamentary increase: they are in the total population to two percent.
The number of parties chosen has grown by a percentage in two camps.
In comparison with the last depth point, the overall economic estimation has continued to deteriorate - not yet was the part of those who evaluate the country's economic situation as a "securely bad" as so high (41 per cent), while further 46 per cent of them are "secularly bad".
After hopeful perspectives in spring and summer, the families see the change of their financial situation renews pessimist.
For the next year, the majority of the population has a further deterioration of the situation; only a tenth is a deterioration.
A Gallup investigation conducted in December showed that 71% of the respondents - a historical high - were judged the work of the Prime Minister as "before bad than right".
Twenty percent of the questionnaires have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of the candidates for Victor Orbán 38%.
round 54% do not believe the government head, comparing 27% of mis confidence against the head of Fidesce.
One of the indicators of political stimulation is the number of whom I think that inadequateness with the President could also be taken into grief without a government exchange.
After disappointment in the past October 35% for the remaining of the government and the Governing Heads, this share today is only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) is only a new choice.
After their interest in the people's vote, 60 per cent responded that they participate "with security" and more than 20 per cent of their vote would "possibly".
For comparison: Parliament's choices would take place at this Sunday only 55% would be "security" to the urine, and 15% more to keep their participation for "probably" and, in view of these tendencies, the result of the vote would be decreased.
74% would be against studies, 79% against practical expenditure, and 84% against the hospital day.
In the group of "security" participating in the people's vote, the shares of the opposites of research, practice and hospital budgets would even be 81, 84 or 89 per cent.
Also the most expensive Tesco increases nearly a fifth
Hypermarket in the Budator Trade Area has also maintained the average price increase of 16% from the last year, with the difference that this year has not been increased in the increase of the value of the increase.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In this year, the price of the normal Christmas Corps of Napi also increased to 16% in the Budator's trade trip, however, has been registered in all hypermarket price increases of over 1,000 HUF.
After the prices in the food markets in the past December "dovengalopied" are not drasticly disrupted, compared to the higher, previous start level.
However, the consumers are decreasing that this year is not even available for 10,000 HUF for the last year.
The price of the "Napi" carb exceeds the magic 10,000 HUF range at least 91 HUF in the markets investigated.
The highest price was 10.5753 HUF.
(In 6800 was the price at 6.800 HUF.)
The prices for unit and living fish remained nearly at the previous level, however, strongly increased prices for puttenbrustfilets, nuts and moon.
Prices for meal and bread discussed the data of the Central Statistics Office of Hungary, however, there were 1 kg bretween for 139 fornt.
There was no competitive price rate in the product at less than 200 pornts.
At the same time, the price of two litres of coca-Cola pfunddflasche was under 200 fornts, so the drink costed only 257 HUF.
However, the average of this year in the "Napi" carbs comparison also decreased the most precious, and Cora is the most favorable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora's prices in the "Napi" cart against Christmas prices in the past 15 years, while Tesco and also increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the most suitable goods core of the past year and the most cost of this year was 12%, while the increase between the latter price of the past year and the price of 21% of the past year.
The average price increase was 1.480.00 HUF.
The average price increase in the past year was still at 1.116.00 forent, however, the increase in the increase of the prices at last Christmas was noted.
According to this process, trade arg: Probably good houses could not be so right to decide what price level they should apply to the individual articles, as the impact of price increases on the consumption was unacceptable.
(When the handler plants badly the driving speed of a product, it may depend on significant profits in the price level that leads to transport intensity.)
In the past year, the "Napi" carriage decreased that the most precious core exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forwards, in spite of the price difference in the most suitable corb, only 844 fornt.
These are not observed, since the most precious corb costs of 1.630.00 forint was more than in the previous year, and even at the latest, there was a price increase of 1.284.00 forint.
In comparison with the last two Christmas sessions, a catastrophic price increase showed that the price of the daily consumption items in the hypermarkets has increased in less than 20 months by more than 30 percent.
(This again does not confirm the data of the Central Statistics Office of Hungary: In some basic foods, the Statistics has established more than 30 percent of the period of 12 months.
So in nearly the meal with eggs.)
However, in the "Napi" carb, it seems to be nearly impossible because the price level of the product has already been increased in the worst case of 10% in the past year.
Of course, the meals providers are in a higher position than the egg suppliers - however, they could decline the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trade trip the hypermarkets do not contain; it will be reported by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three households no longer look at the prices.
It is purchased from large quantities, sustainable food goes into palettes over the ladentic.
Wednesday afternoon, in all three homes, there were unless shoes at the Kassa, when the number of customers were explosed.
However, a smaller Customer Frequency is reported by the country, so that many of the viewers could not even reach the planned transfer, not only in food, but also in sustainable consumer goods.
Many places are separated to desinfects
Recently, more than thousand infections were recorded in hospitals that were to return to an inadequate transaction with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overload of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not just perceived to the delay of infections, so the leading doctor of the National epidemic centre.
Many places are shared in desinfects.
A MRSA infection was diagnosed in the Traumatology Division of Yanos Hospital.
The antibiotic resistant bacterium has been found in a male patient in the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection.
However, the lost of a serious car accident was deleted from the hospital, a little later the man had to return with a MRSA infection, and a significant operation was still not performed because of the bacteria that still was in the body of the patient.
Up to 10 December this year, from hospitals 1094 by multiresident infections to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, the leading doctor of the National epidemic centre, Karolina Böröcz was reported.
So many, eliminated by multiresident infections, have been registered in the hospitals with security, but the dark figure should be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were dissolved by MRSA against methicillin-oxacillin resistant staphylococcus areus.
Staphylococcus areus (SA) bacterium causes some third of the people in their nest without that it would cause a disease.
SA-conditional infections (e.g. absorption, skin disorders, skin disorders or wounds) mostly react well on antibiotics, they are well healable.
However, if the resources are too high or indeed used, the good responseing antibiotic resistant bacteria, which are fast expansive in hospital hospital conditions.
In particular, in patients with disordered or sustained immune systems, but also in older or smaller body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections such as wound infection or blood infection, such as sepsis.
According to Yanos Hospital Director, MRSA infection is nothing special, such events belong to the Hospital Sunday.
The infection should not be changed with the epidemic, massive Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is not where it is not searched.
Antibiotic force
"Solf patients are isolated, the fleet personal takes gummi hands and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics required for treatment" - so Tibor Nyulasi.
The patients are investigated on MRSA, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
Rare samples
The majority of MRSA infections could be avoided in hospital hospitals, however, the present conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for the decrease or dissemination of the multiresident injuries, says Carolina Böröcz.
After this infection was previously presented in hospitals and age houses, the spectators should investigate the patients presented and isolate MRSA infected immediately.
However, in the Hungarian hospitals, the microbiological testing is not so often practiced.
Not recently because there is no support for this investigation from the public hospital.
So most of the cases are only after daylighting when the patient has a significant MRSA infection, so the medical leader of the epidemiological centre is the patient.
From the European Union, there are strict recommendations on the application of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also in Hungary Directives for the treatment of certain infections and illness images.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary to make no resistance against the means, but this directive will not always be maintained.
Among the ambulances, or in the basic supply, microbiological results are even more rare, says Carolina Böröcz.
Splits in desinfects
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is transferred from one patients to the other to the most frequently from relief personnel.
This is why the hand weapon, or the path of hands and masks, is a great importance, but there are also significant skins in the hospitals.
MRSA is transferred by a infection or contact, in the home hospitals, but it is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patients.
The rooms are often overcome, the beds are very close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1,5 meters from epidemic view.
As Carolina Böröcz continues to observe, it is unfortunately noted in the financially less well-being hospitals even that in desinfect means are separated, there are few patients - all factors that are to benefit from the decline of infections.
Such infections are apparently less often, in relation to the further dissemination of the injury, where these protection measures are maintained, says Carolina Böröcz.
Government Programme against MRSA
MRSA infections to be obtained in the griff causes illness insurance costs, therefore they will be fighting overall.
In England, for example, MRSA ' s prevailing or inclusion was held in the government programme.
After first marks, the program has been successfully described as published, the tendency of the MRSA infections in England is slow.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the development of multiresidents (including MRSA), and the prevention of infections in hospital hospitals to one of its priorities.
The mortality police office was not cut
In the case of the police head of the XXII. In the case of the accidents caused by the district, the official advisory is now presented.
Attila Morvai, who killed a footnote on Tuesday at an auto accident, was not alcoholized or under drug influence, said the preceding officer of the Budapest Supreme State Authority on Friday, after the official guest was presented.
The Board confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police head did not consume alcohol before he was put into tax.
The former police chief bowed with his own Pkw in the XXII. In the district of Kossuth Lajos, a 55-year-old man who crossed the street to a non-signed place.
(But this is not a mild-like condition - the lenker has, even if the footsteps do not cross the road to the Zebrastrain.)
The footballer has been injured after his income to the hospital.
According to the police reports, the Lenker tried a shock, and then returned his functions and requested pension.
The Budapest State Authority has introduced its investigations to the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police head had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
More EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance Yanos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) have signed three credit agreements in Budapest on Friday in the total value of 400 million EUR.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has granted a 300 million euro framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects which are implemented with support from the cohesion fund, which has already been signed by the credit contract over 100 million, and the current agreement is the use of the $200 million.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the payment contract is also to be applied to the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the rest of EUR 150 million will later be decided in the framework of the expansion of the credit contract.
In the field of innovation, contract partners have signed an agreement over 50 million EUR, which will be previously entered into research and development programmes at the university Debrecen.
At the meeting, the U-Bankline 4 also came to language.
It was agreed that once Hungary explained the details of the EU's financing, the original treaty and possible amendments will be again discussed.
According to Yanos Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed the total of 113 projects in Hungary to EUR 8.4 billion.
The credit rates are connected to EURIBOR, which is provided by the EIB with an amount of eight years, free of provision.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all Europe takes attention to the previously rare Balkan state.
What, where, and who will buy the EU's most suitable market, but who will be more struggle?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently the most popular plant for real estate purchase in Eastern Europe, with favourable ski apartments and houses in the sea.
Among the mountains are the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, the most popular in the sea are Albena, the "Gold Cost", the "Son Coast", and the historical city of Sozopol and Nesseble, however, the real estate are also more demanding about Kavarna and Balcik.
According to the evaluation of Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the countryside is also locked early or later investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the extensive area of Russia.
The main town of Sofia also offers locked offers - trade and offices offer higher rates.
Bulgaria is to become one of the most attractive European golf paradise, and thus to lock the tourists next to the summer and winter season in the other two years.
For example, predicting investmentrs are already buying a great style, for example around Bansko.
Analysts seek to change their life change in the real estate in Bulgaria.
Most buyers are English, but they are also interested from France, Belgium, Spain, and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also presented, while there are largely Russian buyers at the black sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to leave up purchase a revitalized real estate up to 50-100,000 euros, or distant houses up to 5-15,000 euros, which they then renew themselves.
Good connection and accessibility and communication opportunities are largely written, but also close to a great city, business and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category belongs to those who are searching for a Ferendo Kital (Bulgaria was learned in December under the Top Ten holiday objectives of the Germans).
The third group provides business roles to invest with the objective of a medium-term increase.
Real estate in the capital city will be rounded torers, constituted by increasing demand.
Within the EU, the real estate prices in Bulgaria are the lower, but in the past five years there has been an increase in price at 21 per cent annually.
The smoking in the real estate prices exceeds the increase of the store.
Fodor and the six Hungary percentages
As Minister of Environment, Gábor Fodor was known, the experts ended on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 continues to be opened by the ministers on mid-day after official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries have consulted Bali's driving plan, where emission reduction measures are set for the period after 2012, so after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
Today it is a strong debate between industrial and development countries.
The United States have already reported that they do not want to negotiate concrete numbers, but they would be ready to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gas in comparison with 1990 to 25 to 40 per cent.
The other important question of the conference is whether industrial countries are ready to support both the developing countries as well as technologically as the reduction of emissions.
A agreement on support of developing countries was also achieved.
The Kyoto Protocol's adjustment Fund is to be managed by a 16-powered Council, expected to be read by the UNO Global Environment Facility (PEAc e's Profit) as read in the "Piac e's Profit".
Hungary six percent
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment, Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its primary roles in global climate protection measures, and to achieve a new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will reduce the emissions of greenhouse gas to 20% until 2020 (such as 1990) independent of the success of the “the Agreement after 2012”, or not, and the Union would even be willing to make a 30% reduction, provided that other large industrial countries in the world, or developing countries are also willing to comply with its commitments under force and responsibility.
Gabor Fodor stressed that the goal of the States involved in the Kyoto Protocol was only 5,2 per cent, whereby the EU had already bound to a minimum of 8 per cent with its 15 Member States at the time.
The provision for Hungary is 6% reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gas in comparison with the years 1985-87, which will be filled with the country, as read in the press Department's communication.
The use is high on Bali, and the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, at least it would enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the projects of reduction in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow the international emission reduction system, which is also the importance of the IPCC, which highlighted the UNO's scientific climate change committee with the peace prices of peace.
This would delay emission reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth would be more than 2°C inevitably, which, according to scientists, would have very serious and irreparable consequences.
British army spends on YouTube
The United States of the British Army has published an increase in popularity on the videoportal in Iraq and Afghan.
First, the British Airwave (RAF) YouTube has found himself: Settled special units in Afganistan since March 2006 videos on operations carried out against the Taliban, reports the BBC.
The rounded miniature cameras on Helmen are controlled at the air base of Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
Air weapons soldiers have already undertaken 139 income, their "canal" has been seen over 75,000 times.
The British Defence Minister was registered in the spring of 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Minister (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace instruments stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube canals.
Use in Afghan
The air weapons have originally published the videos with the aim of restructuring soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions will also serve to inform the population about the real objectives of the foreign levels.
Such kind of propaganda is closely free in comparison with coherent television advertising, so defence experts Gordon Mackenzie to BBC, however, these videos always have a certain measure of political message, as they confirm the right of military action decided by the government.
Americans Do With Game
But the army must also fight against amateur records, which are carefully processed, also creating zensured records into the network - such as those who show the death of the soldiers: In some hexalistic, "official" propaganda films the highest losses, but the blue sides of the war are not shown.
From the war views in Iraq and Afghan, there are many videos loaded on the platform in use, but this "topic" has recently discovered the British for themselves.
In the meantime, the Americans are going to do something else, namely with the free downloadable shooting "American Army", in which the player can shoot in a more or less viable simulation in the skin of the soldiers.
Christmas feasts with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministers
Instead of Christmas feast, Minister Monika Lamperth is no way: it will organize a working conference that allows its employees to exclude coffee and pogate in 2007.
Some ministers are celebrating with Live music, other sweet Christmas vote with Tombola or attacks in the officers.
Party, Christmas appointment, concerts and buffet - so the power celebrates.
The Christmas Fire has already taken the employees.
The largest Christmas feast of a Ministry will be held in the defence resort, but it is not expected to be the employees of the Ministry.
In the Christmas Festival, children are decreased by soldiers, and the "Mission Festival" family members are presently stationed soldiers, but there is also a receipt for the press.
The resort provides about 25 million for holidays.
In comparison with other resorts, the National Development Agency (NFO) and the Ministry of Economy and Traffic Traffics are employed.
The 4.32 million Forint tear Christmas feast of the Economic Ministry will be held in the future house, expecting about 350 of 600 employees.
The main point of celebrations is on Christmas, but it will also give Live-acts and a Tombola disruption.
The National Development Agency (NFU) has held its 4,7 million Fort Tuesday Christmas at the midnight in the House of the National Justice Council (OIT) with concerts and a festival.
The salmyte was 1 million Forint, the rest was issued for the more than 400 guests loaded.
According to our information, a NFVO department is also invited at another Christmas feast, which is organized by the Hungary Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) farmers.
The building of the play theaters (Vígszinház) was measured for the holiday.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed these information because we have not reached the competents.
What's the appeal?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFU but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Valley on 7 December.
They did not have to pay money to the OIT for the use of the regions.
Rund 500 visitors came to the ball.
The festivals were opened with a talk of the Minister, after dinner, there was Live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], you were divided with: it had no ball clothing or accession responsibilities on the ballet.
The Ministry of Health, Labour, and self-administration are prepared at a puritarian party every day.
The Ministry of Health organizes the feast for employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 fornt.
Mr Monika Lamperth, Minister of Employees, officially not to a Christmas feast, but to the conference for the year end.
It is calculated with some 180 guests that - so the press department - only be dominated with coffee and pogatsche, so the party is exhibited with 350,000 feet.
The Deputy Minister Gordon Bajnai is only intact with his colleagues in the atlas of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas feast in his own festival, expected to be 436 employees.
The expenditure was measured with 2.500 forrent per head - for this money there is a buffet receipt with then injury.
Since the official period of Yanos Veres, the employees of the PM are celebrated every year in this way.
However, there will be no right party position - not only because of the official speech of the Ministry, but also because the party was set for afternoon.
The Ministry of Agricultural Agricultural is a new year-reception on the 20th year, the Christmas feast of the Ministry is now exempted.
A hundred guests are requested to close Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the exit of the resort, the expenditure is limited to 1.000 forint per guest.
As reported by the Press Department, it is a very simple step up to which only are loaded for foreign diplomas accredited in Hungary.
The receipts that are organized each year start traditionally with a short discussion of the Ministry and have been depressed with smilings.
As reporting the press sites to [origo] request, it will not be given a Christmas feast at the foreign or at the Ministry of Education.
On the basis of the costs of Christmas feasts, the Department of Environment could not be given a result at the press department of the Ministry of Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were loaded to celebrate in the art competitive museum.
More forces mobilize for Riesen Streik
The Liga Associations and the Hungarian Working Federation shall form its coordination committee on Friday for the end of the Monday.
On Saturday, a Protest Summit will be held on Monday - on the day of the vote on the hospital insurance law - starts the labour.
It is calculated with strict, significant transport disorders, since rail traffic is closely established, and the budapests of public transport (BKV) strike up to 13 p.m.
Detail on the strike on Monday, on Friday, the Liga Workshops and the Working Federation are commonly announced.
It is also founded by a LIGA - MOSZ Streik Committee responsible for the coordination of actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a Protest Summit will hold, and from Monday all organizations who have joined the strike, the work for uncertain time, unless it is not agreed with the Government.
In other words, the end of the Parliament's vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the medical insurance law, the officers shall immediately return the call to the strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the Strategic Committees shall be together to consult further measures.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even likely that it comes only in the afternoon, or even after midnight, to vote on the hospital insurance law.
The strike starting at Monday must be accepted with significant transport disorders: the rail railers are lowing their work for an indefinite time, the majority of the public transport and more than half of the voluntary companies remain.
At the same time, there will be a large number of locations in a direction.
The call to the strike is followed by numerous associations and civil organizations - the list of participants will be updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations proclaimed strikes at an uncertain time, others plan a timed labour relief.
By Thursday, between the Hungary Railways MÁV and the free work of the VDSZSZ rail trains could not be achieved in agreement on sufficient performances, although just through Christmas feasts are still more people with the train.
After previous reports, the BKV is launched from operating up to 13 hours early at the Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m. LIGA workshops for electric and heat energy are lowing the work for four hours, and the teachers worked up to 2 to 8 p.m. the Democratic Teacher Workshops have launched a strike of 2 to 8 p.m.
The Hungarian Medical Association has a country-wide age at different times, the EDDS, the Democratic Association of Employees in Health and Social Affairs, a SZEF's sub-organisation, the Forum for Cooperation of Collections, has a second warning stretch.
The most important of the four points requested by the Liga is that the Government returns the draft for the reform of hospital security and submits a new concept of social disorder.
The second requirement relates to the introduction of the new pension calculation model that will be taken from the next year.
Requirement No 3 states that the authorised professional groups of access to the early pension system are already allowed before 2010.
The fourth point is that VDSZS, which belongs to links, has not accepted the offers submitted by the Ministry of Transport, and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungary garden increases the State risk
The Hungarian garden, founded in August with the support of the "Move for a better Hungary" garden, considers the Risk Analysising Division of Political Capital, has increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several considerations.
In the "Risico Warning Report" of the Institute, there is, inter alia, the highest political risk "reforcing the already existing ethnical expenditure between the civics and non-census population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic interferences".
The research institution is mainly the strategies of the Hungarian garden, which probably goes to the provision of such a counterparty.
According to the report, this is considered as a reluctance of the political responsibility: "Persons of the public life have left the debate of the Roman Framework representatives of the radical political groups who have now established their political strategy on the Roman and Ungarn's approach."
It is encouraged to enhance the problem that cannot make awareness of the dialogue, and to increase the probability of violent interferences.
The research Institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian garden had not recently been thanks to the huge attention of the home and foreign media, "the image of Hungary is significantly damaged in the foreign, especially in terms of trust in stability and democracy".
We remember: Since spring 2006 the reorganization of radical and extreme rights groups in Hungary has been continuously reorganized, so many organizations called "national self-defence agreements" have been established since summer 2007.
"These groups are commonly defined as civil organization, while they are opening to prepare defence missions (catastrophes, country defence, order protection), under the vocational vocationality of the police, the army, in relation to the State itself," said it.
And further: everything happens in accordance with the methods that try to make different, based on the political and partial threat of the population, political efforts as a civil initiative.
It is also a political strategy that is not only the point of view of the civil character and the United Nations.
As the analysis has to be taken, the activities of the Hungarian garden are also an increased factor for neighbouring relations.
"In the last months, the Hungarian garden was seen in several neighbouring countries as potential risk sources, so some ultranationalist policies of certain neighbouring countries see the confirmation of its own anti- Hungary policy in the development of the Hungary garden.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region," said it.
In view of the research institution, the establishment of the Hungary garden is no single phenomen in Central and Eastern Europe, which is therefore the political risk for the whole region.
As reported, the activities of the Hungary garden with which the Bulgarian National Garden is comparable, which was established in August 2007 by the Legal Extreme National Union (UNB).
In the context of the development of the Bulgarian garden, the Rome's mass expansions found in a town village of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The UNB has adopted the events as well as the establishment of the national guarantee, arguing that the objective of the organization of "national protection" is.
In fact, in the past 17 years, you think that a regulatory "terror" in Bulgaria, but the State remained unfair and unfair, so political capital.
Furthermore, the initiative had been a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As he said, the increased risk of ethnical interference is also indicated by the fact that some Bulgarian organizations have announced to establish their own garden for resistance.
Since the activities of the Hungary garden shown many similarities with which the Bulgarian National Garden is not excluding that the Hungarian Roma also reacts with the organization of their own protection to the threats, it is in Political Capital's risk warning report.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital said on the request of the News Agency: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research Institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published, and risk changed trends should be recognised, the public opinion will be informed as in the case by the issue of the risk warning report.
Festivals are not all
In Hungary, the celebration is legally regulated, so that the practice of redisponibility of the working day has been rounded around a half-year-old feast, but the next year is less important to us.
Also, in the EU and in America there is something else under "Feeday".
The Hungarian legal system differs between State feasts and working days.
Labour days are most church feasts, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we celebrate a new year: even if the last day of the old, as well as the first day of the new year are working free days - the latter is only so that the Silvester feasts can take place.
We have a total of fourty feasts throughout the year.
The State Festival is the 15 March, which reminds the revolution of 1848, and on 23 October 1956, the Day of Revolution.
On August 20, the establishment of the State, celebrated on 1 May, will be reminded of our dead.
Furthermore, there are two holidays in Eastern, Peninsula, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely falls on a weekend, the practice of the "working day" movement has been guaranteed in cases where we would work before or after the birthday only one day.
The price of the extended weekend is, however, that we have to work very well at the seats before, or must go to schools.
When this day, which is before or after the birthday, is finally to be completed, the Minister of Labour has been established in a Regulation for many years.
The rules of law apply to all employees and employees, public employees and officials of the public service.
Except only enterprises and institutions in which the operation is continued without interruption, such as at the festivals.
Today, the work rule is only through the celebration at the end of the year: from December 24, the life remains formally in this country, since most of the days between Christmas and Silvester's time compensation, or the vacation taken by it itself.
In the next year, more holidays fall in the weekend, or at the end of the week, so that they are given less redistribution at working days than this year.
The calendar will first be around the day of work "played on the head", so that people can stay at home as well as four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that the Friday, May 2, may be a breakfast.
The second redistribution is shared with the celebration on October 23: Saturday, October 18, will be completed on Friday 24 October.
However, the end of the year will still be in the sign of the celebration after 24 December everything stands and remains, even if Silvester falls on a midnight.
Six disadvantaged shortnesses in order to fail to work college
E-mails that we can forget, speech messages that we never receive - harmless lies that can't go to us anymore: you're bringing "color" in the daily place on the workplace.
The question is only whether you are attracted to these small inevitablenesses, or make it better for the challenge and try to avoid these misconscious, for other dangerous situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the Marketing Division," says a college.
What's that you've been cutting a meeting?
On the other hand, you would have forgotten it and tried to do it again by calling to the Marketing Division and enhanced you to forget the message (which is the less ordinary method).
Mostly, the matter has been completed with an apologic.
Before you disappointed, you should be able to make your colleagues a real moment and try to avoid understanding these situations.
What's going on?
There's nothing more nervous than if you're on a document, office access or the phone, but it's not there.
Last night the heft device was still on the desktop - is it all right?
Or will the lost ball writer discover about the desktop of a colleague discovery?
Without questions, you should not take anything from the colleagues, because they will be enhanced right when they find out that something has gone.
So, no cups or post-it from the office to the table, because it could take one yourself: no more where you need urgently.
Keramical about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a trace that has already been placed in the world.
Who with who, what did he do?
Where and why?
The information (or confusions) on the private life of colleagues should not be binding everybody to the nase!
And if someone opens and brings us his secret within, we should not miss this confidence!
On the other hand, you're like a grab, instead of putting the present, even if others know the problems of the colleague.
Without reason, you're not reported about sickness?
If you call at the office to report sickly head pain, because you're just feeling unfair, or just want to smile, you should be about one in the clearness: your own work, unreasonable experiences, projects with fixed terms, must now be completed by colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't go wrong with your colleagues!
If you already know that the next day you will not be able to create it to the office, or that something could come here for you to stay home, you should not be informed at the time that the colleagues, nor the chief will be unexpectedly faced with the inconsistence.
Sums, tissue, phones
We are just depressed in his work, but are we soon shocked by our colleagues?
Do you want to hear a phone conversation that you shouldn't have heard?
The colleagues should not be held with sums, songs, conversations (which leads to their heads), tramps, shoots or smells.
All of this can be very disappointed, even though they are not just depressed in a task (write, plans, organizations).
Are the other guilty?
If a project is not completed, you have forgotten a important letter or important news, you should not search for the debt of your own sexuality to others!
If possible, you should not be excited to the chaos in the office or to the colleagues!
On the best, you're taking his mistakes, and apologize if others were also involved!
The question of how to re-administer the error, or to repeat the abuse, is only to take up!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training shoes and beds: Bequem for home, but nothing has lost in the office!
You shouldn't even be as army clothes if it would actually leave the workplace!
It's not to be crazy - you should both be respected by your colleagues, and self-respect that you will be clothed accordingly in the office - if you wish, also sweet and elegant!
It wants everyone to do the right - or how to be uninteressant for others
Stop and go-to-bye, the car was midnight in the all-mortal stage.
Out of the radio, a strange melodie applies: the ring of a gentle, paid with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The time changes to the previous kitchen comes to the bass, and as a real slaughter, a woman's chor.
It's the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar, which applies on mr2.
The home music scenes haven't just cut us in a long time with a qualitative electropop.
But now you see the stau different when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and surprising production from the domestic digital underground scenes slowly contributes to a change in the total image, and even if the garagenrock with its guitar kitchen is "in", the home electroop is a new one under the sun.
Balaz Zságer began in Pecs, musilised himself in the Yonderboi band, before he - perhaps because there are no two feet houses - began to shoot his own way.
The interruption with his project (Zagar) and his music, the elements from Jazz, Electronic, and Pop, but he created only when he was able to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Sezon" of Ferenc Török.
The training first in smaller clubs was known as the largest public, when the "wan2" Magazine renewed its first album from 2002 under the top 50 home albs and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, was nearly the only one, also in the Western marketable trends.
Nevertheless, Zagar and his band "trendy" were interested, but it was not interested in bringing this brand too.
The band has reacted as it should be: With a new, even better album.
The present new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open them a new way, but the title already presss the desire to continue with the years of specher.
In fact, the expression was time when Baláz's Zsánger was still in the way.
The pleasant, flying playing would be well, however, in addition to the athletic character of music, the - to the timegeist and the trends - sweet guitars, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs the songs lived in England and presented with the band "The Puzzle" György Ligeti at the Premier in Millenari.
A song of the album has even done to the radio shooter - the mr2 Petæfi, sent from early to late popmusic, has then set the earners with the number "Wings of Love", which was included in six home singles ("Durch of Divas"), then set the ear wrm.
It's okay, too?
The hvg.hu asked at Baláz's Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new heat takes the question: How long is your music keeps a certain shock?
Balazs Zságer: The term "Schichtmusic" does not mean me just a lot.
I think there are two boxes in the popmusic, not Mainstream and Underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or under-energround music can be easier and inadequate, but it can also be produced only for sales that make it for commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from a honest motivation.
The preparation of the hearer also works independently according to this principle, of languages and country borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the opening of the Hungary and foreign public against your music?
For example, in the foreign, especially western, the popularity has a greater tradition.
There are not only adolescents or Twens on concerts, but also the older public.
They follow the trends in the popusics that pass close to them are much more attention because they also hold them into part of the modern culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public to your work?
Is it important, who, where, how many of your music?
Of course, it is a good feeling to see that our concerts are always more.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, music is not to serve a purpose, but because of a certain reason.
The role of the public is mostly apparent to the concerts where there is already a mutual effect on interchange, but it is only in the unreasonable changes of the moment.
However, it's just that if you want to do it all right, you're not interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's walking as a solist and built his career more in the west.
For example: we're not really going to be his way, even though we're always trying to interpret this in our music.
We see ourselves more than team players that trust in the musical presence of the other and let them disappear.
At the beginning, we were uncertainly compared to our work with Yonderboi, since several of us came out of his band and made another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petæfi, "Wings of Love" is first place.
Many have heard the name of Zagar in connection with this number.
Was opening a little more popular style in direction of a broader public?
For example: We didn't have any plans to write a heat that should then be able to keep the album as an adjacent.
This song is about more.
It was as a final of the album, with which we wanted to solve the clangorgy and some more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why was she just what the guideline was?
B.C.: The basic thanks was to make an Gospel-shaped chor.
Then the idea came to compile the chor from the home musicists.
So the six-powered chor - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikś Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh -, which we then baptized later "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Would you like to have the song exactly, or have the girls reported it?
For example, the number was longer in the instrumental version, but when the material was completed for the album, we thought that this number still needed " something."
The acordenit has been formally requested after a vote.
I've just put the melodie on the same night, and later they learned the girls.
It was practically all on anfieb and horrible spontaneous.
I can remember that I was slightly electricized at that time, but it also needed the "Diva".
With my voice alone, the song would never become so strong.
hvg.hu: both on the plate, and at the concert, the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no Solo-Part (specific of the short Solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, songing perfectly together and are not less late than the music, so it will not only be accompanied by music.
They also stood down on the board.
Is it a hope?
For example, what they were standing behind, it was because of clean technical problems.
However, we did not want to make them conscious of the Solo roles.
In the number, it is also that you should forget your ego, forget who comes and where it is walking, let us simply allow these certain fleets to encourage the fleets of love.
I would like to feel that others feel this euphorical condition we have saved than the song has occurred.
hvg.hu: What was the most important song?
For example, no musical creature work, it has given more difficult tasks at mixing.
For example, "Dorian Gray's Dilemma," in which I play on a concert clavier, or "Rock'n Goes To The Girls," where the Groove did not want to work longer, but after and afterward, everything was composed as a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number of the new album?
For example, this changes with the concerts and also now where I have the album "lost".
Now it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From the Earth" and the number "Nover The Same".
Employees risked because of minority feelings, milliards
Unfavourable supplier
Thus his former employees Jerome Kerviel of the French Bankenriese Société General, owner of the great commercial banka.
In fact, she came to his way by almost five billion euros.
But it seems more like that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do the same to his colleagues, and it was certainly not impossible.
On the contrary to all large bank houses, he currently recognized the crisis on the American hypotheks market.
"He is psychologically weaker," he was to hear from the mouth of his employees that showed him at the police.
However, as outlined by Kerviels, who published the French media, for example the daytime Le Monde, he was a man who had achieved the end of the last year with its business of EUR 1.6 billion.
Crisis not only in America
"All things I wanted was to win for my bank," he said in his speech.
In the summer, he was able to win a half billion euros at the American crisis.
Indeed, the opportunity was that he had been shocked at the year begin.
In February there was already the first news about the fact that, as they were called Sub-Prime hypotheks, they would have been given in difficulty with income-free customers or those who had previously paid problems.
However, the impact on the whole economy should not have this crisis.
Many did not believe it and had the right.
In the end of the year, he had slaughtered up to 1.6 billion euros.
"When I had paid the first half billion, I didn't know how I should explain it," says Kermiel, and says that he's definitely not maintained anything for himself.
During the whole hearing, he gives it that he's false documentation so that he can't come to the shooting.
It was even able to lead his chiefs behind light, even though the Eurex offices interested in his business.
Risk Profit
He was afraid to flee?
I don't know.
"I thought she was satisfied with the bad fact that I've paid for the bank 1,6 billion."
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position slowly.
In the General Society, he entered in 2000, immediately after his study was completed at Lyon University.
His annual content was $51,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant of a Macler, and in 2005 he became self-dependent machinery with an annual content of $90,000.
However, he knew that he would never be as much as others.
"After my first conversation in 2005, I knew that you looked at me.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kervel explained the research officer.
But soon after his arrival, the first great success came.
With the Allianz's shares, he paid a lot by putting a half billion euros losses at the London bombs.
And that was the slaughter - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, let's let you
"This is like a snowball," he said the police.
But the chiefs knew of all, relatively, it was.
"When I get money, the eyes are closed."
But then, at the beginning of this year, the great crowd came.
One day he lost a billion euro.
At a weekend in the middle of January he wanted to evacuate this.
When he came to work on Monday, he wasn't any more lawyer of the bank.
And a few days later the bank announced that she lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they get to him?
Suspectly, he made himself a vacation.
"I just took four days from the previous year.
A macker who does not take a vacation is one who doesn't want to look at him in the cards," Kerviel finally said.
Czechium has the opportunity to come to 365 billion
The Czech Minister and representatives of the European Commission signed in the sum of nine development programmes in which the Republic of Czech can reach 14 billion euros in the coming years.
It is about half of the sum that the Czechs can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion chrones are from seven regional development programmes.
Czech firms will be able to be shared with about 100 billion chrones from the "Enterprise and innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will be fled into transportation.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22% of the funds that Czechs can receive from the fund.
In accordance with the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, the next year will have more than 90.8 billion.
The "Enterprise and innovation" programme is intended to provide entrepreneurs and enterprises to win money for innovative enterprises.
The enterprises should thus gain financing for the introduction of new technologies, for enterprises' research, but also for the introduction of effective organization methods.
In the previous EU-fund acquisition, the Czech Republic is part of the new accessibility countries at least successfully.
Nicaraguanic Court confirms twenty-year-old prison for experiencing
On Thursday, a professional court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year prison penalty for the former President Arnold Alemán, which was sentenced for 2003 for the financial burden of $100 million (approximately 1.8 billion chrones).
But later he was left from the prison and lived under his home arrest at the Nicaraguc Metropolis.
Whether the former Head of State (1997 to 2002) returns to this Middle-American State, reporting Agency AP is currently unexpected.
The President of the Professional Court, Ileana Pérez, will now depart from the detention officers if Germany may have been able to stay in the house or whether he must be in prison.
A court reported four years ago that Germany had regularly moved the government's money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictified and the accounts actually belonged to their closest partners.
Some of this money finally entered into a fund that Germany had established for the financing of its election campaign in 2001.
Budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The State budget is approved.
What about this household is special?
It is the first budget designed by this Government, and it was adopted without support of the opposition by the coalition master.
The next year was still approved by support of the ŠSSD (Social Democratics) because he had presented him Minister Sobotka (of this party) and the SSD could therefore not allow it to stop it.
On the contrary to the lively debate before the vote on the question of disregard against the Government, there was no dramatic matter at this time.
The House of Deputy noted this traditionally fewer, but the most important law in all peace.
It's a certain paradox.
All governments start and end with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether one likes or not.
Budget is an important part of the policy, but it will be covered by the government's force campaign and opposition.
This is a more appreciative topic for the media, and therefore they give him more attention.
A fight between politicians is much more interesting for the public than the useful numbers.
The State budgets were among the past social democratic governments under three weaknesses which cannot be removed by the budget for 2008:
The first is the high part of expenditure responsibilities by law, which is not only for pensions, but also for social expenditure that has decided the "reducing" coalition of ŠSSD and KSṣṭM (Communists) in the last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness point.
The third restriction is the deficiency of public finances, i.e. the budget deficiency of the communities.
However, the major risk is not the public budget deficit.
This budget is public and certainly controlled.
A real time bomb is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many citizens were given to exclude income from taxes, expenditure and bank credit sources for investments, often untranslated debt credits that they deemed their homes in excess.
In the past few years, they were able to pay these debts by sellering massively of the energy and other supply networks that they had received in the course of the privacy of the State.
This source is already moved.
As long as we keep us on official and testable facts, we make sure that:
Our economy has been over a few years, like the rest of the world, a growth phase, whom the SSD is worthless.
This offered a unique opportunity for their governments to arrange public finances.
However, these governments still debt the State.
Other countries, despite some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have made much more discreet than our Republic.
This is a changing that is to write to the previous governments.
We are part of the countries that, in the global measure, are at least threatened to poverty.
As a result, no massive social programmes are needed, which, unfortunately, were slowly slowly slowed in a giant scale over the past few years.
Even if it has been able to strive a part of the innocent popular expenditure that has been adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if it is not coming to a movement of the pension year and to a pension reform, then practically completes any policy in this country, and, as well as those who are in the power, nothing will remain as a clean manager.
It is only easy to overcome when it is said that then, from dominant political officials, the majority of tax revenues mechanically shared on pension and social expenditure.
The budget cannot therefore be a revolution, but only the expenditure of normal expenditure can be granted by obligation expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion chrones for 2008 would be overwhelming if previous governments had not been issued in the last ten years, just what happened.
If we do not really want to be pure administrative officials from dominant politicians, then we must be patient and that nonetheless strong coalition government, which is aware that the State is only able to echo as much as it is possible to take taxes and taxes, to want to be peaceful in preparing further reform laws.
Only these allows a progressive implementation of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to control the crisis
The American Federal Reserves, the European Central Bank and the British Central Banks, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight against the crisis on the financial markets together.
Thus, more than 100 billion dollars will be delivered by auditions to the monetary markets.
In these cases, the banks will increase the interest rates they are willing to pay mutual money.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion to auction, and the European and Swiss Central Bank is locker.
The first time after the 11th September, the central banks of the individual States are to be a such coordinated action to decrease the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step aims to eliminate the greatest difficulties of the economy, and also the growing lack of a free capital available that the banks can give", wrote in a report for their customers Bernard Bau Mole of the Outlook Economic Group.
"The coordinated action of the Central Bank has reduced the probability of recession in the United States of about 50%," added in its report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of non-served credits, especially in the United States.
Analytics are expected to lose more billions.
"The Central Banks have really had fear of what can happen, as they decided to this action," said the Chief of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he said.
The Central Banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have difficult access to their own assets, they will also be obtained for their customers.
This would reduce the consumption and decrease the American economy into a reception, perhaps with effects on the economic growth in the whole world.
The Central Banks have decided that after they were not able to decline the LIBOR, the London interim rate used in the currency between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly scared of reverse money, although the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Britain had cut their interests several times during the birth.
"This will have the same effect as a further decline of the interest rates", said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of the Central Banks is involved in the eradication of the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem, as well as the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Claus: The debates of the ecologs are unbelievable
Global climate changes are mostly damaged by developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed the problem of global warming.
The criticism now focused on the UNO international conference on climate change on Bali on the end.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, no green planet," he explained that the debates of the ecologs were incredibly incredible.
According to Claus, it is not only the structure of the conference that forms a rare mixing of government representatives and such non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the Rhetoric which they join and the reality.
"The debate is unstructured there, it is a word fire work that is only replacement for a real solution to present problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President emphasized the idea of his book that it is very important for him and that he was so engaged.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in the German Translation because "I am often in my views."
So now interested people could read their position uncertainly.
Klaus recalled that he wasn't an air-continent, but he has his opinion according to sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He is finally academic to understand and to assess ability and special negotiations, has experience with statistics and is also a people's economics.
The main explanation of the book said that the climate was constantly changed and that its changes were normally that it was not a coherent opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes were not too large and serious and, therefore, no threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate were to be obsolete, unimpact and inacceptable.
He also felt that he had experiences with totality systems to spend on inadequate, unreasonable views of others, seeing it as a dangerous limitation of freedom.
On the issues of the attendants he repeated that he was not against a conscious environmental protection, but against militant eco-active activists who did not take account of the relationship between employees and contracts.
On the same subject, Klaus had spoken in Vienna two months ago in the Hayek Institute.
600000 people couldn't change their leading appearance
600000 drivers slowed the time to turn their old driver, whose validity end of the year.
Today, the last day is where we can be invited to make the authorities a new leadership up to the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not be afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers have been attributed to roads after the new year.
As a result, the authorities have not, in particular, dismissed their leadership, who do not want to walk anymore.
While small places report a strong disappearance of the interest in the flight appearance, the officers of the capital will be protected with applications, and the interest in the changing has still fallen this week.
The city management ends around 2000 customers daily.
You have to get up for about a half hours.
In Praga, about 140000 drivers have not changed their appearance.
The exhibition of a new leadership is 20 days.
But it is possible to request the exhibition with a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 krones.
Car drivers who do not create the change prescribed until the end of the year and without valid driver, a money punishment is threatened from January.
The wicked one pays maximum 2000 chrones.
However, the police can also be used with an investigation in the transmission.
In case of transmission, the punishment can increase at 2500 krones.
After previous information, the community may also receive a punishment that does not go.
He could, so he called a punishment of even 30000 krones.
The Ministry already called for the offices to leave milk guards and, at least, to put a punishment of 1000 chronics.
The speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, threatened no one to a thousand punishment.
The leadership appears to be a document where every person can decide whether he wants to have it or not.
It is not about a personal proof that everyone, although a valid, must have.
People who don't want to walk, they should leave their leadership.
It is necessary to bring him to the competent community office or to send him to it by registration.
Annual ends, leaderships are invalid, issued between 1964 and 1993.
The drivers must, however, turn further types of drivers.
People with leaderships from 1994 to 2000 have three years for the change.
The validity of leaders issued by 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2,6 million other leaderships.
Judge sent penalties for detectives who were linked to Berdych
The former police Josef Opava and Petr Kośaśík, who were accused of having done a common matter with David Berdych, received 13 in relation to 10 years of prison.
In a legal sentence, the Prayer of the Supreme Court decided to reduce their punishment for two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Peace against the Organized Crime" 14 were threatened for 12 years.
There is no professional possibility against today's judgment, only the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused of this, but first it is before him.
However, in other processes he had already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't be condemned.
A district court in January 19, especially because of the participation of slaughter accidents, the Oberlandsgericht has negotiated the profession of 16 of them today.
The majority of the accused persons have been disfellowshipped from the beginning of the complaint with the foundation, and it is a case built.
According to the Mediterranean District Court, the police members in discussion, including Berdych Prosecutors, information from the sources of the police, captured different shooting accidents and helped members of the band to defeat the punishment.
The bands were transferred to Opava and Kośaśík 30% of the beats.
The complaint has been sentenced by the bands from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, for shooting accidents whose victims often suffered serious damages, but also for official assault and unlawful weapons.
In home search, the police found illegal pistons, munitions with steel cars, a laser target raw and a machine.
The band has resulted in a number of millions of chronics by the accustomation.
Notwithstanding 20 men in this procedure, the Courts Berdych and a number of other persons because of any other cases of slaughter.
Other men from Berdychs around need to be responsible in another process, other cases have not been achieved before the court.
The main negotiations have been held until then to Tomáš Pæta and Maroš Šulei, who were in irrelevant prison and waited for the final decision on their extradition for punishment in the Czech Republic.
Kids disappear - Account: 12 million
The lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, will request 12 million chronics deprivation more court costs for the transmission of children in a disconnection clinic.
For each of the mothers, for the parents, for two million and for the children a million.
The hospital offers maximum 200000 for each pair.
The Hospital Director, Ondśej Dostal, is therefore completely agreed with the Velebas proposal.
"Any of this proposal we deal with, he is too high of a variety of times," said Dostal after today's negotiations.
"But in order to make a view on this proposal, we need the view that made up the contrary side.
We will find whether it's real value.
But we consider that this should be together for all in hundreds of thousands," said Dostal.
The amount should be moved between 100000 and 200000 krones for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jablośov wanted to have a million chrones for each month she had not received her biological daughter.
For Veleba served as a basis for punishment negotiations that had developed for him the University of Hospital House in Prague Motol.
Children’s parents experienced psychological and psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strength and depths.
The men struggle the stress situation better, even if they saw abortions against them, they could prevent the translation of the newborns.
Women will return to the consequences of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is now going on, and Veleba set the content together.
Veronica and Nikola, on 9 December, interfered with the illness clinic in Tåebæ last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the rhetorics in Pśibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Broś and Jaroslava Trojanov to Jablośov.
The district Chauptman of Vysočina (Bohemia-Merry height) overlook the end of October, each family 100000 krones as a replacement for expenditures that were found by the error of the hospital in Threbæ, which was supported by the district.
All hospitals in Czechy are able to be firmed by laws.
In doubt, they must be taken to a reserve fund, only soon they can request assistance to the relief.
The courts have been subject to comparisons comparedly low injuries, the amounts were set by tables and moved in the field of hundreds of thousands, only from millions.
Polivka came to his Kingdom Walachi
Bolek Polívka lost the war about the "Königreich Walachi".
According to the director of the district Court in Ostrava, he used first the term "Walachian king", but the project had built a team for Tomáš Harabisch in association with the player in a long-year work.
Polívka did not take part today in the negotiation.
In accordance with his lawyer, the matter is probably not completed, and his mandate will probably be invoked.
"The war is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas," said the lawyer Polyvkas after the negotiation.
All of them were presented by the words "Walachic Kingdom" just these players and comics.
The same opinion is Harabiš.
"We have a ten-year job behind us.
In fact, the Commission has not been able to deal with the Commission's report.
He follows the strike for money.
"After years, they found that the project was successful and that they could have something.
They want to win parasites to our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his TV amendments.
1993, the player Radoslav Brzobohatī.
However, it was not income with the desire to fulfil a rational Kingdom.
A few years later, Harabisch came to the thought of turning out the Walach.
From an originally slow action, a business and a entrepreneurship were deleted to the Harabiš, then the establishment of the Wallic Kingdom company.
1997 Polívka was aware of the use of his name and signing in the places and cut his owners even shocked when he visited his farm and his theatre ideas.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judges also found that Harabiš was only using the simple idea that Polívka had made public in the "Manege" sending for his entrepreneurs.
"The Polyvkas Popularity has helped the project of the Uruguayn Kingdom", said the judge.
However, she added that the souls of the Harabiš project and its team who had been intensely dedicated to him.
The cooperation of today-destructed parties continued until 2000, as Harabisch for Polívka was organized by the official recruitment in Vsetín.
However, since then, between Polívka and Harabiš began to build the strictness, which were assembled in the "Kenig Boleslavs I., elected to the Sankt Nimmerleins Day".
The leadership was then entitled to call Harabiš's Jarmila šulákova as a king-in-law.
In 2002, Polívka was enriched against Harabisch and his company, which was denied today by the court.
Clarity in the struggle could bring the wedding campaign prepared by Harabiš towards the throne and a half princess.
This should be a new king.
The details and a term he did not want to betray.
"We don't want to overcome anything.
It should be something like the king summer in the Walachi.
The king should be selected for a certain time.
Mr Polivka can also register peacefully with this," added Harabisch.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VT: predominant weakness
To tell the truth, I never was a special fan of Peugeot 206.
His driving properties were not much valuable, which the quality of gangs maintenance, slowing, and also processing could be described more averagely.
But now he is his follower, the Peugeot 207, on the market, and it is much better.
The combination with the name SW is another part, and I'm still only to revise my opinion.
When I had tested the classic hatchback of 207, I had, for example, had to cut me on the too low head freedom on the front seats.
These committees have no longer been complaints, since the carosseries of the combination are so trained that not even two meters of moon are suffered.
Quickly forward
I'm just going on the internal rental so that I don't repeat too much.
It's a rightly achieved design, where I only have a decrease because of the careful media tunnel.
There I would be something more designery, where the car makes a very elegant impression.
The seats are awesome, and over the time, where we may have assessed us about too short seats or heads.
The page content has also improved significantly against 206.
With regard to the Rauman order, there can also be the largest measurements of the carosseria.
In the combi, the lack of head liberty has also been removed.
Coffee in the copper room
The main case on this car is the lading room.
I have to describe it (approximately because of the cutting back window) as a very slightly swimming and swimming place.
The hot spaces are equipped with guards representing an ideal compromise.
They do not endure, let each other and hold more serious objects.
But let's hold us on the lade volume.
According to table 428 litres, which is more average than competitively.
However, in comparison with the most selling vehicles in Czech, this class, the škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we observe that the Peugeot remains 52 litres clearly spurable.
This value is already critical for a foreign holiday or when a child car is invited.
But to highlight the positive, I still have to consider the entirely slow swimming swimming loading space or even the very low slow switch.
120 PS in four lines
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder benzin engine with Hubraum 1.6 liters and a performance of 88 kWp.
And honestly said, so it should look like a 1600-kit-motor that takes a family hatchback.
He's empty, has a low consumption and goes out.
If I compare him with his cocktail at škoda, who sometimes acts like his explode was hidden with a laptop, I can only be shocked by him.
The price list speaks of baths
The price of this car is not just public.
But we need to remember that we have tested a good equipped car with a spacious internal and a very good engine.
The base price of the car with the 1400 benzin motor in height of 329900 krones is still attracted.
With our engine it costs from 410900 krones, which is quite much.
The premium of the test car will be used again with 80000 krones additionally to book.
However, we had head-air bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic swimming solution, electric window chairs down and...
So the whole car costs 531900 krones.
This is a lot, but once you receive the additional supply of a fabian and you will be accompanied with a totally similar amount.
So it remains only the decision you want to choose.
Integration of Slovakia students in British Schools did not begin
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries takes place, with the inhabited concerns to further development of the local school.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has to be reduced by a number of obstacles.
The British Schools even determine the cases where conflicts between immigrants and children of the original population are increasing to violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe to British schools is illustrated in the case of North Kent, where the interferences between local and Slovakia migrants are increasingly.
Streitways, skins and swifts among students have moved towards the relationship between parents.
The situation has been so wide that the police in Chatham found a Slovak woman who had a ten-year-old boy with a iron station.
The accused defended that the boy had policyed her with racial constraints.
The police also had to attack two minor girls on a Slovakian immigrant.
The girls used to make racist comments against the man and cut him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy slaughtered on a bus chair and spotted on us.
When I told him he had to stop him, he reaped us with cups and birds and then dissolved his skin," a mother of Slowakian student in the newspaper The Times described another unprecedented event.
The complaints come from both sides.
One of the inhabited people called the fight with the migrants from Eastern Europe even as a survival fight.
The cases indicated that the stimulation between local and immigrants in British schools is increasingly enhanced.
In Britain, 70000 Slowakians have been reported here.
About 30000 Slovakia students visit the British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it's really a island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will be filled if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea, which is calm as a tea.
Palms and All Inclusives with Kellners offering on the beach Pizza, Eis and devastating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you can find this in a great measure.
Only on a island you can find much more, and this island is Kuba, the greatest and beautifulest of the largest antilles.
At the time of Spain, Kuba was the basis for the United States reception.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place you looked at a human eye.
Havanna was one day to a camp or shock of estimates that the Spanishs in America had built and then moved to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel was located at the end of the 20th century.
Construction was one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because all the crimes in the United States (especially during the Prohibition) were pleased to see and support on Cuba - drugs, lucky games, prostitution.
Among his guests, you were.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, high households were over the large boulevards, cars that were counting to the cultural symbols of the past fifty-first years of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway purchased an accommodation in San Francisco de Paula, near Havanna, and in Cojímar he had been his jacket.
At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the showbusine and politicians left their signatures from the whole United States.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havanna, you can also leave your autogram.
At the Bar in the National Hotel, you will be mixed for you cocktails.
And the cultures of the fifty-six men walk to Havanna until today, because the first imported shoes and fiats are already different in the swimming and frighten air for a long time.
Mag Havanna, especially his older part, has been strongly discovered, nor finding in the circle so many wonderful colonial visions as just here.
Other places are just taken out, for example Trinidad.
With regard to the need for urgent money, there was green light for this development.
In the past fifty years, new hotels were not only in Havanna, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Kuba offers another Marotte, which is unique in the world and is especially regarding rail chair guests.
The sugar rore of disappeared plants took the same skin snare and manufactured pigs to the sugar manufacturers.
Their flight park has not been renewed over decades, and there is a sweet and full-functioning locomotives, whose age partners are in the museum for a long time.
Exploitant objectives
The most important place does not allow the majority of Cuba visitors.
So you don't need to write about Varadero or Havanna.
Remember that in the already mentioned presence of Hemingways, there should be a museum whose visit should not be left from the one whose writer may.
The Viñales Tal in the west of the island is one of the most malarian rings of Kuba.
The heavy vegetation increases on calk grounds.
The mogotas, calk legs and felces, slowly part of the ball floor, in their skin spaces, gathered fruitful grounds, also covered by sharp rock areas of deep consumption.
This is where the best Cuban tabak may be built.
In its final form you can meet him when visiting one of Havanna's Zigarre Fabrics.
Some may seem interesting that there was the chilean consequences of the "Major Zeman" TV series.
Trinity
A urgency city was founded short after the Spanishs had colonized the island.
Ruth and riches brought her the trade with slaves and sugar.
The riches were in the sweet beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has not changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray garden, is a so distant place that there was no road that had been associated with the rest of the country in the past fifty years of the last century.
This isolation helped it to remain uncertain.
Nothing was built there, but so there was nothing, everyone was happy that he had a teater over the head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, you can see interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancon or the "Tal of the sugar manufacturers".
On the evening, you should go to the Casa de la music, who live after darkness, and where the music is not slow until the morning.
Baraco
This city is entirely located in the east of the Kuba, some of the most beautiful islands.
It is certain that this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads that lead from Guantánamo have to overcome high and circumcised mountains and passed through a landscape that is not affected by human attacks.
These Eastern Posts Kubas took the UNESCO thanks to the unrelated nature in their world heritage directory.
There will be the best chocolate that the church shows the cross of Kolumbus (in fact, it was about hundred years after the driving of Kolumbus), and from the hill where the former Burg, the present hotel El Castillo, is to see several tables from which El Y même is the most known.
About the coffee, the Roman, the Zigarrens, the Sierra Maestra assembly, the swimming island and the island of Isla de Pinos, over the Tropicana cablett, the sanctuary of the Cuban Patron Caridad del Cobre, over the Santeria, a African religion, which recognizes the seeds of slaves, over all that could be written.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
The partners in Afghan are passive, the Americans said.
A few soldiers and the lack of useful equipment are influenced by the United States in the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO should develop a concrete plan for the following years, according to the words of Minister of Defence, Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghan did not conclude in their opinions, but in the Scotiaan Edinburgh, the representatives of the countries have been united in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of Taliban sides, the eight participating States also discuss further coordination plans among the partners.
While the United States, by their Defence Minister, Robert Gates, employ NATO units to increase, the priority is to strengthen the Afghanistan government's authority and to intensify development aid.
"In Afghanistan, a pre-development is clear, but military forces can only be a part of the solution.
Another part of this is to allow the people to start a continuous development of the economy and security", says the British Defence Minister of Browne of BBC.
Nine percent
The activity of the Afghan Asylum has reached the highest level for five years, according to the reports of the American Army.
In comparison with the previous year, the number of violence has increased by 27%, even in the southern province of Helmand by sixty percent.
NATO countries have stationed about 40000 soldiers in Afghan, which is about one fourth in the southern territory.
In accordance with the United States, however, the associations are cut into an absolute border with regard to the organization and equipment of the units.
Concretely, they call for further guests, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We're seriously going to think about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly, today the Secretary-General of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop.
"I am not pleased of what we have available in Afghan to countries and the air.
We have about nine percent of soldiers and equipment that we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the Agent Reuters to complete three-day discussions with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In the last few months, all of the partners in Afghan have been able to give them the best.
For passiveness, for example, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not so high as for us in the South and Eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British Boulevard Zeitung "Sun" this week called the German soldiers as a faul.
"Afghanic non-Studies detach: Germans make games while fighting our kids," the "Sun" wrote in a contribution complemented by German soldiers.
The German school period went over to an attack and printed a picture of a British unit at a Rugby competition fight in the southern Afghan part of the Afghan.
State debts will be increased to a million in 2009
On each Czech, a State debt of 84000 krones is debt.
The total debt increased to the end of September at 842.7 billion chrones.
The government had planned to debt 159.2 billion cannes this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan by the improved development of the State budget at 152.8 billion.
The State debts of the Czech Republic remained until the end of September at 842.7 billion chronicles.
Within the first nine months of this year, they resulted in 40.2 billion.
However, since June, they were covered about 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed that his information on the State debts from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84000 krones.
Over the whole year, the State debt over 111 billion chrones.
"After now we seem to be overwhelmed by the lowest deficit for the coming year, the borders of a million chrones may only be exceeded in 2009.
The next year the debts should be moved between 900 billion and a million chrones," said David Marek, Analyticer of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, Analyticer of the next financial analysis: "To overcome a million, we could come over 2009.
When exactly, we do not know the next household.
If a change in the situation on the political movement should be shown, and the politicians should be prepared to deal more, this could continue until 2010.
But I don't go out of such a change," he noted.
Increased Debts
The State debt is due to the debts of the State government and is in particular from the increase of deficiencies of the State budget.
State debt shall be financed by funds of debts, public credits, direct loans or for example by the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt increased by 719.4 billion chronicles this year.
Foreign debts of the State increased up to 1.7 billion chrones to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable State debt reached at the end of September 803,3 billion chrones and grew from June to 13.7 billion.
The average rate of State debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased over the year from the first to the third quarter to 13 percent, which is really much in view of how good the economy is.
It is interesting that adults are mainly in debt descriptions where the growth is 20%.
It is bad that the debts increase, but otherwise this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes", said Pikora the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the intervention of the State debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to include 159.2 billion chrones for this year.
However, at the beginning of December the Ministry reduced the plan by the improved development of the State budget at 152.8 billion chronicles.
This amount is mainly due to the public budget deficit that will obviously reach 76 billion chronics instead of the 91.3 billion.
It is also the maximum fund for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion chrones, a ten billion reserves for payment of pensions, the financing of State debt credits for 43 billion and the rates for the contributions of the European Investment Bank to 1.8 billion.
In order to give a name to a Teddyballer, she was presented to a court today in Khartum.
The British teacher, who was sentenced in Sudan for the infringement of the Islam, was sentenced on Thursday night of a court in Khartum to 15 days and then sentence.
The British was accused of having six-year-old school students to give a teddy-bearer the name of Mahomet, although any presentation of the Islamic prophets is understood.
She would have won it to be extracted.
On Sunday, the 54-year-old primary student, who was at the High School of Khartum, was accused of the Islamic Criminal Law of the Arab Republic, was the parent of students of the Southern Cultural Ministry.
In fact, this matter takes its start in September when the teachers request their six-year-old students to ask for a name for the classiteddy.
The children have eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reported Leader Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class agrees, select 20 of 23 children Mohammed as the most favorite names.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophets, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bird up and the signature My name is Mohammed .
The beer himself did not have a shield with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the presentation of the Islamic prophets will be viewed as a condemnation of the Islamic.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well, and she had never had done anything to draw close to her religious faith, I regret that she had requested the children to vote for a name, his view is just about an innocent error.
A view that shares the numerous teachers of teachers who are very attentioned to their students and as a person who never speaks in the class about religion.
Remember that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common name given in England, for which 14 different writings exist in England.
This most often chosen name of Muslim families applies to the prophets (this is often given to the first born of a family).
But how did the rules apply to the use of this pre-name?
For example, can you give him a game?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
Wednesday, the last negotiations meeting in Vienna had no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the lack
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo have finished a sixth and last discussion meeting in Baden, Austria, without having to be able to overcome their conflicts on the future status of the separatistic province.
It is unfortunately that the parties could not agree on the status, explained the European Commissary Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With the emphasis on the fact that peace in the region had been on the game, the American opponent Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina requested to follow their commitments towards peacekeeping, and also to continue the discussions on the end of the negotiations.
There will be no violence in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and said that there are clear challenges.
End of the communications on 10 December
The Communicators of the Troika, which join the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be meeting last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province of Albanian speaking could be clearer when Ishinger, Wilsner and the Russian Commissary Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko reaching their report to the UN Security Council until 10 December.
The bathing discussions, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiation meeting since the Troika last August of the UNO had received the task to a new communication.
Americans and Europeans shall notify that their communication mandate will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the authorisation of the independence of Kosovo to the Security Council, are beyond the negotiations on this end date.
Russia was and continued to speak with a negotiated solution, a unique solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A single declaration of independence?
After eight years under UNO’s management, the Western countries shall hold the EU's independence under supervision for the only solution with future.
Pristina is willing to announce this one if the Security Council should not decide on its favor.
Belgrade consists of more autonomy
Unfortunately, there was no agreement, and the President of the autonomy authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, was known in the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar Rebellion and future Prime Minister of Province, shared their regrets.
However, he added that the proposed plan on the autonomy of a past which led to murder and deportation .
Domino Effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic was, on the other hand, the view that a compromise was always to work, and the Albanian majority warned from Kosovo before the consequences of a single declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade means that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that has still been so much caused by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, it does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Thursday, the Serbian delegation had found that each decision would be taken alone and only in the Security Council where the Russian associators had a veto law.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word.
Only one decision from the series of Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, explained the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostuni.
These negotiations have longed two years.
They must end as they have started: in the Security Council.
The journalists answered Fatmir Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status and added that each single declaration of independence of the Albanian population will be delayed in vote with the Western countries.
Bush discovers an agreement between Israel and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was assembled on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a common statement.
He further explained that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had joined themselves immediately to start negotiations to find a final rule of the 60 years of old conflict between their two peoples.
In the two men, Bush promised that he will do everything to help them to conclude a peace contract before the end of 2008.
The Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must set up its colonization work, explained Bush, remembering their commitments towards the peace plan that this 2003 had agreed.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian validity are aimed at a peace agreement on the last end of Abbas to clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues .
This designation includes the three major problems to turn into the conflicts between Israelites and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestinian, the status of Jerusalem and the slope of Arab refugees, which have been disappeared in the course of the conflict of 1948 from their homes today in Israel.
After the American President Abbas accepted the word and found that the future negotiations will be conducted comprehensively and greenly and provide a rule for all points, including Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
As Olmert accepted the word to him, he obliged to carry out the future weapons negotiations directly and without interruption and to try to be completed before the end of 2008.
Bush has established the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two States, a Palestinian and a Israeli who exists next to the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia opened that Bush received an insurance in this sense of Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has leaded one of all Arab countries to the way offering peace to Israel, in exchange of the displacement of all Arab regions that were placed during the war of 1967, including Ostjerusalems.
Annapolis represents a different way in the history of the Middle East, especially because it is cut into the roots of the conflict and its central faces, means the Saudi Arab prince in his interview with the urgency of Arab language financed by Saudi money.
The police are not responsible for the complainant.

Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would also exclude any serious errors.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the findings that are necessary for further investigations, and in which you need to be careful.
Libring has taken a look at these little moments short after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct look at the scenes.
Soon we're with my cousin, the hospital sisters in the hospital, out of trying to get them back, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a totally disrupted police, who went down.

Not yet is planned more than a third of pregnancy
This calculation takes into account the unwanted weaknesses (24%), as well as the bad planned or unprevisible grain.
Even today, 40 years after accepting the Newest Section, which allowed the receipt prevention in France, one of the three pregnancy (36%) is not planned, as a study of the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Inded) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted weaknesses (24%), as well as the bad planned or unprevisible grain.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of receipt prevention such as pills or spirals are still a 5-6% deficiency rate.
According to the Institute, which determines that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years that use the pills has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of receiving prevention has yet been a better control of fruitability.
In any case, eight of ten guests were carefully planned today.
In one of five pairs even calculate exactly on the month, and, if possible, the yeartime in which it seems to be the most convenient to get a child.
Spectacular repair at the room station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and its cameras from the International Space Station (ISS) have been used for more than seven hours in the world in order to perform the spectacular reparatory of a defective solar colletctor that is uncomfortable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A decrease due to his duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed that he has been organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to perform the repair have achieved a number of recursements.
The problem was held at midnight when the astronauts had downloaded the Harmony module from the space-free Discovery, a large part of the cylinderförmide, which must immediately take the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This Module is a type of landscape bridges for the Module Labore.
But you have to be able to get it with electricity.
The second task of the disposal, therefore, was to implement a 17.5 tonnes of serious module for the production of electricity through solar collectors that were already on the ISS to put it into its final position.
After it was slaughtered, the use of the restructuring of the suncollectors of the module with a spanшир of 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors that let themselves fall like a acordeone was damaged by a cut cable on a length of approximately one meter.
The restructuring was stopped to prevent the collector no longer.
The astronauts, which originally abandoned the space discovery and then another suncollector whose rotation system was missing, should have been obliged to reparse the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected at the end of the 30 meters long controlled arms of the room, which was taken at the station, to run the repair.
He is one of the best spacewalkers of the NASA.
Great, resistable, very sent, he has a goodly developed super body and long arm.
The 46-year-old physician has therefore been selected to operate the lost sun collectioner.
After he had precisely observed the damage, he crossed the faulted cable and confirmed a kind of shoes on the damaged place.
He was supported by a second spacewalker, who remained near the slope, and, inside, by the other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, commanders of the placement.
The tool that he used to create a mini-hockey board, developed with isolator, to create a few hundred flights to prevent an electric shock, had thought and baptized the astronauts on the board of the station.
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited, until the collector was completely defeated before he declined his tools and returned to the station.
Last afternoon the astronautes had a half day dispatch before today seven astronauts returned to the rooms of Discovery to predict the return to the earth to the midnight.
The title EADS sanctioned at the Börse
After announcing the aircraft and defence group that it must be spent between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros in order to affect the residues of the A400M, the EADS Action presents a significant decrease in the Paris Burse.
EADS is currently losing 4% to 21,96 euros at the Paris Burse.
The group was forced to revise its business prognosis for 2007 again to refer to the residues caused by the only slowly advanced development of the engine of the A400M, which delay the flight of the flight.
The costs announced in October to compare the delay in the delivery of their military transportation flights are between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, which was more than a billion for airbus, announced the mother centers of the European manufacturer EADS.
Based on these costs, EADS will be able to announce new operational objectives (EBIT) for 2007, without further details.
The group also argued that the evaluation of the new costs corresponds to the six-month decline.
Remember that EADS' business service has been decreased from 86% in 2006, as a result of the delay of another programme, the costs associated with the very large refrigerator A380.
Originally, the group had prepared a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The selection of the Status Quo
On Sunday, it will not be reassured when the urnes are urned: the Russian mass will decide for President Putins party, the Russian United Nations.
After a very shocked election campaign, she confirms its efforts for stability, even by authority.
Three days before the Parliament's election, the Russian President Wladimir Putin offers a message to the electors whose content will be secreted on the public senders.
He does this in his property as a special candidate of the Russian United Nations, the Pro-Kreml Party, for which it announces an overwhelming victory.
Last night the President has not seen anything when he accepted the foreign messagers, and he was satisfied to deliver a new point of attack against the Western forces who are accused of the infringement - his favorite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and we hope honest elections, extremely aware and open, without fraud, he added.
From the view of the opposition, they've been declined.
You're planning an election campaign by pressing.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that it would never have given such smiling choices, never even in the time of Eltsin.
On the last weekend, the demonstrations were sentenced to be sentenced for an unlawful demonstrations, Garry Kasparovder for an unlawful demonstration for five days, according to his lawyer.
The Russians have saved the identity of the Homo Soviet
Once this Parliament's choice without enthusiasm, two continuing questions have been addressed:
Who will take Putin's follow-up as President?
Last night, the office has announced the date of the first election of the presidency election, on 2 March 2008, and the applicants have been known until 23 December.
Since he selected 2000 and was re-selected in 2004, the Wladimir Putin cannot occur for a third mandate.
And now there is no follower.
What role will Putin play in March?
Prime Minister?
Is the President of the Parliament and the Alliance of the Russian Party, the Government and the President?
Whatever it will be, the parliamentary or the presidency chose, which will triumphate the previous power.
It's tradition.
The Russians have saved the identity of the Homo Soviet Homo, they are not the Lord of their squecksal, which means the sociolog Lev Goudkov, Director of the Independent Centre Levada.
The historical Nikolai Kopossov from the National University of Sankt Petersburg still continues: the civil society has been developed in this country, which has been Christianized in the five centuries to Europe, only very slowly developed; the famous Community's spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
According to the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin again joined the model of a paternalistic state, which was completely accepted by the people, so much more, since no terrorism followed this new paternalism, but a certain economic well-being, Mary Lipman is the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians refused from free pieces to the personal responsibility which they have posted shortly after the crash of the UDSSR.
For what time?
These phenomena relate to all society stories, including the business world.
And the administrative site understands to maintain the status of Quo: 65 Governance (of 85 Russian Presidents) applies to the local election lists of the Russian United Nations.
The new freedoms from the West are often equal to Chaos, as in the 1990s.
The generality will benefit stability.
In this sense, Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Where to go to?

Serious Andenkins
After being treated with more than 60 years of confidence, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, who document the 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now free.
The 47 million documents of the Archive, which were undertaken at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be viewed until now, except with an humanitarian perspective, individually and namely, a question of a former sacrifice or its members.
The 11 with its administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed in May 2006 to make them available for researchers and historians.
The opening has been valid since yesterday after the ratification process.
Heicule information
The access of the historics to Bad Arolsen will be able to conduct research, especially on the deportation of prisoners, infringements of the concentration stocks and the health status of the pregnant workers , Declared Reto Meister, Chief of this Archive, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were also available to make these named documents for publicity, due to the heavy character of information.
For example, the appropriate homosexuality or the spiritual difficulty of some deportation sacrifices.
The lists of concentration stocks or detention orders issued by the Gestapo were assembled in a practical basis following the war: the civilians who were deported or the pregnant work were to find, and, where appropriate, to give them a evidence of their arrest to evacuate their way to their punishment.
Still today, editing more than 300 personal requests in Bad Arolsen.
However, a part of the scientific community only shows limited interest in access to bad arolsen.
Neither should be expected in these documents, Mr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the research centre for the anti-semitism of the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to achieve a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, the mutual trade between India and Europe is already reached by the 60 billion euros in the year.
The EU is the most important trade partner in India and is 18% of its external trade.
The European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, acknowledged that the European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's Foreign Ministers had recently given the European Commission Green light to open negotiations in order to sign the Free Trade Agreement (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-South Asian Nations (Asia), which has already reached the mutual trade between India and Europe in the year.
The EU is the first trade partner in India and is 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the European Commission's numbers, India is only the nine trade partner of the EU.
A free trade package will lead to the two economic spaces, and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the most frequently exported products of India. The European Commissioner continued to declare that the Asian and European Ginees have not been covered annually with the value of 47 billion euros and services in value of 10 billion euros, this week, Danielle Smadja, President of the European Commission in New Delhi, and regret that the mutual trade has not yet been equipped with its potential.

The Bank of England takes note of the threat and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about the re-establishment of the credit conditions, and announced a offer of ten billion pounds with a base rate of 5,75% for five weeks, a offer with an inadequate duration period.
In order to defeat the fears that the financial market will be particularly hard in the end of the year, and to give the banks a greater consciousness of how they should organize their liability positions in this time, the Bank has intended to provide a significant part of their spatial installations during the maintenance phase which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, in a communication.
The bank further states that, on 6 December, 10 billion funds (14 billion euros) will be circulated in this way, as a basis tax rate and only 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE brings its liquidity into an open market operation for five weeks.
This happens normally for one week.
In its communication, the EEA adds that it is willing to take further measures to obtain the different interest rates of the interregional expenditure rates by day to day.
The different interest rate from day to day was at midnight at 5,829%.
The three-month scene has been detained at 6,6%, something higher since September 18.
Since the financial crisis in the sums of the Bank of England have been linked to criminal costs that the banks had stopped to take them into account since the beginning of the sums of the sums of the Bank of England.
According to certain costs, strengthened by the development of the fund currency in contrast to the euro, there are many suggestions to sign the sums that the European Central Bank has been launched, to benefit from the interest rates and to safeer discretion.
UMP and NC are deemed to review the proposals of the PS to purchase power
On Thursday, the UMP and New Zealand groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist legislation on purchasing power, which is equal to a rejection of the text.
The text contained in a socialist Niish (session on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping) was about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS at midnight, and the majority of 50% of which was to be employed, to restore the TIP, to a transport check or to limit the middays.
After the UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was resolved after the main debate, which was cut by a partially heavy word change between majority and opposition, a few hours prior to the television amount of Nicolas Sarkozy on the purchase power.
The Chairman of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will propose the totality of its proposals as an amendment to the draft legislation for the correction of the financing, which was reviewed by the Assistant week.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous views regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the Promotor/Produce the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is a honor for our company to work together with a person who, not less than the example of the current festival movement in America, shared Charlie Jones from C3 on billboard.com.
C3 celebrates the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer target for camping holidays.
The festival is probably located on a 500-acre large private color from Philadelphia about 40 minutes away from August 8.-10.
The Chief of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most famous festivals of the world.
1989 he took the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which locks around 80,000 people annually.
Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival in 1999, and then, 2006, the Festival Republic created the Festival Latitude Festival in Henham Park.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been owner of its property to care for the production of licensing concepts and organizational tasks of Glastonbury Festival, which can take up to 177.500 people.
Charlie Jones from C3 describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been in there, says that his company and Melvin Benn's company are parallel to work together to offer a festival event in the European style.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and co-operated with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations from the city and the Commission was motivated and encouraging to this project.
Unfortunately, we remained at police debates regarding the current management, and Charlie Jones continues.
"Thankly, we could discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare a great festival on a extraordinary place that will finally benefit from the population."
C3 Presents returned to life at Grand Park Chicago in 2005, after 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of Festival.
The two events can be achieved by $9,8 million and $11,8 million in brutal tax rates in 2007.
These two festivals are located in urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, instead of what is most important on the urban green surfaces," says Charlie Jones.
"This is how to switch these two concepts together in order to simultaneously allocate the impression of a rural festival to the European and urbanally in the American way."
Vienna is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Community of Vienna, including the Citizensman, takes the end of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The last caller refuses to give the conditions of the agreement, but he confirms "as they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to celebrate a festival that hopely will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the acquiring capacity of the Festival is very large, in about 80,000 people at Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vienna will offer shock rock, but music will be very divers, in hope to lock all kinds of observers," says Charlie Jones.
His partner from C3, who has received the Top Independent Promoter price of the last Bollett Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is on the terminal.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no lower than the terminal.
These checks are among the delegated tasks.
A political "heikles Mandat", because the Governor of California, Arnold Black Zeager, is in charge of "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate the Gouverneur?
"You must be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are good, she'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who are holding for the best", he says.
The run on the festivals.
However, for Denis Turcotte, it is now the priority of the Kino's main priority.
The jagd after the Oscars started.
On all festivals at the west coast, even though Sundance, from Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, is going to present the movies from Quebec, to evaluate them and to ensure that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful idea on the 30. Mill Valley Film Festival for a few weeks.
It will be presented on the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil are on the place in Santa Monica and is presented on the 30th Star Denver Film Festival in November.
This month also presented four long and four short films on the American Film Institute.
Does the Börse be a final year-really? Unity with experts because of the US hypotheke crisis
With nearly five weeks to the year end at the Börse, investors have already been shocked with regard to the next end year-Rally.
However, experts cannot create safe prognoses in this regard.
Banif believes that it is statistically considered that the month in December at the Burse normally is with a positive market development.
However, it is not a reason for a short-term prognosis, only on the basis of statistics, but not to determine the current market events, especially when seriously engaged.
Although other experts do not have such a strong rate increase in the last few weeks of the year, they noted that the burden currency is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market shareholders. These investments are mainly affected by the lack of safe share funds in pension funds, which are strongly affected by the estimated trend of values.
As a result, these experts are considering that the Börse is a higher-separated rate of market changes, especially because we are not able to evaluate the levels of the possible decline of the US note bank's interest rate, a insecurity which is insecurity, especially on the increased rail prices and the risk of increased inflation rates.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the Sellings Division at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is an entitled time to proclame an advanced market Rally.
The chances are not very good, safeguards the experts.
The Spanish share index Ibex has already lost a value of 4 % since its maximum brand on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative view.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at intermoney, Ibex 35 could conclude with nearly 16.000 points the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional, each year for this time.
However, the expert has found that this year could develop something different, especially because of the second week of December, and then directly after the bridge on the day of the Constitution, the end-year-Rally event.
The analyst believes that price changes would not affect market trends.
According to the evaluation of Federico Olucha, analysis at the Bank Investis, the current market assessments are at a nearly technical level, which could lead to a decrease of the index values which decreased the consequences of the US hypothetic market crisis.
The analyst believes that this is positive.
The analysts are agreed in the selection of the values that the Ibex should take to new maximums.
Solana of Intermoney claims that this year the great values are on the line.
The expert would contain the two large banks and some real estate companies, since the electricity sector will be more cost-time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha assured the bank Inversis that the entities will be associated with the bank and industry sector.
If the Rally is actually fitted, the real estate companies will benefit from its own.
In the last few months, the ACS is on the reception course and we hope that other real estate companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, take the same way, so the experts.
With regard to the increased consumption during Christmas, the market event is determined during the last half of the periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive overall results, even though they are only in low numbers of Spanish markets.
Five times in seven years
In the past seven years, the December was only in two cases.
At the end of 2003, the technological plate led the bars from their crisis and launched at the same time the real end-years until the last year.
This year, in which Ibex was 35 to 28.17 percent points, the December increased to 6.68%.
Whether 2008 the fifth year won will be followed (the Ibex grows from January to 8,36%) and can also present an end-year-old period.
Popular will open its 200 credit institutions from Monday to Friday 12 hours on day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of his branches.
In the most economic regions of Spain, the total of 200 of them have been set up.
For the institute operating under the Markenname Popular Max, these delays means a large milk stone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutes, since the Popular is the first banking group, it is the slogan to extend the opening times of its filial on Wednesday to 20.30 p.m. and to take place at the afternoon from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The BBVA banking group, which has also repeatedly read the extension of its opening periods in the delays, has not yet considered a definitive conclusion.
The current negotiations of the bank with the employees seem to have an agreement with 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturday and opened for a week afternoon, even if not for the customer.
Whether further banks of the new initiative, which are adapted to the opening periods, are depending on the experience values of the public bank.
And just this is the hope that the people follow with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening times of those branches, which can also be accompanied by the purchasing customers as a result of their situation as well as by smaller and medium-sized enterprises.
The bank wants to open the new 200 supplies during the next 18 months, as it is not new, but changed opening times.
For this purpose, the bank will convert the localities of those delays that are already in business zones and compare the individual customer profile of the various zones.
Thus the expansion of the opening times will be connected to a new space of the branches, which is expressed by a modern, frozen design.
The competent bank representative Angel Rivera ensures that restructuring does not require greater investment but agreed with an increased staff institution, since a filial was now not six, but eight or nine assignments needed.
The disbursements that are even equipped with additional areas for SMEs will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
People have already tried his concept of nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience values were positive, so Angel Rivero.
The delays of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Dunell and the Gran Vía are chosen for what seems to have been a quiet solution.
Popular drives about 2500 dischargements at the moment.
And more than 60 operating under the name of Mundocredit. They are specialized on immigrants and also enlarged opening times, even on Sun and Festivals.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of the BBVA is not used, as most of them are offered a wide selection of non-financing services to sell.
We don't want to make competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
With telephoneica, they have come to the agreement to sell external bank personnel mobile phones.
The Spanish private telecinco first doubles its barsen value for the first time and then removes its rivals Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the director of Telecinco, Paul Vasile, reported his satisfaction at the end of Börsen. He had increased his value for the two times of his rival Antena 3.
But one aspect of joy was struggling: this is exactly what I was hurted; not that we have a higher growth, but that we had less losses, he realized.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they have not yet been deeply depressed.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a plus of 2,54%.
This wine is less than 15.66% of its losses this year.
The company value now reached 4.488.88 million euros, with the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento is only involved in 13%.
Rivale Antena 3 lost 1,52 percent points since January and has reported a total loss of 40.5%, so that its market value is 2.193.46 million to half.
In the case of Sogecable 3,531 million, the market value of other officially reported communication companies increases at 2.518.53 million and, in the case of Sogecable, at 1.779 million in Prisa (Organist of the Zeitung Cinco Días).
The comparison with Antena 3 may be denied by the fact that it is about two similar companies, so Vasile.
Indeed, there is still the question in which way we can actually act boursetechnologically, what price and how we can build it on customer level.
Telecinco explained his project a week ago that this year was the first televisor with more than 1,000 million brutal wins from advertising income. This safeguarded Guiseppe Tringali, the director of Telecinco and Publicspana, the public company of the group.
If the project should be implemented, the sender would increase its public events compared to 965.4 million from the previous year to 3.6%.
In the case of Antena 3, the net rate increased up to 1,6% in the first nine months (to up to 734.4 million), while net income from television business could only increase 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for the improved telecinco Börsen history see the analysts at the high Payout Ratio that could present the company up to this time: 2006, Alejandro Echevarria was a 100%-face-face-building expense.
Vasile, however, ensures that the ratio could still vary after purchasing 33% of the share of finished milk, with mediaset as mother society, even if it is too early for an official advertising.
We are able to pay at least 50% of the share, even if we have always shown more significantly.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year whose share values we could already increase by purchasing 33% of the final milk.
According to the analysts, the market is currently a number of losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its professional calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the increase in the expected growth rate, which would reduce from 10.5% to 8,4% and 2009 from 5,5% to 5,1%.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4,5% and 7,5% for 2009.
3 Options.
1.
Ibersecurities: place on its high effects-free and sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: missing Telecinco (acquire) as a result of the numerous encouragements and the prosperous market, a most advantageous position in Antena 3 (keeping).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to reverse the expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (reduced market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agrees to the Directive of the IFID, which entered into force on 1 November.
Parallel on Parliamentary preparation, which has completed its meeting today with the Congress decision in the Senate on the additional/amended proposals for the project, the Government has published the provisions laid down in the new law, with the desire to allow the entry into force of both rules to the end of the year.
The representatives of the various enterprises unilaterally congratulated the efforts of the Congress and Senate Members who had followed their negotiations and votes to establish the best possible arrangements ensuring the security of investors and regulating individual entrepreneurs' activities in order to ensure the general effective market events.
The MIFID, which reaffirms the value paper service regulation, follows further to the modernization of the financial markets a improvement of investor protection, increased control rights of the Spanish Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables both specialized companies and legal persons to provide financial consultations and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS) to consulting companies which are assembled with the installation and communication companies of value papers.
It also enhances the number of systems for the implementation of financial transactions, so that the regulated cycle markets will be added to the multilateral systems of effective business and the systems for internationalization of trade contracts which would finally be competitive with the current economic operators.
The law requires investing enterprises to report the major points of their business profile, the confrontation and the forms of transaction with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's control performance.
The Committee on Economics of the Congress has made further amendments, with the decision that the debt descriptions under the titles now need to apply to the investor as complex financial resources confirmed by the US hypothestics and banks crisis. (US hypotheks crisis)
Furthermore, the Directive was implemented in force for the legal limitation of the works of diplomated economic scientists; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation which was limited to the working areas reserved for the economic scientists.
On the other hand, the Senator pointed out new positions in the financial sector, such as the economic mediator who works on foreign accounts does not require authorisation from the CNMV and could offer its services to trade products and to customer profit in several investment enterprises simultaneously.
The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) has increased up to five decades in November and is now at 4.1%.
The Eurostat, which serves for assessing the rate of inflation within the European Union, provides the average price development in Spain in November.
His publication corresponds to the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) which aim to compare local and quality products by the notification of the data.
Prognoses for the indicator can be created prematurely by applying the same procedure as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time, different statistical modelling methods can be used to assess the information that is not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistics Camp (INE) noted that the previously identified indicator should not agree with the final result announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at relatively high levels
According to the report of the Governing Heads and Minister of Economic and Finance, Peter Solbes, the increase in the VPI in November would be a temporary development; it also ensured that the price index would continue to remain a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, soldiers noted in the halls of the Congress building that even if the present number is not good, the inflation difference in Spain was more or less than the other members of the monetary Union in the last few years.
In addition, he stated that there were less surprises in November than the last month in which the Government did not calculate such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , which was known by the Minister of Economic and Finance in terms of the present prognoses.
Virgin is calculated with Northern Rock income of more than 42 billion euros in the coming three years
The values of Northern Rock are cut over half, after the bank in the middle of September of the last year's crisis, the British Note Bank had requested an emergency credit, and only 12,000 million pounds (which corresponds to 16,800 million euros).
At this time the ownerships of the bank are $25,000 million, a sum that has been significantly cut by the loss of confidence of the customers, and also, despite the 100% guarantee of the Government that the money is safe until the crisis continues.
The company Virgin, which would continue to deliver the group under the Markenname Virgin Money, must take about a fourth of the income of the British banks that will be collected from the plants of the next three years to purchase the exactly 18 billion pounds that still need to achieve their objectives of 30 billion.
The group of the Multimillionary Richard Branson, who is known by its advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, takes into consideration 50,000 million pounds (approximately 70 million euros) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock appointed the Virgin concerts in which three other companies participated as his favorite bishops to lead it out of the insolvency.
The Chief of Totana was arrested because of a defence in the participation of urban corruption
In the morning, the Spanish police has arrested the current citizensman of the Totano (Partido Popular) locality belonging to the municipality of Murcia (Partido Popular), due to the urgent suspicion of conspiration in urban corruption found this week.
Furthermore, one of the secretariats of the Council and the Chief of the Communities Policei were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo was last May the office of Juan Morales, the current deputy of the Party Popular and at the time of the Common Council of Totana, and could be the original chairman of the Complot.
The officers do not continue to investigate the business documents of the Community and the Ministry of Cities planning and complete further arrests within the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of the principal suspect in the case of urban corruption found at the beginning of this week.
According to Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and therefore the privileged deputy Juan Morales, when leaving the residence of his mandate, he was arrested as a result of important documents to be linked to the Complete.
In addition, other sources of information from the contract payments of Morales to a gallery company that provides the conclusion of a urban construction contract where the construction of a 200 hectares has been decided.
At present, eight people are in investigation.
Bono agreed to accept the candidature of the PSOE in Toledo and, if a election seat, to accept at the Congress.
The former Defense Minister, José Bono, adopted the offer of the Government President and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and he will then take the list of the PSOE candidates to the next general elections in Toledo and, in case of a seat of socialists, the office of the President of the Congress.
So José Blanco, the PSOE organization secretariat, and Bono announced in the press conference that, today, a meeting with Zapatero was held at the headquarter of the party.
The government head believes that the offer is justified to the former Minister, since it is important in the policy to be able to count the best and Bono is among the best.
Furthermore, the politicians from Mancha would be candidated as President of the Congress for the Party in the case of a victory for socialists in the future elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Presidents of the Congress, who had announced the last 15 November that the next general election was not to end his career in the public policy and, instead, to set up in the university area for climate protection.
The former Minister had to realize that the President of the Government had continued to return to political events since his return two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that the party, as the name of the Vice-President for Economics, did not want the citizens to take up the posts of the Chairman of the Conference and called it as an act of transparency .
If he really should take the office, he hopes to turn the room into a house of respect and not to be angry or grief, so to allow the citizens to seem more similar.
Unfortunately, from time to time the impression of whether the only place where you can't speak in Madrid is quiet and left is the Congress; so the President of the Government has been interrupted up to 26 times in Senate.
At the same time, he glorified the current President Manuel Martin and his good work and said that he would not want to be able to have the office anymore, as otherwise his political opposers would be arroganzed.
Climate Proposals
Since climate debates regarding the skeptics of climate change, as well as those subject to a social and political debate on this subject, the movement must be a very strong cohesion of the day.
In particular, if it is a leader of the movement, which, as in the case of President Zapatero, the fight against climate change is more important than the fighting of Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, provides it in a statement on trade, or not to its Government, which has decisively contributed to the fact that Spain within the EU is at the level of countries which have at least fulfilled the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Those who are responsible for the non-compliance of the requirements on which sectors this is to be put, and why his Government, who proposed the Treaty with the Planet, did not stop this development.
In addition, it is now able to present the Spanish citizens the measures he planned to combat climate change without circumstance.
What enterprises will be affected to change the behavior of citizens, what individual and collective sperm measures should be carried out, and what economic consequences they have.
Exactly said who needs to be sacrificed and will be paid for the saving of the planet.
However, it has and will not give such statements in the future.
It's because it's about the sacrifice and the payment.
Because the measures that can be implemented really against climate change are unpleasant.
They are free, unacceptable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the PSOE benzine census proposed by Zapatero was dangerous, so that he saw responsibilities to return the proposal.
In this way, it is now important to save the planets with nothing, so with pure propaganda and empty speech without any real consequences.
With impressionable comments, Commissions, committees, protocols and new employees.
With its contracts with the planet, the other political politicians should not speak, nor approximate, nor demand, nor demand, but take the appropriate expenditure of meetings, struggle meetings, and advise others with his sweet mourth and goods.
However, this can only happen if the treaty does not disappear from its pure virtual nature and then does not require that the driving route will be the only continued vehicle or we can only feed with a case.
The Chief of Citizens and the Police Chief of Totana are due to a degree of urban corruption.
The Civil Guardia has arrested the Citizensman of Totana, the popular politician José Martinez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretariat of the Citizenship and a hotel employee because of the murmuring suspicion of urban infringements, he said today, from investigation crystals.

My home doctor gives me one of his long, rare research articles with the title: money leads to active certain brain areas, especially if others get more.
Thus, the feelings resulting from the content of colleagues are depending on the content of the monthly payment.
The study was produced through a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last version of the Scientific Journal of Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn Survey Center Life & Brain, the activement was the most intensive when the participants gave the correct answers and reclaimed his player.
The researchers could realize that the brain invasion is always very moderate when both participants were right with their response and then see the same content; but if one of them received the double, it was also a greater cerebral activity.
I am not very sure if there are so many scientific approaches to achieve such results.
The Ombudsman of the Balkan
Carla del Ponte has been unfortunately slaughtered for eight years after the offenders of the Balkan wars. Your office is located in the State Court of Criminal Court of Ancient Yugoslavia, in La Haya.
Your mandate will go to the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a smiling and laugh eye, as the chief responsibilities of the massaker of Srebrenica - at the eighth thousand bosnic muslims - the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bossian director Radovan Karadzic remained free.
Their name is listed by the ruler of Switzerland, Marcel Schüpbach, as a presentation for the title of his documentary film La List de Carla (2006, in Spain); a film that follows the Swiss State advisor from Belgrade to New York in their projects, and puts out the deceived crimes and presss any governments in order to swallow their networks.
What insurance is best for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high expenditure, which is reversely depending on the height of different factors, e.g. by age, sex, time of production of the driver, family status, type of the safe cars and its use, etc.
Having a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the correct vehicle model.
First of all, we must be a clear one that we have to do here.
An insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance company.
This agreement shall be established in writing by a insurance contract which determines that the company receives the insurance premium and is obliged to present the corresponding amounts of insurance in a case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance composed by several factors, e.g. age, sex, time of the construction of the leadership, family status, type of the vehicle to ensure or its use.
Insurance companies shall establish their prices in accordance with the statistics, so that higher contributions are also available in a higher accident survey.
For this reason, both over 25-year-old and women must have less contribution payments, as statistics indicate that these groups are a lower accident rate thanks to their expectation.
The same applies to married persons, as they are, according to the statistical values and then, according to the conviction of enterprises, to less accidents than only.
The use of the vehicle affects the frequency of the driving and thus the probability of a accident.
More frequently, the use of the damage is more likely than the damage.
In order to establish the premises, the insurance must take into account a number of points.
This is why the driver also needs to study the situation in order to choose the auto-assurance that is mostly equipped with its personal needs.
We are now listening to the most important points that should take into consideration in the selection of insurance to take place not only for a performance, but also for a prestigious choice.
The under-25-year-olds will take place in the choice of a price-favorable insurance at numerous obstacles, such as the low-driving practice and the young driver's appearance.
Even if it would be the best for ideal insurance protection to complete a full-case co-assurance, there are more precious alternatives.
The careful drivers can choose a full box with self-participation, so that the performance of a full-case assurance is covered, but they are offered to a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay a part of the amount incurred by the damage.
The amount is set before the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher than the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, the main President of Spain in First Europe, a share company for online insurances.
Another option is the extensive insurance that assurances the customers against external accidents, however not against the damage caused by the car.
Furthermore, this type of insurance would cover the steel, burning and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce the insurance costs; so your deposit will increase by trying to run carefully and avoid accidents.
A deposit is a decrease of the baseline to the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a punishment includes an increase.
The amount of reimbursements and penalties depends on the company and their revenue.
If the company has a huge year after himself, it may be allowed to increase the bonus orders, explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year market exceeds, it is simpler to conclude a contract for the driver. This is why it is the fact that the accident rate is raised with increased bicycle practice.
Therefore, it is the most sensitive to decide on an fully-case insurance insurance with self-employment.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident or at the time of the driving, explains the Spanish chief of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents are in the second practice year following the fear of the applicant.
However, it is only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
On the page of the insurers, marriages with children as customers with the lower accident rates, and indeed, their contributions are also low.
In this case, a full-case insurance would be the best option for self-employment (with a amount of EUR 300). In the case of a high deposit, an enlarged insurance is recommended to be used for the first third vehicle year.
They are totally disappointed and have a larger purchase power that allows them to make a higher contribution, Luis Noguera determines.
It is intended to conclude an fully-case insurance with self-employment (in an amount to 150 euros) or to be extended insurance, which is only in place for a sufficient higher deposit.
Finally, it must be observed that auto-assurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accidents, but also because it applies high costs that it requires to be taken to a natural selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow in Mayland is on the point for the acetelfinal
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will be fighting on the point in San Siro, which is lacking them to reach their objectives even before the end of the Champions League front. Italians need to reach the point at the point of their group, while they decided on their participation in the shoes.
The Italian manage has already five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with an indecision in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow still needs a further need for nine points to make sure that the FC Shakhtar does not receive the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of the D group will be held a week before the end of the sixth game round, since the FC Mayland has to be held at the FIFA World Club Meeting in Japan, where he will be struggling in the 13th half-final for the first time to enter into the end of the 16th.
So this group will be closed before all others and the unresolved results in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadion on the other hand, even if both teams are trying to win. The Italians will not be shown at home the Keltic Glasgow, which would be known in the case of a victory grouper and thus have a better starting position in the axlefinal.
The mansion of Gordon Strachan could even be able to qualify himself at a bed of the Shakhtar FC. However, he should not be very trusted in such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are in a balance; they lost almost the last week in Glasgow (2-1), but they could win (2-0) at the second game.
Thus, the mail countries will try to shoot the night. The again hope to reach the shooting final of the converted champion league after they were shocked in the pre-screen game season in exactly the same round by a gate of caka in the after-time (1-0) and by a null-null-resolution on the game.
While the FC Shakhtar waits on the victory of the Rossoneri, the manity must concentrate on the own game, as both the achievement of the axlefinal and its membership in the EUFA from its victory and a Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon could, despite its lower table position, continue to participate in the largest European mastership, reduce the third place and therefore condemn the EUFA.
20,000 visits in Vancouver the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour.
The Spice Girls gave the first tour in the Canadian Vancouver in front of 20,000 viewers of the starting committee for their first tour after resolving the band in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the beginning of their concerts in the GM Place de Vancouver Stadium, that the stimming in the reconnected band was excellent.
To survive the 200,000 people in the sales stadium, a video to the history of the band was shown the end of the ninety-years for Furore.
The reconnection and the world tours are over with the publication of a new album, which contains their largest hits and two new songs, headlines and Voodoo, and that appears under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls were on the bridges of golden armbands who had given them the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The sportr was among the fanmas in the public who brought the GM Palace to frozen, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden it in the past days.
During the preparations for the Schow, Victoria Beckham was able to believe that the British Star has not been the only time to face our garden, and so I'm already shocking what he's going to do.
Sporty Spice, whose exhibition from the group in 1998 resulted in internal opinions two years later the resolution of the group, expressed her nervousity two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw the situation of publicity changed that the feelings changed to the Spice Girls.
And so I thought why not, so I am glad to have taken this decision, Chisholm expressed himself on the separation of the band which she had left for nine years ago.
The songman also believed that the strictnesses were removed and that, however, everyone was very pleased again.
However, many things have changed since the last common event of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First, the group, according to the TV CTV report, came into a special machine of the Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
When she arrived at the airport, the band of a soldier was received from children's girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will be held next in California, San José, on 4 December, and in Los Angeles (5th and 7th December).
In Madrid on 23 December, they will be joining the shoes.
New fears about the earthquake between Russia and Ukraine
A new price stretch between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports from fuel to Western Europe are affected.
The largest part of Russian landgase exports into the European Union (EU) is conducted by Ukraine and every conflict between the two nations is very accurately observed.
Kiew warned that if Moscow increases the price that it must pay for the earth gas, it will take into account higher transit costs from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two States has reduced delivery in the EU countries last year.
The recent conflict between Kiew and Moscow happens at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state Gazprom Gazprom tries to reach an agreement on how much the Ukraine must pay for Russian soil in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine must be calculated more, since the concert has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for the earthquake gas from the nearby Turkmenistans.
Analysts say that this might mean that Ukraine should pay 40% more for the imports of gasprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit States in conversation," said the Ukrainian Economic Minister of Anatoli Kinakh of the News Agency Reuters.
"The changed earth gas prices should, unfortunately, be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit expenditure [in Western Europe]."
In the last large gas stretch between Moscow and Kiew, in January 2006, Gazprom delivery in Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which drasticly led the prices to the height.
Russian gas is a fourth of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has developed the world's largest gas preventions, but many of it remains subdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom adds its own equipment with gas from Turkey and other central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS controlling foreign workers.
The Scotiate State Health Service must improve the control of the criminal registers for employees outside Europe, said a member of the Control Organization.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black, after a foreign doctor in Scotland, was taken together with the attack on Glasgow's airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scotia State Health Service has no specific opinions on the number of its foreign workers.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were correctly carried out in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial supervisor investigated the staff restructured outside the European Economic Area outside, resulting from the attack on Glasgow's airport.
Bilal Abdullah, a 28th Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Pasley, was arrested at the airport after a passenger was passed through the doors of the main flight terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared in the Old Bailey in a video transmission in October, and was shocked in connection with the smooth autobom bombardment in Britain.
It is expected that the public health services are carried out in the front of the establishment of foreign workers control to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experiences and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Scotland to review prejudiciary registers, the Agency does not have the authority to obtain these information outside the UK.
In addition to other recommendations, the report of the main investigator is now referring to the board of guidelines of criminal registering, which helps workers in control in different countries.
"By though we have found evidence on these controls in certain personal documents, these were not routinely implemented."
Black said the Scotia health authorities would follow their research guidelines before the establishment, but adds: "The report shows areas in which the system can be improved in order to ensure that precise information on the number of foreign health workers are available".
BMA Skotland President Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely uncertain," that investigations would be identified by potential NHS employees who could act in future terrorist action.
"The report states that the current pre-design tests of the NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear to which more value the recommendations will be provided", he said.
The Scotia health authorities say they are currently foreign workers who have overwhelming majority of the doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number would probably be higher, so that the situations had problems to identify those employees who were uncertainly reserved at a time.
The survey continued to observe that the therapeutic control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampin, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were maintained overall.
These include passing, work permits, and qualification controls.
the Swedish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for controlling the starts of establishment for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretariat for Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I was a concern to carry out this job in view of the terrorism attack on the airport Glasgow."
It added that, in connection with the health authorities, the Scotia government would take into account and ensure that the best practices in the updated guidelines on control in the event of the establishment of all employees, including those from the Foreign, are planned for the next month.

208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist attack
Last night Saudi Arabians found that it was 208 billion because of their membership in cells that had planned a premature attack on a oil plant, as well as spiritual and security forces.
The public television of the world's largest terrestrian exporters said that one of the cells had planned to smoke rats.
Sympathists of Al-Qaida have initiated a campaign against the monarchies since 2003, as a result of the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight military military, identified by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on a oil plant in the province of Eastern, after the television report.
Saudi Arabia has established a 3,50,000 strong inclusion troop to protect a misunderstanding Al Quaida attack on the world's largest terrestrial processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, with reference to an internal ministerial statement, states that 18 of the prisoners belonged to a cell leading to a "roket experts" which was illegally immigred into the country.
He reported that the military plans were to smoke eight projects in the Kingdom.
More than 22 prisoners were expected to carry out the report of the clergy and security forces.
The government has warned the clergy to stop Saudis, trying to join Al Qaida Military, who wants to fight the allied forces and the US supported shytic Muslim government, which are considered as ketzerical by the Hardliners under the Sunnitic Saudi.
Al Qaida Millizen considers many clergy in Saudi Arabia as in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policy of the Kingdom family dominating the government.
The Military, joined by Osama bin Laden, who was born in Saudi Arab Al Qaida leaders to go to the Prostate Saudi Government, has regarded foreign residences, government buildings and energy plants.
"This was a great effort to the security forces over the last five months," a speaker of the Ministry of Internal Affairs informed the public television.
The arrests were also a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which was intended to purchase "Takfiri thoughts" - the ideology of the radiocal Sunnitic Muslims, which supports violence against muslims, which will be burned as unbelieving and abstinent markets.
There were also 32 persons who were accused of providing financial support to the Military.
The climate on Venus could have a view to the future of the earth.
The Venus may have been a place for life, said scientists yesterday.
The data of a European space ship that is on a round trail shows that the planet is even more than it was known.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have almost the same size and have similar planet trains, but the Venus of the sun is something closer.
Thousands of years ago, they had ruled on the Venus conditions that were very similar to those on earth and could even be habitable, believe scientists today.
But because of the most unexpected carbon dioxide efficiency, the erosion of the atmosphere through suncutting and a slower rotation time, the Venus made an entire development course.
Today the planet of water is surrounded and has a surface temperature that is sufficiently hot to smell swim and is defeated by hurrican-star winds and swimming walls.
The knowledge of the European Railway Aviation Agency of Venus Express, which has studied the plants for a year, provides an extraordinary view of how the earth can develop in view of the catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Physics Division at the Oxford University, one of the leaders of Venus Express Mission, said, "It will be clear why the climate on Venus is so different to the earth while the planets are very similar. "
"Our new data allows it to build a scenario in which the Venus has started for billions of years as the earth has started, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Ambigued Uran" by the police
A kilo-active radioactive material, reported Uran, was invited yesterday by the Slovakian and Hungary police.
A police speaker said that three persons were arrested and that the material was tested.
He did not confirm whether it was a rich uranium, but said that it could be sold for $1 million (480,000) for a million.
Everything still open
Among Romey said he didn't think it was a presidency candidate to be asked by a sneeman.
However, the Republican candidate finally declared for the presidency that a debate on YouTube was taken in the normal election questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on midday 28 November were so sweet as the Sneemann, the Democratics on the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time precisely the state of the Republican Party, which involves elections in the next year.
It is not known as CNN producers who supported the debates that selected YouTube Clips that showed the starting candidates.
However, in the first half hours of the debate, which was the most long-term topic, the immigration was in the middle of the debate.
The theme is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of unresolved elections to serve a wheel when they heard things that were pleasing to them: the television statue observed the spectrums of the approval as the candidates strictly speaked over the borders.
The most intense and longest exchange of the night was between Rudy Giuliani, the National President, and Romney, who moved forward in the decisive investigations in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to defend the appeal that he had been indeed in respect of illegal immigration when he was New York's Chief.
He attacked Romany in which he accused the former Governor of Massachusetts to have established illegal immigrants in his house.
The two were particularly deeply asked as questionnaires whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illicits a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Unfavourable candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian Congress Chairman, and Tom Tancredo, a Congress Chairman of Colorado, began to look at this subject.
None of the two men have serious opportunities in the appointment, but both remain in the pension, perhaps because they have shocked before and worse than others to the immigration pauke.
At least in the field of immigration, the candidates share the same views: slightly borders, intolerance against illegal migrants.
This theme, together with the fears of gifting games from China or other concerns over the rest of the world, helps the Republicns to forget or minimise the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly addressed as other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported weapons restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drinks should be considered to be punished.
One questionnaire asked whether the candidates believe each word of the Bible.
This resulted in the view of Giuliani’s point of view, although the Bible was his favorite book, he may not believe in the story of Jonah and the Wal.
Another questionnaire asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now all expectations on the first place in a recent investigation in Iowa thanks to his long-existed Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful, but it was necessary.
When he was struggled about whether Jesus would for them, he was swearing about it and told him that he was intelligent to make a political office.
The rail remains extremely open.
Huckabees arrived in Iowa together with Ron Paul's recent cost results and his case tours in the midnight debate.
These two are shooted out of nothing, because the two fleets of the party have not yet been able to reach one of the most famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has joined the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victory message on the size of America and a twice to two floors of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is not clear with no one.
Stress of the Working Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another shooting, his way out of this remains the same.
For British Scandale, this is not particularly slow.
No bedrooms seem to be sold, no politicians Pariser hotel accounts are paid to be not sweet for foreign dents.
But the discovery that a rich businessman costs for the British government work party over more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has disappointed to report this, is something that would be good without the fighting Gordon Brown.
Once two months ago the President's proposal was taken to a election, the intellectuality of the United Kingdom was politically, noting that this decision had not affected, it was hoped that it would offer a robust and efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, who has expressed a growing delegation chairman of the Liberal Democrats, has developed the last feared brown of Stalin to Mr Bean.
The unexpected saving of Northern Rock, a bank, showed regulatory weaknesses and bad judgments under the decision.
Deeply discussed proposals for the amendment of fiscal laws have introduced enterprises against the government.
The tax loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unpredictable administrative furniture.
A trio of generics in peace began a stand in the Supreme House of Protest against the expenditure of military expenditure: the Minister of the Forces, so they said it was a part-time job.
There are now the various costs of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Labours (and her previous execution leader) have already come back.
Nothing means that Brown is inevitablely delaying.
However, governments can reach a point of shift after they are impossible to register it.
They don't want to be trusted by human policies, but they normally keep their skeps back when a new troop takes the office.
When it is clear that it is unforeseen that a Prime Minister improves the situation, and it is no longer necessary to be there, it will be over: the public service begins to be easier; the Ministers of Cabinet start to enjoy; the press is looking for bad news; and the government will be defensive and strict.
In one way, the position of Brown is particularly difficult because it is not able to deal with other political leaders to be a new one.
So he likes to lie Tony Blair, he was his super-leading.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax responsibilities document, for example, are involved in decisions which were the chief of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blair's misconduct - like in the long "Geld for Adelstitel" support of political party finance - the elections may seem to be that he was.
However, Brown's situation is not very bad as it looks
The errors are not horrible as the conservatives describe.
Like Mr. Bean, nobody died or was shocked.
And the opposite, painful, as it may be, is to remove what Browns naturally promised stalinistic tendencies: a reliable, solid and easier brutal government.
The new drink on political costs is a good example.
The Garboesk Abraham, who compares his costs with his common gifts, would not want to say public recognition for his will.
It may be so, but the decision was not to be taken to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributions are clear and they exist in a clear reason: publicity has a right to know who can buy access to those who register the country.
Watt, who said he had known by Abraham's agreement, but not that she is illegal, will, of course, have to ask some questions, just as John Mendlesohn, Labour's main finance operator, who was told about the extraordinary costs in October.
But until now, Brown is not involved: there is nothing that is clear that he knew from these confusions, although the majority of the payments was made after his office in June.
The Prime Minister has completed half of the work.
He quickly condemned the infringement of the laws by his party, but he resolved this decision by the grief after a known instrument, conducted a research committee on the subject - to make the measure full, by a bishop in peace and a judge.
In this case, "doctrines to lead" are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's a matter for the police.
However, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, how to find a permanent Chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in public life, which has been not implemented for six months, and to be forwarded with a long-term reform of political parties.
This would require to cooperate with the conservators by the Hardliners of the Labour and, if possible, to give the special financial relations with the workshops - to worse pills for a party as Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The conservators now have a clear leadership in the opinions; he has two years to get back to elections; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through unfair justice and solid competence.
Kartenhaie
Does the US credit credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it is just obviously that backflows are shocking.
Now where the American real estate market is equipped, the routines have the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts recall that credit card losses could be reached by 99 billion dollars if the income of underfinanciated credits is extended to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of the approach are clearly visible.
There are assessments for the reserves as well as for the sample rates measured by the share of the credits, which are not covered or exceeding 30 days.
In the last month, the HSBC announced that it had taken $1,4 billion income from its American consumer financing, partially because of the deficiency of credit cards.
But it's too early to fall in panic.
Losses and dreams are still low.
According to the Rating Agent Moody, the thirdquarter level of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point under the historical average.
Deterioration in the rates may, partly, be declared by technical factors.
An amendment in the American Privacy Insolvency Acts in 2005 resulted in a ruptured case of competitive notifications which reverse a large part of the card losses; the number of registrations (and so summary costs) would increase whether the general conditions for creditors are decreased or not.
The industry also reports about solid payment rates that shows how much of its debts are paying consumers each month
and confidence in credit card-based value papers is very strong, despite the standing stand in other parts of the structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research company, calculates that the expenditure amounts for 2007 will last 25% be higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market are certainly: it is probably more likely that consumers take credit card debts, now extract their own credit.
However, card exhibitors are looking at the money flow instead of capital values, so the household prices falling from the creditability of the creditor will not necessarily be changing.
You may even be advantageous for the card exhibitors.
Consumers’ encouragement to continue paying hypotheken rates is increased if the realities are less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts will be more important under the repayment priorities.
Card exhibitors can also react more faster and more flexible than creditor to the more stirming conditions by changeing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid re-evaluation of the property values.
"We will not wake up a day and fully review the loans", says the principal reporter Gary Perlin, Capital Ones.
Even if a slow-detection crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable discharge are significantly more real.
If the lower household prices and a decrease in the recession of America, the industry will certainly be before a blueer future.
Keep them look after these hair fleets.
British bankers recognize guilty in the case Enron
Three British bankers, who should be sentenced for their role in the transit system with the former head of Enron, Andrew Fastow, who had to be sentenced, changed their search at midnight.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally been used for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for the appropriate conspiration with fastow in a secret financial bed in 2000, in order to spend on costs of their employees, innocently planned.
The procedure was implemented on January.
But during a hearing before the court before the United States district Ewing Werlein Junior, each of the people in a case of fraud was accused of using telecommunications.
The three former leadership forces of Greenwich NatWest, one of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain in the course of delivery procedures that duration two years.
In the United States, it is a lost end of an investigation initiated after Enron's Summit in 2001.
The originally against them charged in 2002, Fastow noted that he was the goal of investigating the Government in relation to Enron's Decline.
The accused of the banker - called the "NatWest Drei" - they came to Houston in 2000 in order to spend a betrayful complot with fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a daughter society of Enron's partnership, controlled by Fastow, which was the architecture of numerous enron machines that had contributed to spend the company into the competition structure.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank estimated the value of its participation in the daughter society to zero, but the three British men knew that they had a significant value in reality.
An undertaking under Copper's control was granted the share of the bank to the daughter company for $1 million.
The bankers paid copper $250,000 for a participation in this company.
According to the accused, Fastow was fairly against Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares to the daughter society.
But in fact the $20 million went to the British bankers, fastows and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while fastow, copper and other $1.3 million, according to the accused.
In January 2004, Fastow acknowledged two cases of conspiration for his role in the Enrons Pleite.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow has a six-year-old prison penalty in the Federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper has a three-year punishment in a company in Texasia.
Each of the three men was on free foot on the basis of a million dollars cup, which was necessary to live in the United States in expectation of the court proceedings.
Enron, when the seventh largest company of the country, destroyed in the competition in December 2001, after years of registrative tricks, the billion debts were not more profitable or weakened.
The convergence destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
Enron-Green Kenneth Lay and the former Chairman Jeffrey Skills were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with Enron Summit.
Skilling has been sentenced for more than 24 years.
Their condemnation, fraud and other accused cases were uncomfortable after the last year he died because of heart disease.
Not all below in Moscow
The price of a flight from the Marke Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls Royce motor and enough rent to fly from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But this is a small payment for some of the rich Russians.
"They offers place for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of the Gulfstream.
"But no one asks for such many sites, because it is for a private family or a company president."
Firewall was at the Gulfstream last Friday at the Millennium Exhibition, a four-day orgic consumption to look, which was organized in a disappeared exhibition centre on the city border of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxus offers were built to interest in new money-related Russians, from Mahagoni-building Yachts to diamant-over-scale autogrips that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer took carefully a brilliant porsche on the next measurement in the view.
"This is a beautiful car, but it's small payment in comparison with us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private flights."
The Russian capital seems to be heated by a oil tree, with money as Dallas to its greenhouses.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic riches and went to Europe, where they were seen materialisticly", said Marshall Goldman, a scholar at the Davids Centre for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab transferers of the 1970s and Japanites in the 1990s, Russians are the most visible freezeers in the world.
The most exclusive Luxusmarks are looking for their part in the Golden Rush.
Anderswo in Moscow this week, a conference of the Luxus industry Donatella Verseace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, Chairman of LVMH, has taken place in Moscow to share ideas about how to sell high prices on markets like Russia.
(The Conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billion who have $282 billion in total, according to the Force list of the richest people.
Furthermore, 103.000 Russians are valued to the second class, together with $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private resources in the former Soviet Union, which has been written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russia lived under the minimum of existing.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - so we are all here", said Nicole Marais, a sale and market representative of David Morris, a London juvenile.
She had first visited the Russian handler of the Marke, the Soho Jewelry Group, the Messe.
"Women are all understood for example, and men are all valued for a possession."
While she takes a lunch in night by the halls, she calls two real estate machines, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, himself and its customers as a million.
"I shooted after the cars, and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designing that she had, as a red-teppich veteran with Joan Rivers.
The Mess seemed to go to the new ones, to make the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who were willing to visit a few hours in the stage to visit a strict shop house, which was unlikely shocked by Cadillac Escolades, tasting meat from Platin, Mövenpick Eiskre, shooted biliardistic apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddyballers.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44,57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most precious and best", said Mr. Gijrath, who is patrioticly at a measurement of the Dutch Porcellan manufacturer Royal Delft before a large imitate of a rembrandt image from handful, blue Mosaicstones.
"The Russians are more interested in climper climate."
In fact, the handlers say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old in Russian standards) have already moved from great pursuit logos to the type of nice marks with limited pieces that would not market in a trade show.
Nevertheless, thousands of people, millions, sending of millions or just tourists every day through the halls.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on Thursday last Sunday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Betten here, he had sold two $70,000 matratzensets, prepared from Seide, Cashmir and Baumwolle, with one-direct gold fabrics.
At the same time, in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a salesmanager for A1 Moto, a company provides high-end automobiles with high-end-allarm systems that his company has sold the green Chinese porche for $170,000 to a Russian million.
On Sunday, Andrei Karapedian, President of L.A. Connection, a company who adapts the luxus car to customer desire, would have sold three car rentals for a Royce Phantom, which is equal to a bonded kitchen arms, for every time $55,000.
He showed a reporter an auto-track developed for a Russian casino owner, with speeches he had overlooked with fabric Swarovski Cristals, so that it was like a roulette rade.
The costs: $22,000 for a fourth loan.
"The Russian Millennium, the Railor, or an image of the face of his wife from Cuban circumcision, will not be driving on these roots", said Mr Karapetian.
"He will save it in his 30-hour or 40-hour garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the "Russiche Millennium" phrase would now not express a lot of exclusiveness, in view of the increase in the real estate prices.
"When you have purchased a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they're probably a million, at least on the paper, if not already in bargeld," he said.
"There's more than you believe."
Those who weren't a million could do at least if they were rich at a position employed by the Alliance Continental, a Russian ownership company.
The company had set four red phone cells in British examples, which were completely taken with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said that his employees had expressed 500,000 false bank notes for the amount of millions.
Passengers agreed to discover the money purchase, mobile phone phones, while they turned back in the midst of the replacement, to let friends kiss, or simply switch a few million.
"Seen, everyone in Moscow can feel like a million", said Mr Karriev.
Prostituted operation in death in New Jersey
It was the day before the breakfast of Ronald Livingston by the large glass window of just a Little Healthier Restaurants and looked like a hospital car at the white Cape Cod two doors below the West Scott Avenue.
Shortly there was a police car.
And then there was another.
"And I saw the castle car of the medical observer," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, at midnight.
"This was the point when I knew that someone died."
The officers learned that all Mrs Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant of the Director of the National Police Department.
Now the investigators try to determine whether they died because of a procedure carried out by a non-allowed cosmetic surgery that was not identified by the police and worked in the house of the West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found what Ms Arroyos' death has caused, and hopelessly are that toxicological studies which could not be available for weeks will be helped to explain a mysterious death that has sent a tragic surprise through the headquarters of the National Police.
Mrs Arroyo has been an assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known in the Division.
"He was loyal, hard worked and hard", Mr. McCarthy said about Ms Arroyo in a telephone interview at midnight.
"He was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, an ex-natal police officer, who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11 sons, and one of the students.
Eileen Walsh, a speaker for the lawyer of the Union Council, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo was a result of an unlawful, surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities", said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's a starting investigation."
The authorities said they came to the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared in place for death.
More than one week ago, the authorities have noted a few of their investigation or the owner of the house, which is included as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs Castro was asked by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On midnight nobody opened the door to Mrs. Castros House, where a sweet rose straight is in the nice pregaren and a dalmatin behind the house.
A blue fass describes "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a replacement for Vanille in foods and parfums - sat in the parking area next to a door that led to underground.
Two mountain bikes away from Haken on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the police department of New York, Mrs Arroyo was an unprecedented value and helped him in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"He said, 'You have to hold on this or that one," he said.
"He was always here when I came here and she was always here when I went.
It was worse."
Hope that the Central Bank will decline the interests to increase the world share markets
The shares were on both sides of the Atlantic after the market hopes that the Central Bank will try to be based on the credit markets by further interest rates, by advancing comments by the Vice-President of the United States of Central Bank.
The share markets took place in London, New York and in Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the President of the Central Bank, said that the policy should react to the continuing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to relaxe a tremendous market, in view of the signs of appropriating credit expansion, Kohn said that the recent turbulences had "recently converted some of the improvements of the market functions from the late September and October".
If the increased turbulence remains, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and enterprises.
The comments were made by investors as a signal that the Central Bank has been ready to slow up and stabilize the credit conditions in the US markets and other possible interest rates.
The executions also helped to calm the Wall Street, faced with other bad news from the United States, now as the sales of US immobiles reached a new recording in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulences were underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they would be 650 jobs, or 4% of their world employees, in a measure to reduce cost losses in order to compare serious losses from their loss costs in the US Hypotheke crisis sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will be lost in London where the bank is employed by 1.500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrie Index was 331 points, or 2,55% to close 13,289,40, while the larger S&P 500 index increased at 2,65%.
In London the FTSE 100 index increased to 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close 6.306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standards.
Germany's Index Dax increased to 2.6% and France's CAC40 increased to 2.3%.
Previously, the reprise of credit pressure was undertaken on the markets after a strong demand to a hearing of Trimonats Garanties from the European Central Bank, granted to the European Trade Banks, was 4.7 per cent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the United States Central Bank and the European Central Bank, and seeks other capital markets in London, increased when the credit expenditure has increased the three-money "Libor" rates between the UK banks by 6.59% to its maximum since the late September, after a continuing increase since 21 November.
England faces the words of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, all of them almost so hard as the other.
Who's going to shoot in England in Candy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election Chairman, is at least under this special title, here to help the Chief Peter Moores and the Captain Michael Vaughan, and because the table of High Morries, the English director, is fully filled with applications for national electors, if not even for any part-time.
Those who do not ever receive the sixth position will be unfortunately, but life is often unjust and the sport is uncertain.
It's never easy to fix exactly what a man allows to reach the pieces of his professionals, while someone else never gets out of the lowest ring, sometimes from lack of chance.
It is not only in the cryket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are necessary, always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
This may also be asked in a further area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young leadership forces should be transported with good decisions that know the business.
Whoever can say what the right class is for a cricket player is unless it is given to him the opportunity to smile or undermine.
Of course, digits have a great impact on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player must take the eyes of the captain at the right time when he can take a wheel and a slaughter has to get regular opportunities on the order when he wants to print as an enormous cricket player.
The eyes of the choicers are more complex.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, as James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy for himself and how the wind comes into the network.
Anderson took 32 first-class wheels with 33 runs to win a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same sweet average, but both had their glass points and hope more.
If Shah or Bopara plays in the Asgiria Stadium, it may be just a question of view.
The choice could decide the career of both men, or maybe it makes little different.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and was successful in the first, with five wheels and 40 useful runs, but Paul Collingwood was still struggling to set up to create a significant test cricket player and that, although he had twice a hundred against Australian points, it may still be assessed.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion on the current network session in the Asgiria Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and building feelings for Shahs more experience on Bopara's youth enthusiasmation.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his funkelous and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is a 22 years old, and a excellent balance against rounded balls.
But Shah only made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West India in the test in Lord, his homematesan as a player from Middlesex, and this, as a result of his immediate refusal of the elections as Vaughan to return his position to the next game, seems to have taken the sweet from his shoes that still was open to Bombay.
On the contrary, all the tangents of Essex have evidently life rejoice.
He hasn't been impressed by nothing on a cricket room and his standing was taken on the point when he recently passed a vehicle with a four-way drive in an exhibition for England's Sponsor Volkswagen.
He experiences smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first he did was to get out his vodaphone (for example, also shocked) and to call his team college Alastair Cook that had watched this from the television, and to say with enthusiasm: "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he takes his medium-time with some effects here on the game fields, which seems to be suitable to him and shoots with confidence and sending.
Select the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe it's the actual art of selection.
I'm going to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be good if it suggests the teeping of Cylon, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Bus brings refugees back to work - and fighting Al-Quaida
The first shipping of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Bagdad yesterday with a electricity of distributors whose money or visa were exploded, and others hoped that the city returns to normality.
Some were even returned to fight the rebellion that they had spent out of their homes.
On Busbahnhof Mansour, before 800 people from Damaskus arrived in an official government convoi of a duty bus, the terminal was employed with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after she killed many doctors in Bagdad," said Sabah Al-Qubasi, a Sunnitic doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw in the TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Bagdad, and how it would be sure now."
They say that the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people," he said, in terms of the military club Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered to return his forces to the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old school teacher from the overwhelming sunnith part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he couldn't renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His sister neighbors in Amariyaah called him to tell him that a local military supported by the United States has contributed to leave Al-Qaida from its base in the west of the capital city, and he returned to return.
One of the new kongress from Jordan was the leader of a Sunnitic and Skitic stage, who was expelled from his house in Sleikh in the north of Bagdad, by a attack with handgranates after he requested his people to fight Al-Qaidas.
He was back to fight.
"Four two days, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaida Military in Sleikh and that they needed my support and my kids.
This is why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they were closed through the growing peace in the main city since the United States increased and the growth of local "related citizens", which were armed and defended their city quarters in cooperation with the American military.
But more were talking about being obliged to be home by means of visum problems and transferred money in Damaskus, where more than 1,3 million Iraqi were fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion under the Exilians that Nouri al-Maliki, the Chief Minister of the Syrian Government, had requested to defeat visa restrictions for refugees to force people to return.
More than two million people are probably fled from the seatric mortality weapons in the country.
"We visited Syrians well, and the government tried to give the Iraqi people no longer visa to force them back to Iraq," said the Sunnitic Rentner.
"I can't believe a government that supports the crimes that burned my house after I leave."
A part of the reason for the decline of violence is that Sunnites from smitic residences and circumvention have been distributed, which leaded to the creation of many places where shocks were left.
There are fears that a sudden stroke of refugees will be retreated by sectionary disappointments and will come to conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal country is leading to vocational training, even with the international orientation of its high schools.
Only in a field of education presss the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I've declared a 50th-year-old country that we're not French." - this slogan places the smallest federal state of self-ironic birthday to its 50th birthday.
This plays a great role in the Saarland education system, which is in the education monitor of the German Economic Institute Köln (IW).
So the high schools are already closely cooperating with the neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbridges was founded by the Frenchs in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their study with a double or even trifach diploma.
In this way, the share of foreign students is 15.6 per cent.
However, even the country children, the Saarland has a average number of high schools - many of them without an end in the Gymnasium.
"Im Saarland uses the training system", says Axel Plunnecke, education experts at IW.
More than each five-year-old teenage has the right to study at a professional school, so that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points over the federal average.
The combinations of vocational and academic training are also strongly developed.
Against the population number, the supply with two studies is the secondest in Germany.
In spite of practical training and increased demand, however, the number of engineer decisions have been covered by a third party in the past years.
As a result, the Saarlandian Education Ministry has undertaken high schools to a marketing campaign for Engineering workers.
"In the general educational schools we took some reforms after the first pisa study," said a speaker of the Ministry of Education.
The government thus introduced a country-wide comparison test.
In order to learn early children, the last year is free of charge - a model that can also copy in other federal countries.
Whether the performance of students will be sustainablely improved, future comparison studies will only be shown.
In Pisa 2003, the share of risk students was 29 to 20 percent.
However, the Saarland was not as strong as other federal countries.
The Bayerns better receive.
And for the distruction of the Saarlands, we cannot measure foreign language knowledge at Pisa - in this area we could be able to point out otherwise.
Because the language of neighbors is obligation to Gymnasia - even if the Saarlands are not French.
Chávez turns the watches
In Venezuela the clocks are first different than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez returns the Time Meteorology in South America for a half hours.
In Spain, Chavez is the witzfigur.
As the Venezuelan Official Journal reported, a new law will be placed at least four and a half hours on the world time.
This means that the South America State receives a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
The United States Feinly Chavez founded his decision, inter alia, that the United States of the world had been able to complete the distribution in time zones.
Furthermore, Chavez announced the decrease of relations with the neighborhood of Colombia on midnight (oriented time).
The link nationalist said, as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remained, he will not hold a relationship with the Head of State or the Columbian government.
"I can't already do this because of my worth," said Chávez, who provides a constitutional reform, which must vote on the oil citizens on Sunday in a referencedum.
With the reform, he would develop its power in the country clearly.
The ruler of the war was the decision of Uribes, Chavez, the mandate for negotiations with marxist rebels in Colombia, where it took place for the release of Geisels.
Uribe, with his decision "shooted in the face," had Chavez criticized on Sunday.
Chavez is also in Spain in all mouths.
A new phone club in the country for Furore: "Why not to call" (for you don't hold the mouth) calls the word that has already downloaded more than a million people from the Internet.
He spoke of his King Juan Carlos, King of Spain, who had been the most recent Ibero-American Committee of the permanent call of the link-populist and conducted this over the mouth.
German Drot 2007 Lohnminus
In spite of the strong conjuncture, German employees have threatened a real loss of salary in this year.
Experts called a whole set of reasons for their pessimist prognosis.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Bookler Foundation, the employees could actually receive less on the content account than in the previous year.
"Debt are the appropriate loan development, the increase in the tax increase and the price rates in food and energy", said Gustav Horn, the Institute for macroeconomic and Conjuncture Research.
New burdens could also be accompanied by unemployment insurance.
Minister of Financial Peer Steinbridge said the "New Osnabpresser Journal" planned decreasing the unemployment insurance of 3,3% for year change is proper and conscious in the current situation.
However, the Federal Working Agency should not be infringed to ask for credits or subsidies when the law is entitled, the SPD policyers was referred to.
On Thursday, the price explosion in food and mineral oil products was known at the highest level for 13 years.
The prices were totally 3,0 per cent in the year compared.
Venus is the full silling of the earth
In spite of its life-feined atmosphere, the Venus is more likely than ever thought: The European space Sond "Venus Express" has discovered blows in the atmosphere and windstorm on the Poland as it appears in the winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists smiled that it's breathing on Venus.
Now, the European son of "Venus Express" has shown the evidence - she showed electronic magnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lits on the Venus shoot in a height of about 56 km from Wolke to Wolke, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in Scientific Magazine "Natura".
According to the famous "Ursupen-Theorie", sleeves have led the life on the earth: the ocean should have reacted in the ocean, which leaded to the education of amino acids, the building stones of life.
Not so on Venus: "When there was a life there, it must have been in the very early history," Sean Solomon explained by the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today it should be a little living thing on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is around hundred times low than on the earth, ruining it under the temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil wheel of the earth, but she is a sliling," said Russian.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, has struck another development so deeply, is the question of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus' research, since the beginning of the ninety-years there was no more sounds to investigate this planet.
The latest research results currently presented in several "natural" articles are not only understood by researchers as to the uniqueness of Venus within the sun system.
"They also show that the communities of our neighbor planets are larger with the earth than first adopted," the Esa shares.
Thus the researchers found a wave structure in the southern pool, which turns more faster than the well known Webel wind in North Pool.
The phenomenon reminds the air streams of the Territory Wintermisphere, writes a research on Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrophysica Spacial and Cosmic.
The second-third planet of the sun system has almost the same mass as the earth and is with a diameter of 12.100 km almost exactly large.
The planet called morning or evening also created in about 225 days around the sun.
But he turns to himself more slower: a venturing takes 243 earthquakes.
Although the venus with surface temperatures of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bar is unlikely remembered on the earth, scientists believe that both planets have been in a very similar condition.
Both the water that remained on the earth in the Oceans, but on the Venus, it was lost in the world space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on the earth in carbonate stones, it makes the majority of the atmosphere on the venus.
Pohler defends Merkels meetings with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Kohler requests an end of the party party to receive Dalai Lama in the office of the Kanzleramt.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD because of their attacks on the officers after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Kohler is concerned about the view of Germany and has requested the great coalition to end the war against the receipt of Dalai Lama.
"We should not present the foreign world in this issue a separate nation," said Kohler to the trade board.
Similarly, the Cohler understanding for the receipt of Dalai Lama by Federal Cancer Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," he said Kohler.
Everyone knows that Germany should be real sensible balances in the foreign policy, emphasized the Federal President, but took a mark of protection before the project, which is a new Chinese policy.
"The federal government has not taken away from the traditional chinese policy.
That also knows China," Kohler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly identified the receipt of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by several Unions.
Steel Meyer, among other things, was accused of the Union's "Creational Main Policy" in the foreign policy.
After receiving Dalai Lamas in the Canzleramt, there were strong irritations in German and Chinese relationships.
Thus the Chinese leadership has not only downloaded the German Financial Minister Peer Steinbridge (SPD), but also the so-called strategic dialogue of the Foreign Ministers of both countries.
China's government chief Wen Jiabao has now requested the federal candidate Angela Merkel to be receiving Dalai Lamas as an error.
China rejects it when European politicians receive the religious leaders of Tibet, and confirmed the Chinese position in Jiabao.
The acts and words of Dalai Lamas showed that he tried to depart from China from Tibet and the other Tibeth region, which also include other provinces today.
Shortly warns before claws like in France
Railways with the police, shoes, shooting cars: Wolfgang Schauble warns against crowns like in France.
It should be done to ensure that social inadequacy in Germany is not in violence on the road, the Federal Minister called for.
Barricad burned, Randalier shooted the police with shoot fleet: After the serious young slaughter in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schauble (CDU) fears similar development in Germany.
"We need to take care of the fact that we do not build social pollutant with us and depend on violence.
We need to take it seriously," he said the "new press in Hannover".
Not every young man comes to the rapid change of social reality.
Bounds, countries and communities have already worked with emphasis on reducing problems, said shauble.
This is not only the integration of migrants.
"Towards the integration gap to the Islamic Conference, the first success has already been shown."
However, for warning it is too early.
It also pointed out that there are not urban and social problems such as in France, in German cities.
In the northern fronts of Paris, young people had severe streets with the police last night.
In Toulouse, also burned cars and public buildings.
Best integration efforts of the Federal Government requested the President of the Turkish Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the clawle in France, Kolat warned "the effects of post-function".
The situation in Germany is not so brising as in France.
But it is best for action.
Colat pointed out that the unemployment rates in young people with migrations under 25 years were "intermediately high".
In particular, it should be provided for more training.
Colat stressed: "We must give the youth a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than a social control was placed in France.
Many young people with migrations did not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "But yet, we have to watch."
Young people should "approximately give the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Instead, it remained quiet in the Paris term Villiers-le-Bel in the night.
Hundreds of the police were in use, a shooter overlooked the area with shoes.
The competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as a number of shooting cars and cars.
Since the Sunday, a remise of around 1000 security forces is for peace.
The police will take as long as it was necessary, Mr Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the president.
On Tuesday night at Krawalls in Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured.
In the next eighth, the unruthing were overcome to Cœdès.
The Krawale condemned a traffic accident in which two young people lived on Sunday.
After the first recognition of the State Authority, the police does not make a debt for the death of the youth.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke
The reality-free involvement of the Chairman documents that the coalition is content at the end - and that nothing is expected by its own.
In what country these federal candidates are actually living?
After their conviction in the general debate of the Federal Day, which was wise and content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which has finally been registered by her.
The project that it is too much concentrating on the foreign policy, Angela Merkel reacted with a argest strict text.
This is provincial, she said and showed that she did not want to understand what the critics are.
In the Federal Day, it has documented all recognisable as regards its provision.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented himself: a decreased politician who runs to the foreign policy and remains in danger.
For example, climate protection: Because it is inevitable for the decisions of holy dam, it does not say how climate objectives should be achieved here.
On the other hand, the self-love - so uncertainty, the CDU Chief hadn't been injured two years ago.
Now she's crying to the fleet that the resurrection comes to the people.
Thus she damages her image as a Pragmatician who solve the problems instead of playing the world.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, internal political problems are a border appearance.
Children's braveness and the concerns of the pregnant managers?
A few sides have the rest of it.
It's noted how often she spends when it comes to the kids attack.
Three switchs need a feature in order to get out of a halfway switch.
It's like a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attaque Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican Presidency candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Middle Romney have been a hard slaughter - and they now have to be afraid of a foreign candidate.
The enlargement of the candidates is already decisive in the first issue.
He made New York a "refugee place for illegal immigrants" in Middle Romney proposes his counterparty Rudy Giuliani.
This calls on his side with serious predictions: "I would say that his own house was a port for illicit," said Giuliani, and offers the former Governor of Massachusetts, privacy of immigrants without papers.
The candidates blew to attack: because the Republican Base has no clear preferences, the eight Presidents use the debate on CNN, especially to discrete their opposers.
The autorouted 30 seconds videos sent by the Internet users via YouTube are little more than stylingers.
"In this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain proposes his opposite Ron Paul, who calls for an immediate departure from Iraq as the only one in the round.
Romney also receives the Levites from Vietnam when he refuses to condemn the so-called "watterboarding", a hearing method that is simulated at the earthquakes as a torturer.
However, that the important topics of the campaign in the area of Iraq's wars and post-debates show the reactions of the Sale publisher in St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are denied and future tax increases are declined, the audit will be marked in case.
This shows more than one thing where the weaknesses of the two favorites are.
"I've been missing at that time," Romney says, "and he's putting in front of the base and television publication, for which he was still belonging to the departure officers in 1994.
However, Giuliani comes to the students when he is asked to explain the Bible.
Musharraf first registered in Zivil
One day after his return as the army chief, the Pakistani Machaber Musharraf was sentenced as President.
By the end of the eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was dedicated to another five-year office on Thursday.
The Pakistani television has survived the Zeremonia in the presidency of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf pleaded to observe the Constitution and act in the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had sent his office as the army chief to his confidence Ashfaq Kiyani, and was taking an international pressure in particular from the United States.
Eight years after his maturity in an unbelievable military pound, the former General now has been the first time as civilian head.
With his retreat as the head of the forces of the forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a nuclear requirement for the opposition and Western.
Another central demand is the end of the exception, which Musharraf had paid on November 3th.
Shortly after his defence, Musharraf will, according to the general lawyer Malik Muhammad Qayum, decrease the exceptional status and thus comply with another demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the country, which Musharraf had sent to him after the departure of the exemption at the beginning of November with him, had dismissed all the claims against the distorted revocation of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Instead, five soldiers were killed in the northern Stamm region of the North-Waziristan at a attack on a military convoi, and four more injured.
According to an armed speaker, the bomb explosed on a street near the borders to Afghanistan.
The fathers of the crowd back
Germany's Super Group of Seventyrs again: the three band members of Harmonia renewed their console at a concert in Berlin.
Revival appears a average of its great time "Leive 1974".
Soon in that time, they were significantly famous in the island.
The adjusted sense is then suitable in Geestalt three gentlemen at the night table.
Everyone has his chest before himself, his cable and especially his head.
Dieter Moses turned in the swimming crowd with 63 years in the midst.
Links flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and in possession of Laptop and Guitarre.
The right, regarded by the audition, is focused on the console by Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73.
Everyone takes kitchens, including a beat.
And sometimes it's fascinated to add it to a typical piece of music.
This seems to be not to defeat the ladies itself.
What the band Harmonia re-musics has been made by Krautrock's favorite buyers for some receptions.
There may be an enthusiasm: targeted demands show that the name, although by the collective pop memory, was no longer so sustained in order to deteriorate this band for 32 years.
But why should the German also not celebrate his lively legends from the seventy-years?
Another time, what is called unreductive Krautrock, in England and America remained more than in its own country.
When the music economy was able to survive the Kölner Group Can 2003 the Echo Prize for Life Work, the German pope viewers were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Laudatio was still thanks to the bands La Düsseldorf and New!, the surprise did not know any borders.
With the concerts, Michael Rother later took up with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the bridge as a old partner.
The problem of the home ignorance and the declaration in the foreign is one.
The memory is therefore overwhelmed with Harmonia because the trio was only two years and in this time also a lower effect force was depleted than the other.
Mosebius and Roedelius were musicated with the artist Conrad Schnitzler before.
First, we were playing in the helmet under the Berlin shoes.
Then in Düsseldorf, because of economic reasons for a plate-label maintained by the church.
Rother had shortly equipped with electricity work and then became a guitarist at New! who might be the rootest German group who played a call.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians to the exil to the Forest in Weserbergland.
There, in the old Weserhof, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as urban communities.
Any ideologically than in the community I, where Roedelius was still as children.
Before in a split-good artist.
At first in the sperrmole, there was also a name of the charming covenant Harmonia Ottenstein and for the art.
Some were able to have Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because so leave and cut music too, the band lied material notion.
The trip collection did not serve alone in self-defect.
The current "Live 1974" CD was communicated in a concert in Greece, before a nearly 50-popular record class, how somebody believes to disappear.
From Rother at that time the desire to strengthen and deal with harmony.
For Roedelius and Moebius, an unsuccessful requirement.
The band explained its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Estoteric-Spherics and secured his existence with alben as "flamming hearts".
Cluster was re-established in the eighth and is more successful than it was Harmonia.
The Great Livealbum is to thank Herbert Greenemeyer.
The Grönland's plate company has aimed to impose the Krautrock as a urgent German contribution to life music.
New! has already been buried like Roedelius Solowork.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia is located in the Berlin house of the world's cultures.
Publicly subsidied, under the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Alt Pointk and publisher of the book "Krautrock sampler".
There's also the Love Parade Researcher Dr. Motte.
The whole band width of the effects of the clawtrock would be circulated to the following popmusic.
From Harmonia is filled with the leisure of the supergroup.
The word of Brian Eno spends with the most separate sound in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are images showing the producers with Harmonia in the farmer stage.
The legend training will provide projections to further black-foots by weighted devices.
That's why the three veterinaries are refined with improving.
Not anymore, by closing microphones to the orgel and to the slaughter device, to discover the instruments that are built over itself, unexpected tones.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in technically developed smokers.
Daran doesn't change the home's chor.
Under the guide Barbara's morningsters, it is sweet and sweet and in a beautiful place with Emphase "Ayaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about Rock.
The roots were searched less in the blue than in music schools (Can), technologies (Kraftwork) or in the refugee against artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who calls "'68!" has not completely unjust, and Harmonia does not allow it to take out of peace now.
The most comprehensive thing is to be overwhelmed on the shoes.
Where's music starting and when does it open?
This can make the nervous or flight moments great luck.
Richard Gere isn't just cynic enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Producing Peace" two films are re-established with the Balkan war.
But both do not believe it.
Or the concepts place too much on action and ballers, or they are too shockable.
There can't help Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party."
The good news first: since war offenders Karadzic and Mladic are still hidden in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, in the dark part of the Bosnian Krie, the player Richard Gere is now recovered.
We had recently lost the most beautiful man of the huge years, because there are too many good-free-free roles in women's welfare films and too many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, Richard Gere is the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - If the jugger is going to be shoot" (Why the film titles today must always be as long as the local leader contracts?) maybe.
He provides a wonderful exhibition: On the basis of his war reporter Simon Hunt, his war was taken, what could be from the gere if the squeeze and the film industry weren't so worthy: a man who has his best time behind himself, but he himself has saved as a ruinable thinking of his decline even more important remaining of the unique charm.
But despite this trumpet, "The Hunting Party" together with the German "Producing Peace", which also begins in this week, is only the unfinished number of Balkan war films.
With the "Producing Peace" you can make a short process: the film acts of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), which save a serbin before cosovaric heavy protections, whereas the one still loves it.
Although it is grateful that the Serbs are not even represented as the only roots of all evils, the foreign film is still too fast in ballers and action.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without autobahs, but war.
However, the Hunting Party can just explore why it has never given a good balkan film.
The story of three US Crystal reporters, who were able to find the Serbian Supreme War Force Defense "the Fuchs", would be possible to be a new "Apocalypse Now" at a time.
Because the stories are shocking: Both times they go small teams in the forest to fill something that the militarys can't, and both times it will be a trip to the skin.
One of the reasons for the disappearing of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt can't just be the deceased cyniker with the heart when he's being presented at the beginning.
No, the script needs to disappear him another romantic business with a muslim bosnian killed later.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes back to the bath when the reporters arrive in the past five minutes in the time-care procedure, what Nato, CIA and all the injuries in the world haven't done in five years: the war offenders were slaughtered and the Muslim bossers left to rush fairly.
This is so bad that we want to call the International Court of Justice in Den Hague for crimes against cineological crimes.
The movie has a most human concern.
He wants to insist that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the Frenchs (which they should very closely) that persecution is not to be intensive because of secret political negotiations.
But the good assembly and the wicked are sometimes so similar that a famous right grace comes in the sense.
It says about the wood mask of a Asian demon on the work table of the teeth: "I'm feeling to see the shooted snakes, otherwise: how strict it is to be wicked."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have precisely such sweet heads, but sweet how exciting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genes of the Balkan war film.
The newspaper reported that all Irak films Hollywoods were great fleps.
You can add: it has never given a good movie in South Africa.
It is always applicable: If a star is on the world's heritage or mining fields, then something comes out like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "All all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blut Diamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all conflicts are just too close to time.
It had to pass for decades before Hollywood was able to turn a good film over the holocaust.
Some films may still be rifed - the Vietnam's worker now as classics "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Fulll Metal Jackett" are no way to celebrate as master works.
But we may know today where every mass murder in real time comes home to the same two screens, even too much over the conflicts of the world.
And this shocks the Drehbookers the uncertainty that it needs to tell good stories.
"It or no" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know how bad the nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to do good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcastic distance artist of the Romancist Lawrence Norfolk.
When the parallel between his historical Roman "Lemprières Worder book" and the Balkan War was asked, he said, "This is only that some things never changed.
Major cities will always be terrible, people will always be murdered in a graceful way and will rule war in Yugoslavia."
Detailed Critics for Olympia Absage
The shift of the Citizensman's complaint of Hamburg for Olympic summer games has been a huge critical in policy and economy.
Many want to continue to fight on the water games.
However, the realism is able to approve the possibilities.
The main business manager of the Hamburg Trade Chamber, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called a "not good for the economic position" at midnight.
No other project has recently developed so many motivations in the city as the Olympiaides.
" Without this goal, the sport policy cannot be maintained in the same measure."
Schmidt Trinity requested the Senate to not raise the project, but to find a new long-term approach towards "it is out of a changed time track".
Citizen Ole de Beust remained at previous speech, which was at least unrealistic in Hamburg until 2028.
"Don't Hamburg decide on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sport Unit," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out to the decision of the Sport Competing for Munchen's application for winter games at the beginning of December 2018.
"This preference means that we have no realistic opportunities for the period that we have until 2028 thought."
However, if the dream wasn't dreamed for all the time, he said by Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the comments of Beusts.
This is the impression that Hamburg does not want to demand for Olympic games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to build a chance by making the plans already at this time," said HSB Chairman Nate Ploß at midnight.
An infringement to the complaint is also in contravention to the sentence of the Head of Senate due to a receipt of the full Assembly of the German High School Association.
There has been the request for Hamburg for the university 2015 "not as a replacement" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The High School Sport Association had just been appointed as a candidate city in Hamburg last week.
The SPD Citizenship Group proposed the Senate to have not used a valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the small Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because he set on the map of Olympia and has declared the building of the apartment", said the SPD, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the small Grasbrook has always requested an integrated planning for Olympia and a later residence use, the CDU has set on the "Event Factor".
The request for the Olympic summer games 2012 had been a great deal in Hamburg at the time.
However, Hamburg was a Leipzig failure.
It's not warhol's kitchen
Who connects the terms Swedish and wood wood, thinks of Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or?
Currently manufactured wood wood shoes are made in Sweden on Warhol's work directory.
A majority of the ninety Brillo boxes listed there from the "Type Stockholm" are false.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" just a few months ago, doubts about the reality of Andy Warhols Brillos Boxs of 1968, internal research at the modern museum in Stockholm now comes to an exciting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", the former museum director Pontus Hultén, the modern museum 1995, has been discovered, are copies - and most of the hundreds of other Brillo boxes of the "Typ Stockholm", which are on the international market.
The history is devastated, a confusing packing of artistic and curatorical productions.
Warhol, in New York, created his first "Brillo-Boxes" wood boxes, which are based on the red blue design of the "Brillo".
A exhibition of his works in the modern museet 1968 - with Warhols understanding - was provided by hundreds of Brillo kitchen from Pape: These (from expenses) not from Warhol but were provided directly from the Brillo Carton Fabric.
It was not the art works, but their illustrators, a simple exhibition.
At the same time, Warhol was likely authorized to make some little brillo hole knifes in Sweden who were not issued in the modern museum.
Periods now speak of about fifty kitchen, which have now been authorised as original Andy Wall-Brillo boxes with the title "Type Stockholm" right into the history of art and auction.
Some of them have reached more than $1000,000 at auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later has noted that it had been produced and issued for hundreds of wood clergy in Sweden, which then left warhol.
In fact, Hultén's 105 guests were produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time Warhol was dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at the modern museum, has also studied three of Swedish private possession boxes, two of which were prepared in Stockholm in 1968: your press pants were just based and shooted, then white oil colored with a paint.
The structure of copy from 1990, however, is that the color with a sleeve without base, directly on the press panel - and it is not oil, but a acryl color.
"They were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillos," says the director of the modern museet Lars Nittve, "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the modern museum will classify the six customers in its collection as copies/exposition material."
Once in July, the Authentication Board has announced freely to follow the "shirt accused" which will be raised in matters of the seventy-powder kitchen.
However, there is an insufficient smell.
Give rebellious soldiers in Manila
On the Philippines, rebellious soldiers who were in a hotel in Manila and requested President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He couldn't answer blood injuries, said the director Antonio Trillanes, who offered President Corruption and election punishment, reporters in the hotel.
Government troops were formerly designed by the hotel under ring gas.
The twenty-five soldiers have been distant in the building for hours.
The half of them were on Thursday because of a deceived slaughter in 2003 before the court, among them, Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to immediately stop with around 30 sympathies.
The military police, who had to watch him, were apparently overlooked to him and closed to his mastership.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and requested President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyale government struggles departed the area from the preceding hotel.
The President held a urgent meeting of the SecurityCabinet.
The national security advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"The people have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call people to connect us."
General Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the Elite Unit of Scout Rangers, said that other armed units wanted to join the march.
The government critics were calling for great demonstrations against the President on Friday.
Your government has been overwhelmed by corruption proposals for months.
Manilas Financial District was already the main spectrum of the trials of about 200 militaryians against Arroyo.
The resurrection ruled after about 24 hours after the refusal of the army to connect.
Since 1986, at the Philippines, at least seven pounds of democratic governments had been held.
