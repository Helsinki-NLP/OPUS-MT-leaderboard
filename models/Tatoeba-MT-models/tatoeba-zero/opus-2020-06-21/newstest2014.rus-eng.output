In Kenya and in the region, two men have ended their life of self-assault
One of the employees has already tried to suicide.
On October 30, about 1-00, in the village of Lugová, on its place of residence, 1947, a man was born with self-assault.
It's known that he's already undertaking sozide attempts.
What did a man like this step not known.
On October 31, in 11 to 50, the lives of a 41-year-old man, who lived in Kinezhma, ended.
The names of violent death were not found, reports the Press of the MOWD "Kineshem".
You got a black box in your car?
While American projects are trying to find money for the repair of the shocking road system, many start to see a decision in a small black box, which is attractively equipped with your car rental.
These devices monitoring each passed car hire and transfering the information to the officials are in the centre of the opposite attempt to modernize the US car financing system taken by Washington and the State.
Normally, an unexpected automobile planning area was unexpectedly generated intensive debates and colonial aliens.
The Liberians joined the environmental groups in the lobstering of the right to the Government to use small cups for monitoring the numbers of your traveling miles and, perhaps, even where you are going to them, and then use this information when collecting tax accounts.
The cheese movement is shocked.
The American Civil Freedom Union is also deeply concerned and has a number of issues of privacy.
And although the conventions can not agree, continue or not, several States are not expected.
They think about how the drivers can go through the next decade to the system in which they pay for every miles of road they go.
Thousands of passengers have already tested these black balls, parts of which are a satellite shipment function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“ This is not the issue we may have the right to elect,” said Hasan Ihret, Executive Director of the Government Association of South California, who prepares plans for the start of monitoring the authorities of the state mile drivers of each califoric automobilist, until 2025.
It will be changed in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology for this is already available.
The need for this is to reduce the absence of funds in the Government's fund for the fund of the shooting roads financed for taxes funded by the United States on cars.
Americans haven't sell so much benzine as ever.
Automotives walk more than a mile to a gallery.
The federal tax, 18.4 cents per galon, has not been increased for 20 years.
Politicals do not want to increase taxes even to one center at high prices of benzine.
“ The benzine tax is simply impossible,” said Le Manich, a transport policy experts at the University of Minnetosco.
His State has recently established 500 monitoring devices for testing the wrong payment system.
“ This will be the best alternative in a long - term perspective, ” he said.
It's called the wrong user payment.
It is unexpected that this idea affects urban liberalities, as taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce the slower road and gas emissions, for example.
Planning bodies in California are emphasized to this system in developing strategies for the achievement of the ambitious objectives of the State to combat global heat.
However, members of the Palestinian Chamber of Bill Schulster (Republic, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Chairman of the Palestinian Transport Committee, said that he also considered the system as a long-term alternative.
Reason's free market commitments are also in a deterioration from making drivers pay for each miles.
“ This is not just a tax that will be in the black dark, ” said Edward Mur, vice-president on political affairs Reason.
People pay for their receipt.
This movement is also supported by two former ministers of the United States of Transport, which called for the conventions to move towards a wrong payment in 2011.
The United States Senate has approved the pilot project of $90 million in which about $10,000 would participate.
However, representative leaders rejected this proposal because of the fears of agricultural lawyers representing elections whose daily life should often travel a lot of miles to get to work or to the city.
Many states and cities, however, are on their own way.
The largest enthusiasm is shown in the state of Oregon, where 5000 drivers are attracted to the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for a mile walk instead of the benzine tax.
The pilot project in Nevad is closed.
He's in New York.
Illinois tries it on a limited basis with the participation of shipping cars.
And the I-95 coalition, including the 17 East Coast Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studys how they will be able to make these changes.
This concept did not receive a general recognition.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteers cars had recently been covered by these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could follow each step.
“Abusiveness towards a large brother and such things represents a great problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who conducts strategies and effective management in the Nevad State Transport Department.
That wasn't what people wanted.
When testing the full step, the United States Civil Liberty Office in Nevad warned on its website: “They will not be difficult to convert these devices into full-scale machines.”
There is no need to create a huge, sound technological infrastructure that will be inevitably expanded to store records on daily movements of individual citizens.
There is a several states in which difficult search for an incursive technologie, which would allow state authorities to take account of the cars traveling, but without the location and time information.
If you can do this, Han said, the society will feel more calm.
Search for this technology brought some state agency to a young company in California, named True Mileage.
This company had not been helping the State tax collection.
She tried to go to the development of the type of car traffic, where drivers were paid on the basis of the switch.
But the device that it tests is attached to road projectors because they do not use GPS and provide a limited number of information that is periodically downloaded by modem.
“They will be more strict to do this if you do not follow their speed and do not follow their position,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director True Mileage.
There were a number of major errors in some of these pilot programmes.
There is a lot of less precious and less encouraging ways to do so.
The projects are experiencing with the delivery of various options to drivers.
They can select a device from or without GPS.
Or they can totally disappear from the device instead of paying a fixed collection based on the average number of miles, which all the people of the State are going to be.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea of a careful public, putting the device to do more than less.
In New York, transportation officials are trying to develop a loan device that will also take payment for parking accounts, to provide “payments” insurance and to collect a pool of speed in the real time mode from other drivers that could be used to avoid switching.
“Autobiists will join the benefits that they offer,” says in the graphic projecting document.
Some transport system projects, however, consider whether it is not all false payment discussions that are just a huge factor.
In the City Transport Commission, the employees of San Francisco said that the conventions could be very simple to overcome the banking of the Swedish Road Construction Fund, taking up benzine taxes.
Additional temporary or annual tax could be able to spend from hybrid vehicle drivers and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of benzine to pay their fair share.
“ There is no need to be a radical surgery when everything you need to do is accepting aspirin,” said Randy Rentshler, director of the Legislation and Public Relations Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private life and many other things.
EU will prepare measures to support Ukraine for Russia's economic pressure
The European Union has a reserve plan for Ukraine's gas and, as a result of the agreement with the IIF on extreme credit, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of the Agreement on Association between the EU and the Ukraine Summit.
The FMI has conducted negotiations on stand-by credit, and the other EU official, directly participating in the negotiations, added that it was the purpose of the conclusion of the agreement in the nearest time.
In addition to the potential appropriation of the UKM, Ukraine may receive 610 million euros from the EU itself.
Reyter's analysis doubts that Ukrainian and IWF are able to overcome long-term differences in the financing conditions.
It does not believe that reforms needed to receive assistance, and the International Research Agency of Ukrainian Sovereign Railway to one step - to "V" from "V".
However, the representatives of the EU say that IFF could prove flexibility in credit conditions, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the EU ' s financial support plan, there is a reserve option to ensure Ukraine ' s gas, which provides part of the supply now from Russia.
It may be a gas from the Green River or a reverse from Swedish.
Lastly, according to the officials, it is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia is "isolated" of Ukraine.
Analytics believe that such a reverse delivery in Ukraine can be used only for a few weeks and may lead to a reduction in other regions.
"The countries of the EU and the Ukraine are negotiations on the way to create favourable conditions to enable Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," added Rachel.
Russia outside the fight against the pollution of cars
The attempt to solve the transport problems of large cities was observed in most world megapolis from the second half of the X seventh century.
Normally, it was on their restructuring and enlargement, or attempts to reduce the demand of cars, number of cars and time of use.
The example of Singapore is well known, where a heavy quantity of the growth of private cars has been introduced, and the right to purchase is purchased in acquisitions.
His price may exceed the price of its auto two-third times.
The European cities, including London, have paid payment for the entry into the centre of the city.
In Germany, such green zones, such as Hamburg and Stuttgarte, are introduced, where the entry is permitted only by vehicles with a certain ecoclass that uses fuel high quality (including biocarbons or electronics).
Agency for the Environmental Protection of Beijing, for example, approved the "five-year air plan" over 250 billion ($40 billion).
According to the Director of the Municipal Environmental Protection Office, Peenna Li Quinchenng, the main objective of five-year-old air pollutants, reduced by 20 to 35 per cent to 2017, increased number of private cars to the level of 6 million (that's 5,2 million) and increased by more than 5 per cent of the use of car rentals in one vehicle.
According to the Agency, there is now 22.5 per cent of the global air pollution in Beijing.
In particular, the main steps of the programme are the limitation of the use of car transport, and the introduction of additional taxes for automobile employees.
Moreover, the urban " green-five" measures include rapidly compared to the rest country of the fuel stations, the establishment of local vehicles and brandmarking systems and vehicles, the introduction of vehicles in the central part of the city, the prohibition of the use of installed vehicles (e.g. the establishment of the promotional financial programs for old vehicles to Hybrid or electronic vehicles), the development of electronic transport (including public and services), the public transport development (e.g. high growth).
The number of car rental innovations also includes the prohibition for all private cars to move within the Fifth Rail (all in the KNR's capital 6) one day in week (complianced information contains the number of vehicle marks) and the extradition of a low-based lottery car (e.g., 2011, the first year of the lote, the number of authorisations for private vehicles in Beijing was only third when 2010).
According to the existing programme " Environment Safety for 2012-2020 " the number of cities with high and very high air pollution must be reduced to 128 (in 2012 were 138).
The Minoproduce reports that in 2011, 41 per cent of the emissions of pollutant substances in the urban atmosphere had been derived from the “transition sources”.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are 10 times higher industrial, and in San Petersburgh nine times.
The RF is only starting to consider the possibilities of restricting cars on the streets.
The Director of the Economic and Transport Policy Institute, WSE Mihail Blinkin, believes that administrative and physical measures aimed at demanding to car renounce, are often unpopular, and they may only be adopted in accordance with the fullest universality of them.
In the case of Moscow, a unique problem related to the structure of its car, where two classes are lowly sensitive to any regulatory effects - service and personal cars, and the "accepted" users, which are at least 200 000. (or 5 per cent of the total number of Moscow cars).
At the day of the ECOM Center, urbanists in San Petersburgh have prepared a study analysis of the balances of urban areas between the housing building, the road coverage area and the number of cars.
The main conclusions of researchers: the city centre is two times less required, and most of the cars in the center are not using cars every day, leaveing them on parking or just on the streets.
It is therefore proposed to build a park not a park, but the car storage, not expanding, but a reducing part of the road (when the roads are more friendly for the coasts) and to limit the use and location of personal transport in the borders of the historical centre (the common territory of about 3212 g, which covers several central areas of the city).
Strategy for an unlawful trade in Wlogde will grow at times
In view of the urban authorities, the increase in the strip size is helping to spend in Uganda and free the streets from natural plates and lots.
Most commercialists are not paying taxes that they are doing, often not being conducted by the conciliation of sanitary control.
And that means that health is threatened.
Similarly, the lower limit for citizens for an unlawed trade in November is six times - from 500 rules up to 3000 rules, reports the Office of Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned the risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned the growing risks for the main driver of Russian consumption.
This is mainly the crisis of inconsistent consumer credits and the massive reductions of employees.
Our main concern now is not what the growth has been delayed, but the structure of this growth is likely.
Lastly, he was fully consumptioned by the consumption that is almost not enhanced by trafficking,” said the main economist Goldman Sachs on Russia Clemens Grafe, representing the fourth report on Russian economy.
Now the nominal growth in Russia is about 10 per cent.
In inflation by 6 per cent, it is possible to ensure the future consumer demand at the current level, expected at Goldman Sachs.
But the rentabilities of Russian companies fall, so they may probably take the optimization of staff costs.
Today, we see a significant growth in GDP payments: if payments increased by 10 per cent, the GDP is only 2 per cent, Mr. Grafe explained.
The company was confronted with a reduction in retailability.
If it doesn't grow, it can lead to disabilities and the growth of unemployed people.
The main economist Barclays Capital for Russia and the SNG Vladimir Pantushin cannot be paid.
Democracy near historical minimums, high competition for employees.
In order to move staff from the part or keep the current staff, the employees must take up the payment.
Russia's support needs are living and a very rapid growth in consumption.
Mr. Grafe believes that this type of credit is not provided because of the extremely high rates of consumer use in the economy.
" We have not seen the uses of the economy from the growth of consumption, the money is not divided into the economy, and the same banks are returned to the same percentage payment," said the economicist.
But the problem is that Goldman Sachs expects the growth of uncertain credits.
They are in the main of the heavenly people who have nothing to provide.
Ratios in such a job are high.
As a result, they're not often returning," said Mr. Grafe.
The second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is, therefore, the possible crisis of inconsistent credits.
The Director of the Bank Institute of the WSE Vasilie Sorocks is now seeing the signs of the bank crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to deficiencies in the gusbans, have been obliged to allocate the population resources under high percentage.
In response to the guests, the wars went and began to reduce credit rates, the economicist continues.
Small credit organizations can not be issued in the same percentage, otherwise they will have a negative rate of percentage.
If the guests aren't dismissed from the defense, Russia threatens the full bank crisis, and trusts the Vasilie Sorocks.
A number of bank licenses in the last weeks of the economicist is considered a predict of the mass.
The head of the institute warns that “asset insurance system has not been initially calculated on the system crisis”.
However, the growth of the consumption is delayed without the crisis, believe in the investment bank, due to the renewal of the index of guests and military salaries set out in the current version of the budget.
Partial consumption shock will be decreased by natural monopolies (and, as a result, reducing inflation).
However, only partly, if investments are not increased (which does not see help), the growth of the consumption is still slow, certain in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantoshin from Barclays Capital is not seeing a presupport for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still a decline of oil prices," he says.
According to its assessment, the Russian economy will begin to reduce the cost of oil below $90.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CIA had not yet been able to reduce economic rates.
The paradoxical image is observed: inflation has decreased, and the banks began to upload rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the CIA, announcing an inflation targetization,” said Clemens Grafe.
The percentage policy on market rates does not affect only the interbank credit rates.
"It's all the hopes for the CB," he estimated Clemens Grafe.
Banks are not used for economic credits, but for the management of their liquidity
When the rate is decreased, the currency is immediately changed, it means that the means are trying to go to the speculation against the rubber.
"The CB is understood that this strategy does not work", said Mr. Grafe, and recalled that the rule of "free payment" was planned by the State until the end of 2015.
But it should be necessary to do this before or to upload the key rate of the BC (5.5%).
According to his evaluation, the rubber rate is now up to 10 per cent.
I'm driving only one way - weak, expert out.
But if the CIA imposes some shadows of doubt that the elimination of the currency rabbit is not part of the rule deficiency policy, it may defeat the rule of a lot more stronger.
In Chelabinsk II, the peoples of Southern Urala arrived.
The Forum has been joined to the National Unity Day, 400-year-old Russian State reconstruction and 20-year-old adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
Delegations from all cities and areas, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious conventions, legislative and executive bodies, were generally complicated by about 350 persons.
The Curse forum aims at strengthening international agreement.
We can show the example of not only the other regions but also the other countries.
We don't have differences and differences.
We live in full understanding," says Phiophan, controlled the Chelabian and Zelutous.
In the meeting, a number of issues, including the education of patriotics, cultural cooperation.
The results of the seat have been adopted by the resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in the operating theatre and ballet.
There was opened the exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Tyrbian area.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany in the case of U.S. expertise
Edward Snowden, the U.S. Intelligence Discover, said he was ready to go to Berlin to give an German Parliament if the United States National Security Agency and his Director of Kit Alexandre could not respond to his activities.
The German Deputy Hans-Cristian Strewbel, on Friday, met Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he was provided for assurance in order to discuss his showing in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, who presented the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “The results of my efforts were clearly positive, my Government continues to deal with an incoherence as a change and is trying to criminalize the political statements of criminal accused that have no protection.”
However, the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States ' s government to reject criminal accusions against him.
The accused of the Ministry of Justice of the United States includes the spy and the ruling of public property.
Hans-Peter Fridrich, Minister of Internal Affairs of Germany, reported Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German officials, we will find ways to do this".
The relationship between the United States and Germany was stressed after the approval that ANB had heard the phone of the Officer Angela Merckel.
Thomas Opperman, deputy in the parliamentary group, who was smoking, said that if there is a possibility to hear Mr. Snowson as a witness, “no matter of danger and not devastating relationship with the United States”, it should be used.
Mr. Streebel, a parliamentary from the Green German Party, published his photo with Mr. Snowden in his Twitter.
During the visit, two German journalists were sent to Russia.
Mr. Streebel said that Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he was gone.
If Mr. Snowden had shown in Germany, he would need to ensure that he would be “in security”, said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he was confronted with the “small and permanent” campaign that tried him to leave his house.
However, he said he was encouraged by the world’s response to “the political expressions”.
Citizens throughout the world, and high-speaked officials, including in the United States, believed that the deployment of a comprehensive system of comprehensive control is useful for society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities, “forever the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved.”
Frontier Airlines will spend the payment for the handle
Frontier Airlines plans to take off passengers to $100 for they're taking a handle board on their board.
Frontier Airlines plans to get up to $100 for handle and $2 for coffee or gas, although their statement in the middle stated that passengers would be able to leave the whole bank.
The new payment is distributed in the top bag residues, so small tubes situated under the seat remain free.
Frontier said that it would be $25 if the collection was paid before, and $100 if the travellers would be paid only when they were in charge.
The representative of Frontier Kate O'Melly said that the $100 payment should make passengers care for the payment.
“ We don’t want to pay for that, ” she said.
The Abia Corporation began to pay for the first and second payment in the bag in 2008.
The passengers who try to avoid these collections kill as much as they can, in the hands placed on the top of the bag residues, because they are often missing.
Congregations are one of the ways to put passengers less on board.
O'Melly said that this new collection wasn't actually for money.
The case is that the most faithful clients of Frontier claim that the location in the top bag retreats is increasingly difficult.
The passengers who buy tickets on the airline should not be paid.
This means that one passenger in the frontier trip may have a chance to pay a taxpayer free, while the next passenger may pay $100 for the same tax.
O'Melly said that the change of the website procedures and on the base of the Frontier registration would ensure that passengers will know about the collection before they go to the seat.
The new collection of Frontier on the handle will not begin to start up to the summer, although the date is not yet established.
The passengers are often complained of payment for bags and other collections, but the aircrafts love them.
They claim that the loan processing has money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many of the Wall Street consider the addition of bagage collections to know that airlines have enough money to cover aircraft costs after a few years of loss.
However, most of them did not relate to meetings for handling.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection for a handle three years ago, and another talker, Allegiant Air, later followed her example.
The only other aircraft company with such a collection is the venerian Wizz Air, said a aircraft adviser to Jay Sorensen, which is carefully monitoring additional collections.
According to his evaluation in the report of December 2011, the collection of the handle provides $50 million per year.
Sorensen, an ex-minister Midwest Airlines, recently flyed by Spirit, and was interesting that he would find out the flight out when passengers were packed with an uncomfortable Spirit assembly.
“A flight plan was the most gorgeous of what I saw for my carriage in the aircraft,” he said.
I've been waiting to see the dentist and the dragon in the shipping.
Samolet was a pool, and he said, “and the floor was hardly passed. ”
The frontier should also be paid for the $2 for the coffee, the tea, the gas or the sock.
Frontier said that passengers receiving gas or sock may leave the whole bank and that the amount of coffee would be provided free.
She'll still be free of water.
The US Airways had long tried to take the drink payment in 2008, but it was rejected by seven months after passengers began to complain and no other large aircraft had followed her example.
Frontier's initiative on payment for a handle when passengers do not buy tickets directly to the aircraft, it is her last measure to administer customers on their website.
Aia company pays online sales tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each sale ticket.
This helped all aircrafts to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly in their own place, not to go to the tourist online agency.
However, Frontier continued all in this area.
In September, she began to give twice less than a bonus miles to a flight passenger who purchased tickets through the online tourism agency.
In the midst, it was 25 per cent of the trip.
Yeah, a trip a 1000 miles from Frontier, acquired in the online tourism agency, would be allowed to get 250 miles away.
Furthermore, passengers may be selected if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has the base of faithful customers in her family town in Denver, but its business is decreased and lost.
The expenditure was decreased to 9 per cent, and the summer opportunities were almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published in the Middle Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to correct the financing of Frontier in the sector of the sale of aviation.
ANB is injury to the internal error, not the hackers in the end of the website
The Occupied Secret Agency of National Security stated on Thursday night that the end of their website was cutting a few hours of technical difficulty, not the hackers, as the network stated.
“NSA.gov was not incompatible during a few hours tonight because of the internal error that occurred during the planning update” reported the informing agency in an official electronic letter.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Declaration that the transmission of the work has been issued as a distributed type of “service” attack [DDOS] is invalid.
Last night, the server monitoring system registered that the ANB site had not worked at least six hours, and the website is still not available for some users.
The previous representative of ANB reported ABC News that the internal secret network of the non-related Agency was disrupted.
No secret information is in danger, reported by the representative.
At least one online hacker-active group stated that it was responsible for the conclusion of the ANB site using DDOS attacks.
DDOS attacks are developed so that the target website is closed until the servers are not reloaded and the site is not out of the building.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to detect the internal system.
The previous super-secretary ANB, which was ever received by the “No Agency”, had been in the centre of public attention and a bad critical after the reports on its broad programs in the land, all this reaction to secret files slaughtered from the office and published by the former Edward Snowden.
The growing field around the Agency pointed out that today the incident was the result of hacker targeted action.
Bombardier's profit is decreased with the fall and number of aircraft orders
Bombardier, Canadian flight manufacturer and train company, reported on the reducing of income of 15 per cent under the reduced number of orders and aircraft delivery in the third quarry and contractual problems in its liquid unit.
The Bombardier company also has not published any data on the annual tests of its new CSeries flight and provided new information on whether aviation plans would be implemented in the commercial exploitation of its new CSeries, September.
After the first flight of an experienced aircraft that was about half months ago, he flyed only three times that caused questions about whether a graphic test stage is.
The results did not justify forecasts and brought actions to fall by more than 8 per cent to the Toronto Fund.
Cameron Doerxen, an analysis of the National Financial Bank, slowed its evaluation from the “Mediterranean” to the “medior market” because of the conviction that the growth of actions is limited to the nearest quarter or two.
“The decrease of aircraft delivery was generally predicted, we are, of course, disappointed by transportation indicators,” said Doerxen in the review of the fund market.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders to CSeries on the continuation of the annual test programme.
However, if the new orders are not announced in the next months, we suggest that the market will be more skeptically addressed to the programme.
Bombardier's company hopes that the family of CSeries flights allows her to sell place in the lower price segment of the market where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first experienced aircraft model was presented in March and first flight in September after a few months of delay.
However, firm orders for CSeries are not too much until 177, as potential purchasers are expected to check the adoption of the brand-efficiency company and the potential economicity of the new ray.
There are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
The Chief Executive Director, Peter Boduan, was convinced that Bombardier would reach its goal at 300 fixed orders at the time that the first flight was launched in the commercial exploitation.
In the fourth meeting, the leaders also assured analyticals and media that the programme was forwarded to the plan.
“ The tenth flight model was no longer on the ground than was expected,” said Bodohan during the telephone conference, adding that a simple aircraft was planned for air tests and program updates.
All producers are planning to test differently.
We decided to take the first flight and break up the update, so we did.
This will happen throughout the annual test programme.
The second of the five tests must make a flight in the nearest weeks, and all the other will soon follow it as the company reported.
However, skeptical analysis relate to the declaration that the first customer can begin to exploitation of CSeries flights within 12 months after his first fleet.
The Bombardier company stated that it would evaluate the period of exploitation and provide new information within the next few months.
“ This is the late time of years tests, all of the visibility, and corresponds to the internal Bombardier graph, - supports our point of view that the entry into the exploitation will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerxen.
In the third quarter, on 30 September, the purity of Bombardier ' s income reduced to $147 million or $8,172 million, or 9 percent for action in the past year.
The corrected income for action remained at 9 targets.
The total income was decreased, from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analytics were expected to reach $4.56 billion and $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth world’s aircraft manufacturer reported that he had set 45 aircrafts for quarters that less than in the previous year - 57.
The total number of orders falled from 83 to 26 flights.
The port of the Airspace Division orders was $32.9 billion for September 30, not changed since 31 December.
“In the aviational field, the results agreed to our goals, but few market conditions became unpleasant,” said Boduan.
The voluntary income in the airspace was 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest travel producer in the world, reported that the currency income in this sector was almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The portal of orders in the transport unit was $32.6 billion for September 30, which was a little above the indicator of 31 December.
In the revenue of the transport unit, there were negative problems with a number of major contracts.
The Directorate stated that the fourth Quartal would submit a new development plan.
Bombardier company, who also declared that the main financial director of Google Patrick Pittat will enter the Directors' Board, was 8.5 per cent to $4.83 in the mid-fourth market.
The Brazilian Emmbraer SA company, a third world-wide commercial manufacturer and Bombardier’s nearby competitor, reported on the reducing of quarrel income on 10 per cent.
Sony calculates the lowest annual income
The Japanese electronic producer, Sony, has finished the last quarter of the clean loss of $19.3 billion, or $197 million, reduced the prediction of arrival for the current financial year.
Sony results from July to September 2013 were more enhanced than expected to have fallen television, videocameras and personal computers of the Japanese company.
Sony’s Television business in the II quarter of the first three-year operational income of 5,2 billion yen, again in the reporting period slowed up to 9,3 billion of operational loss.
The Japanese consumer electricity market suffers difficult times, especially due to a reduction in television demand.
While competitors try to find out of a complex situation, Sony continues to concentrate on the consumer segment.
For example, one of the main partners of Sony, Panasonic, has recently increased focuss on industrial complexs: the sales of the company will grow by high levels, especially through car systems and environmentally clean technologies.
As a result of the end of the financial year, which will be concluded in March 2014, Sony has obtained 179 billion an operational arrival against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
According to the Thomson Reuters Agency, analysis suggested that the data would be significantly above and up to 221 billion.

Hen has been the stimulator of the symptoms education
Scientists from the University of John Hopkins and the Medical School of Maunt-Sinae have found whites, through which Foxp2 works, stimulating the education of new relationships between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and you can read its short contents on the website.
Hen Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly linked to the speaking.
Its role was made in 2001 through the discovery of a few people who had not been able to make the words correct and sometimes have not been understood.
Scientists found that the work of the family Foxp2 was violated, but how he performed its function was still unknown.
In the new study, biology showed that at least part of their Foxp2 functions were the stimulator of new symptoms in the brain-related forming.
It performs this by another gene, SRPX2.
The past has been discovered by searching factors that encourage symptoms education.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, which only involves Foxp2.
What SRPX2 really affects vaccination, scientists have confirmed the test on museums.
When the genital activity was artically decreased, they were less cried at the separation of the mother.
If gene activity was restored, restored, and the frequency of the sounds published.
Previous links were shown on the mouse also to the invasion of Foxp2.
Lifes introduced human copy of the genes have eating actively and lower than normal museums.
However, scientists do not know whether Foxp2's work is related and, respectively, managed by SRPX2 with the "mechanical" properties of sound education or more accurate processes.
The lawyer with cocaine dependence, who assigned the head of a police investigation group, is in prison
The 42-year-old Basharat Kitta provided information on the criminal authority of Nila Scarboro
The lawyer was afraid that his secret dependance would be discovered
It was sentenced to three years of prison by the Royal Court of Liberia.
The prestigious lawyer, who told the drugs about the big police investigation, was in prison for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat child transmitted the criminal authority of Nila Scarboro secret information on his investigation of the illegal drug trafficking activities after threatening the cocaine dependence.
A lawyer who received the call of Bush and a criminal named “the great lawyer” was arrested in his home in 2011 after the police surrounding Scarboro, which he had previously represented in the court related to drugs.
The officers noted that the 32-year-old Scarboro left three packages with cocaine at the lawyer house in Bleekberg Lankashi, as long as he was at the dinner association of lawyers with colleagues.
As a result, the child “regulated” drugs of class A, after testing showed the follow-up of cocaine in his hair, on his paper and on credit cards.
In the course of the eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information on arrests of two persons on Scarboro, as well as one of his reporters.
All four suspected were at that time under the supervision of the police under the extensive investigation of the criminal organization for heroin and cocaine in Lankashire, Cambry, Mercyway, Berlin and West New Yorkshire.
They were still 32 persons later in prison after the police had issued a series of heroin raids and cocaine for $1.5 million and more than 200 million.
A 42-year-old child transmitted information to criminals because of the fear that his cocaine dependence would be opened.
Today, in the Real Court of Liberia, the Chief, who works in the legal company of Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, has been struggled after the recognition of his responsibilities in two cases of preventing the judicial implementation of the trial court in the Liberal Court.
He acknowledged cocaine at one of the previous judicial meetings.
The judicial division occurred after the police, which investigated Scarboro, explained that he had regularly spoken with the child on the phone from February 2011.
Two detectives were investigated and found how he went to the Kid's house in Blakeberg and placed drugs of 60 per cent cleaning in a black golf for a golf under the smooth judiciary.
Shortly after the Scarboro transfer, it was often contacted with the child, who was at the dinner at the football station, Jude Park team Blackbern Robers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations were among them.
The court learned that the child had “regularly used” cocaine after the tests were found in his hair, cake and credit cards.
The child was later arrested, but he refused the use of cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected diplom because he was his customer and insisted that their association was a “advocate secret”.
During his detention, he took his paper and tried to get a few credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and he also had a hair picture.
At the police survey, he said he had a home office, and customers came home to him for legal affairs.
However, the court was known that after the important arrests, he called the largest parties to the illicit trafficking of drugs, some of whom he previously represented in the court to tell them that there were detectives.
Ann Wright said, “If anyone knows that it should not violate the law, it is a lawyer for criminal affairs.”
Mr. Batteth is accused of abuse by his lawyer on criminal affairs because he has undertaken too close relationship with certain customers.
The contact we're talking about isn't just a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker who enjoys the drugs of his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations are obviously lawful because he was a lawyer.
However, this has been significantly overlooked by the general relations of the lawyer and the customer.
He prevented the police investigation as strong as possible to allow those to continue their criminal activity.
Mr. Dadt wasn't shocking her professional, but shocked her.
He was too close to some customers, in particular Scarboro, and allowed it to consciouse in his ininterestation.
The child did not admit the guilt and said, “If I would have been corrupted by a lawyer I am, and I would like to give information to Mr. Scarboro, I wouldn't wait for 15 hours, I would do so immediately.”
But after the meeting, the senior officer Lee Holstead from the Lankashira police said: “Mr. Child has become a criminal lawyer in criminal crime, just as he began to get drugs into organized crime representatives.”
His attraction to cocaine was unreasonable and vulnerable for the purposes of the main criminal group parties who were able to get valuable information on the police investigations.
The lawyers should follow the higher standards of professional ethics and enhance the confidence and confidence of society.
Mr. Bateth has given this confidence and tried to shut up his professionals.
Survey on the case, Mr. Chief, was the Lankashir Unit of a particularly dangerous organized crime, which has already been sentenced on three cases of cocaine conservation, and now on the prevention of justice, demonstrating our efforts to obtain a fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case be warned for criminals that no one is outside the fulfilment of the law.
We'll find you and join you to the court.
Scarboro himself was sentenced for 14 years after the recognition of his guilt in order to provide heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
More 35 persons in maquination were sentenced to 153 years of drug crime.
On his website, the child organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers in which he said that his dream work is a lawyer who represents the death condemnation in America, a perfect company for his dinner — Mohammed Ali, and the motivation in the work is inequality.

Italian workers with a stage are on the road of young people
Italy's unemployed people's recursions.

In Moscow, the construction of the TSOs will lead to
With each year, the capital authorities have promised to restructur more transportation (TPIs).
It is planned to introduce 255 MTs until 2020.
What the project is being designed is our correspondent.
A few months ago, there was a constructive board in the Smolenian metro.
The letter said it was the installation of a transportation chain.
It was very strange because there was no land transport to the Smolenian side and there is no movement on it.
In order to reach the nearest tropical stop on the Saddle corner, it is necessary to overcome 130 meters, including the land transit through the Carmanica Travel.
Now the Smolenian is almost all finished.
A color lare, demonstrated for a newspaper, and the asfalt changed the brown before the entry.
That's the whole vehicle.
Transport and transport skys are slightly and capitalized, and they explain in the press service of the Central Transport Department.
Capital SMEs haven't been.
The park building, trade objects, passenger movement, small architectural forms and well-being.
In general, none of the transporters have been employed, but professional budgets from the Capital Restructuring Department of Moscow.
Transport strike is not necessarily complicated construction, explains the Director of the Economic Institute of Transport and Transport Policy of Mihail Blinkin's High Economic School.
Sometimes it is enough to shut over the head and the cards that report the time of the transport.
This is, for example, the Metro of Jenevo recently opened a fully valuable slope of a swimming area.
Don't be weighed, but with swimming parks and maps that indicate when the bus comes.
But in the flight of the number of officials, all of them have been recorded in the TSO.
In 2011, Mary planned to build all 151 stones, with 59 capital buildings.
The plans are now up to 2020 up to 255 MTS.
Of them, half of them are promised to put up this year again.
Although there is a TSO development programme in the city, no quality criteria is referred to, Alexander Moroso, co-chairman of the World and Transport Organization.
The number of objects are counted, but the quality of the shipment is often worried.
The criteria of the expert should be two: first is a reduction in the time of transfer, secondly a goodness.
Before the possibility to change the type of transport, not out of rain.
In Moscow it is sometimes a serious restraint.
A clear example of the VDNH metro.
The previous reserve buses with the Yaroslavian Shoss arrived in the circle before the main entry to the UNHCR.
Their stops have now been moved to the opposite side of Yaroslava on the street of Cosmonat.
More than a metro, a significantly further than the monarch, closer to the living houses.
Because the people did not completely want to swallow under the windows and to shoot all possible instances.
In Moscow, Capital SMEs weren't undertaken immediately.
The first one of them began to build five years ago in the Metro Planner.
The draft was intended to be a scripture.
And it was really received as the transfer of the strike to the investors was converted into the bath trade center.
No, there's snakes for buses, sweet so that you don't go from the rainy, and three stages of the car.
Indeed, the chemical trolley No.202 and No.203 in Moscow SAT did not in principle.
They were abroad away from the metro.
There's been more trading places.
Only one of the 32 shops, and there is almost everything from the zoometers to the bus.
Really, who of the passengers need to buy a new car on the road?
We've got a capital ATs, why it's always being obtained in the commercial center.
The situation recently reached its logical conclusion when part of the automobilists decided to make a market.
Now, the third stage of the "Planer" TIR is among the parking fields in the park.
Protection, speech, Chinese jinns, non-Russian speakers, and guards, who are badly viewing our photo.
The strike was finally transformed into the basement.
It's what the Metro Planner had a market, but they took it.
And in the prefecture of the traders, they were shocked and landed on a swimming park.
There's always empty because of high prices.
It's the most funny thing that the market was shocked for building its place... a new swimming aircraft.
That's a year.
At the Metro Caluja, the approach from the metro to the bus was 50 meters away, says Alexander Moross.
After the construction of the Trade Center, such as TPIs, the distance increased up to 170 meters.
In order to bus, we need to walk through the whole trade center.
After 22 hours when he closed, it must be walked under an open heaven.
Otherwise, buildings on "Planer" and "Calls" will quickly be shown by flowers.
In the midst of September, the Mare Commission adopted planning decisions for the first eight capital SMEs.
Four of them will be 25, not considered by two-third subterraneans.
The main monster will grow to the Tushino metro, 418.7.000 cubits of the surface.
Representatives of the RJD hydrocarbon vacuums, which are responsible for the construction of TSOs in metro, have already reported to journalists: in future shops, guests and apartments are equipped with shops, guests and apartments.
The officials believe that multi-agency parks take up from third to half of the surface.
Let's take an example of the "national" garage.
As a result, the shop of 258 cars recently built on the International Street has a range of 8015 meters.
This means, for the parking, 2,6,000 cars in the Petrosco-Razzomic, you need 80,000 squares.
It's less than third of the machine that they're going to build there.
Let the two stages go to every bus perron.
It remains at least 1500,000 kilometers of commercial impairment.
And this is almost two GM.
If the swallowing swallowing swallows in stations and swallows, the other areas will be swallowed by metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many " functional items" including guests, offices and even sports.
The department of Moscow’s property has recently conducted journalists that develop a draft decision which allows investors to obtain a share in the TSOs directly.
Without any competition.
Because prayers for the city's transport questions are priority.
The perfect tv is, for example, the Harvard Station in Boston or Scene in Toronto, surely Alexander Moross.
There are trolley and traumas under the ground at the metro level and the distance of the approach from the vagon meter to the tram is only 50 meters away from the road.
There is no limited trade around.
But the Moscow officials are extreme.
Or we will not build anything, or by 25 stages with offices and apartments.
Esther proposes to compare to the extremism of the distress of the patriotic feelings
In order to protect the legitimate patriotic feelings of citizens against Russia's prosecution and distortions, the Honour of Russia proposes to compare the distortion of the patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to punish for the five years of prison.
As reported by the Ezware newspaper, such amendments in legislation prepared by the Olympic Energy Committee are already aimed at receiving a sentence to the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under the patriotic feelings of the citizens of the amendment, the amendment proposes to understand the emotional relationship with a country whose citizen is characterized by the love of this country, responsible for its court, respect for his history and culture.
As Mihew indicates, there are sanctions for abuse against formal signs of the State authority, flag and herb.
For this reason, Parliament's view of the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be deceived and distorted by state symbols, and other manifestations of infringeness to our country, are inadequate in Russian law.
As an example, he brings the devastating annually in the Canon of the Day of Discussion when some medical persons are able to make themselves aware of the heroic support of the U.S.S. people in combating fascists.
The born main-general celebration, the Summit Day, on May 9, is the real vaccine annually developed.
Involvement in the university and the "alternative view" in history, some publishers are discussed that, as unfortunately, the cultural Germans have not been acquired by the Soviet Union!
I read that absolutely invalid in the country where the pride of history remains the main "power" nation, Oлег Miheev says.
Furthermore, Mihewa said that the patrioticly established people in Russia is much more than religious, but the law calls for the distortion of the feelings of believers and the elimination of the patriotic feelings can be almost unnecessary.
According to the people ' s election, it is necessary to compare the distortion of the patriotic feelings of extremist activity and to the article 282 of the Criminal Code for the Punishment.
The draft law provides punishment for the distortion of the patriotic feelings: from the 100-month trap to the 5-year-old prison.

Safety Peace in Mozambique is a result of the conflict of influential people
Under this statue, Samory Mashela, Mozambique-building President, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to scann the world on one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want to return peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Suza, Executive Director of Investment Company.
In fear of the future of her country, she changed the business cost to a football descriptive “We require security” in Portugal, and joined to the Tower of Independence on Thursday.
During two weeks, practical daily communications were made between the government troops and Renamo, one of the most cruelly strikes since the death of more than 20 years ago.
Renamos was ever known for a reestablishment supported by the white authorities of Rodesia and then by the Government of South Africa for the efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the death of 1992, it became a opposition party.
Analytics believe that the country is not re-interrupted to the full-scale conflict, but recent events have been struggling foreign investors and local people.
The high rates for the rapid growth of the economy, since the opening of huge gases and western western western western western western, more than $50 billion, as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarco from the United States.
The right party of Frilem, the political force leader since 1975, and the Renamo Party accused one another in the established tension.
The Renamo Party argued that the Government was a shutch of the last clamps, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, traditional Renamo, October 17.
The Financial Times Fernando Mazang, representative of Renamo, reported the Financial Times Fernando Mazang, government attacked the bases of Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakamu, a group leader.
The Government accusates Renamo in the initiative of counterparts, accusing the party to attack soldiers.
The President of Armanda Gabus tried to develop fears of instability.
He declared AFP, the French Information Agency, in the medieval that Mr. Dhlakama felt “unfailer” who wanted to use “all that remained from his power to try to prove that he could put up his own decisions to the Government”.
Frelimo and Renamo are opposing that they want to avoid war.
However, fears increased after reporting that Mazanga declared that Renamo was rejected by the peace agreement in 1992.
He reported to Financial Times that it was not to be observed by the Freemo Party Agreement.
“ Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all the seriousness, ” said Mazanga.
The previous negotiations between the parties have not been made to delay the tensions that have increased the series of pillars in this year.
“ These are two influentious persons (Gebuza and Dhlakama), cut into legs, ” said Joseph Hanlon, professor of the University of Open and expert on Mozambique.
No one is a good negotiator and no one is ready to go to the necessary departure.
The Renamo Party, who is trying to achieve election reforms, has already stated that it would be bound by the municipal elections designated for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for the next year.
Some comments interpreted this pressure as a slow movement attempt to achieve disbursements and financial funds from the Government.
The portion of votes for Renamo is decreased since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is based on the former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its indicators in these elections.
Mr. Mazang said that Mr. Gaboz, who has to leave from the next year when the end of his second term, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn't want a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, no peace, because he doesn't want to leave the president” said Mazanga.
The possibilities of Renamo, however, have already undertaken destructive and voluntary attacks against the police offices and cars on a key driver from the north to the south.
Most of the shocks were in Sofala province, which is hundreds of miles north of Maputo, but includes Bairah — a port that was the hill company, including Rio Tinto and Vale, to export an edge.
In June, Rio stopped the use of iron roads for about a week after Renamo threatened the attack on the iron road.
Mazang was adorned when he asked whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo party wanted to “advertise the international community that the cases in Mozambique are not very good,” said Mazanga.
The instability has increased by the Government, and many also concerns corruption, short-term development and recent defects, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent medical company of Mediacoop.
“Their people believe that the responsibility for the future country is to be made by the Government and the President who must find out these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuan, a demonstration participant, said that people just want stability.
“There are no concern of Renamo or Frilymo, they just want to renew peace, they want free access to roads,” he said.

Saying that many mifs are a “scandale, too skandal and in some cases too unacceptable for education in schools”, Crossly-Holland speaks for the "total selection" of text age.
“I think it is wonderful that in America the mif and the folkler are already part of education,” he said.
I spoke for introducing them in the training programme for twenty years.
He added that “extreme morality” authors and providers “estimated interest” in children, and the main ideas were“transmised” in the attractive history.
Crossley-Holland, which translated Beevulf with English and Saxonian language, also wrote the Norwegian Mises College for the publications of Penuin and the British People's Words, said: “You may, of course, have an intention, but you better keep them with you.”
The great difference between the adult author written for adults and the adult author written for children may be the need to feel a certain hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or bring to a happy end, but it is necessary that a national understanding of good and evil.
And this must be subsequent; opened through history, not clearly formatted.
Old principle: Show, not telling.

In Siberia, it should not be a vegan: the warm point does not replace the spouse
Why the vegetation does not go for life in Siberia, explaining the R.A. News Correspondent.
People who are fully rejected from animal origin should not live in Siberia.
There they do not take winter without loss for health, and no warm measuring potters do not compensate them, are considered the requested Weekend Day of New Siria dioxics and doctors.
Get Little Oil
Strange vegetation, not only from meat and fish, but also from milk, meat and ice, becomes a modest life.
However, the physicians are convinced that in New Sibirk and other towns of Siberia, there is no need for health.
Full dismissment of animals is harmful.
The animals contain unlimited minosules, which are very difficult to compensate plants.
It's necessary to be included in a ration even if milk or egg is a certain diologo of Marina God.
It provides for example a fish containing a small oxygen of Omega-3.
The most richest of them is lunar oil.
"What to need it in the numbers necessary for humans, you need litras to drink!" says diethologist.
Medicines are convinced that the people of Siberia have to be a particular attention to the ratio to winter.
In this season, the vegetation is particularly doubtful.
In the conditions of our reality, high demands for food are made.
In order to not exceed, there is a higher calibracy need.
"If humans limit themselves on animal products, therefore, it is unlikely," said the specialist.
The doctor Olga Pognok's physician.
She adds that the fruits and fruits are not out.
Humans are better feeding products which are produced in the residence region or where they were born.
The genetic code is designed to improve and reverse these products.
And the winter people do not want to shoot a shooter, but a shooter or something else,” explains the doctor's position.
In its words, that weagans may actually benefit from different skins, craps, bombs, local fruits, balls that remain in the winter of nuclears.
However, this is not enough for full food.
According to Claudi Arifulina, the cybers in organisms are sufficient from the middle of August in the middle of September.
The full flow of vegetation in our heavy natural conditions, when temperatures can be changed by 30 °C and snow in May, is not celestial.
The body for life needs energy, and it is primarily grain," constitutes medicine.
The doctors noted that the pregnancy is particularly dangerous for children and pregnants.
Childs grow, they need construction material, including aminoxistus.
We will give them unworthy by maintaining vegetarianity.
Temporary needs also to increase the content of white, vitamins and micro-elements in the menu.
"They are unconscious of them," is sure of God.
Arifulina says that adult man will choose everything he wants to play in the games that he wants.
He has already formed organs, skelets, organs.
However, children must be fully demanded.
If parents lost him any micro-electrics or aminoxistics, chooseing for him what he is, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"The inadequacy of these or other substances for the development of the brain, the view, the bones are no longer rebuilding tomorrow," says it.
All requested medicators are in the view of an insufficient winter as heat and carriage fruit and fruit.
What we have and produced in heat contains less than the necessary microelements that we need to do in the open floor.
"The quantity of products isn't there," God says.
Ariphulin also notes that the customs and warm fruits and fruits are far from perfect standards.
The desire of producers to gather larger wealth causes the damage of quality.
"I blocks are not rooted on the line, the shooting swimming and slaughtered, the powders are sweet and swallowed, ", adds examples of medical care, and adds that they may be shocked by a limited number of acceptances.
And they become not vitamins, but cells.
This does not depend on the laboratory of the Siberian Physical and Technology Institute of Agrarian Problems, the agriculture candidate Vera Peterk.
She says that, in the right approach and compliance with all the standards and conditions of warming, it could be possible to increase the full value of fruit.
If they are trying to escape more than a square metro, it will, of course, become more and more strike to raise mineral grains.
For example, when too many azotic additives grow rapidly, they are large, but driving and dishearted," she explains, adding that quality matter, at first, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.

The Cities appeal debate should be held after 14 March 2014.
The tactics to stop and find a number of lawyers on civil rights were criticized.
The “on-the-scale” has been practitioned in a few decades in a form, but the number of documented stops have been significantly increased in the administration of the independent Mr. Michael Blumberg, reached the absolute recursion in 2011 in 684 330 people, most of which black and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four persons, all representatives of the national minorities, were collective for the court.
Amendments in the programme " stop and search" at the police Department of New York states that these changes will end the unexpected practice, form a more reliable and effective police service, and that other police departments can influence this practice.
Opponents argued that the changes of the fighting spirit of police, not the criminality level, will lead to the unnecessary costs of money and do not address a more global complicated problem in the police due to the reduction of the number of officials in the past few thousands of years.
The judge noted that it was not stopping the practice of stopping and searching, which corresponds to the Constitution, but changes the way the New York police stops people.
The third gallery has opened a trace zone
In Moscow there was a new trace zone.
It is located in the third gallery area and operates two miles (2 km) from the New York City Station to the Boloth Area.
For all years, we have established strikes, flowers, boxes, urnes and toilets, deep burns and illicit advertising.
Besides the Climate and Lawricia Trails, which were already swimming, five streets closed - the Ordenic Tup, the Great and Small Tolmache, the Cadachu Beach and the Boloth area.
The movement of Mauritania and Peter’s road movement is not limited.
In the Fifty-Found Street area of the New Coast Station, the Climate Railway Conditions have been established without removing the movement and retirement of the past parts, transmitting newsmsk.com.
The third gallery, the priest of the clergy of the Pope, the museums, the libraries, the memorys and other attractions was found inside the peak area.
Previously, the Tuberculous Passage, the Peninsula and the Kuzekimp mountains were completely shocked.
The Great Distrik, where a swimming zone was opened at the beginning of September, was decided to close the car for weekly and feasts.
Coulson went to the phone to check the confidential message.
The former editor of newspapers of the World Andy Coldson suggested that he uses “the phone, the phone and the resistance” when trying to confirm the false information about the Roman Charles Clarke, who was at the time of the Minister of Internal Affairs.
The accused, the Queen Advocate Andre Edis reported the Court of Old-Bay that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World had received an uncertain news that Clark met his “Accessful Advisor” Hanna Polby.
The newspaper ordered a private detective Glenn Mullkeyr to cut Paulby's voice mail and guarded her home to take an interview, but he also called her and left the voice message, and he heard the court.
“The appointment is that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a man who will stand around any house, hoped to spend somebody, he who likes to propose the story of people to see what they will say, ” said Mr. Edis.
He said that the newspapers of the World used three ways to investigate the story: phones, phones, trails and contradiction.
The editor is personally engaged in the third.
Obviously he knows the second, the second, he must just.
What about the first?
Does he know what the phones are broken?
He said, "No, we say, oh, oh!
Roman Clark's ears first highlighted the editions of News of the World when the source, who was sexually interested by Mrs. Paul, said: “No time, she and Charles.”
A vote record received at least three times from her phone was issued from the Mulkeir house in August 2006.
The following also found notes on a private detection computer where Miss Polby and her sister were fixed as Projects.
During the period, when she was under the side, grandmother and grandmother, Mrs. Paulby received anonymous calls on requests to provide information on her, Mr. Edis said.
At that time, the former main reporter Neville Turlbeck and the former reporter James Waserap were controlled by Mrs. Polby's movement.
On 18 June 2005, he said: “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and that I would like to very much to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Edis said that the participation of Coulson in this story was the same scenario as with other influential people, such as the former Minister of Internal Affairs David Blankett.
The judges heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered a conflict with Mr. Blankett on a marriage with a woman while he himself met the corresponding Rebecca Brux, who was at the time of the marriage.
Coulson and Brux refused to enter into conspiration with others with a view to the shutting of phones for the period from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulkeyr, Turlbeck and Weatherap were recognized in the phone shooting.
Snowden claims that he is willing to report to the FAO authorities on the case of hearing
Advocate Edward Snowden expresses the willingness to arrive in Germany only when it appears to the legal opportunity, and meets the representatives of the FGR authorities, RI News.

The United States reduces food for the poor
Food rates for the family of four persons are reduced to $36 per month
From Friday in the United States, the financial guarantee of products known as "Fudstamps" is reduced as the operation of the relevant State programme is completed.
The family of four persons will now be allocated to $36 per month less than previously.
This is about 47 million Americans.
On the information of the Reater Agency, in 2012, the financial assistance for one person was a medium of $133 per month.
The food assistance costs in the United States increased up to $80 billion per year because of the growth of unemployed and the food prices.
About 14 per cent of the Americans are trusted in free food assistance issued by Foudstempam, containing such a name in previous times when they had the form of paper cupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicns in the Congress require further reductions in the programme, claiming that it should be aimed at helping those who need more.
Food shops around America are concerned that the reduction of consumer costs would be reduced.
The United States Congress continue to discuss how to reduce the financing of governments.
Blizzard has freely issued a 19-year-old platform
The Blizzard study has freely issued its Blackhorne platform on the PC in 1994.
This reports WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game was available at Battle.net in the Blizzard classic game section.
However, some hymers noted that it is currently possible for only the users whose accounts relate to the US Servizial part.
For Russian users, games are not available.
Like media, Blizzard's version now released on PC does not vary from the original game option.
Saundreck to Blackthorne was also unlikely.
The Blackthorne Platformer, who Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally came to the SNES console.
His events were disappeared on the Tuul planet, whose people were separated by the dark and light kings.
One day, the Dark Goal of Sarac decided to kill the light king of Vulros and become a single ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlarus Kyle, who saved from death and sent to the earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight with the Saratians and to protect the people of the planet.
The original Blackhorne was the first game that the study issued after its name to Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that she was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne's publisher was Interplay's company.
New automates appear in the Moscow Metropolitan.
But to sell passenger tickets, they're not for money, but for meetings.
One trip of the 30th rule is a potential passenger at 30 meetings.
The number of meetings will be recorded by the special device using modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first device will be established on the "Original" station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of new bicycle sports, President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexandre Jacques and Olympic gympics, Alex Nemom and Elena Zamrochica, will receive President.
Recognition of the National Security Agency increases the paraoid corporations in respect of the public trading
The day at the end of August, the German police was low on the U.S. console in Francoforte, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Federal Constitution Protection Service (BfV), the internal investigation services of Germany, his task was to photograph the building box of the United States representatives, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Buchensban.
German media said that BfV had hoped to find the anciens of listening devices, and these actions were involved in negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clepper, Director of the United States National Intelligence, reaffirmed, in September, that the United States did not use external information for “in order to defeat the trade secrets of foreign companies in the interests of the United States to enhance their international competitiveness or to increase their gain”.
But since Edward Snowden, a contract officer, began to publish his credible secrets of the United States, the European Governments and the leaders of the company, are no longer sure if you can believe the director.
It was reported that the United States National Security Agency was monitored by the Brazilian Oil company Petrobras and received access to the data scheduled by U.S. district service providers, including Google and Yahoo, to new higher levels.
The last chapter was reported that the phone of the Office of Angela Mercelle may have been heard for about ten years.
If the most influential person of Europe can be a museum, there is, of course, potential channels are also the leaders of business.
Snowden made a clearly intensive cooperation between the United States Intelligence Services and the Companions.
I think that these data are probably used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Green, President of the BITMI Joint, representing the small and medium-sized IT company.
German companies are convinced that the United States now represents almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial specimens and the cutting of data, according to the study published in July by the EC Consulting Agency.
However, in all documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, the United States has not yet proved that the trade secrets of foreign companies were transferred to their own companies.
Politicals expressed concern that the EU had no need for certain information technologies and the Internet, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence from the United States.
Budgets are skeptically related to this.
Someone in the German Parliament says that we need to create a German Google.
I can just close the eyes and slowly open them again...
“ This is not the option,” says Gasso Plattner, President of the German programme provider for SAP business.
If there is a strong European IT industry need, it was not necessary to allow it to die over 20 years.
All are subsidied in Germany: carbon from cars to farmers.
All except the IT industry.
However, the scope and technical development of the U.S. Spionage Agencys, which were known by Snowden’s declarations, were shocked for some companies who previously thought that China was the largest risk.
The greatest use is in areas technologies where European companies have better recognized that the data scheduled in the United States are in the same jurisprudence and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to the investigation carried out by the Cloud Security Association, some 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use the services of the district conductor in the United States after the shipping of the American intellectual analysis of Prism.
Jim Sneeb, one of the SAP executive directors, said: "We see that the consumers take a new question that has not occurred a year ago, namely: where my data are stored and if you can ensure that they are physically staying in this law."
Many German leaders say that the last communication is only a confirmation that they have already known: the powerful States want to steal their most precious secrets, and therefore the data should be protected by any value.
What happens to an economic spionage is unexpectedly.
He always had a place.
“ This was the subject of the discussion of many years and has not been significantly changed in the current field, ” says Kurt Block, head of the BASF Chemistry Director.
Americans are spy for us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spy for them, because this is in our national interests to protect our commercial business.
Corporation leaders usually do not like to respect the subjects of the responsible measures they have taken, as it could provide the advantage of the opposer.
In major companies, there has been a long time the idea of taking a free shipping ship or leaveing a taxi without view in the hotel number, at least unrespectably.
Urrich Hackenberg, a member of the Director of the Audi Automobile Company, said that this standard practice has been to collect mobile phones before the government meetings so that they could not be used as a listening device for many years.
The Federal Protection Service of Germany recommends that the company leaders consider the use of simple mobile phones during the shipping trips because of the vulnerability of phones.
Subsequently, the mobile phones are elected.
However, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable for explosions and trails.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders of the world market in their specific lower.
“The small and medium-sized enterprises often have no experience, staff and financial resources to protect effectively the corporate secrets from an unnecessary access” warns BfV.
The United States warn their own economic spy companies from other countries.
The United States National Intelligence Independent in February, France, together with Russia and Israel, was in the second series of offenders who are chairing for economic intelligence after China, argued The Washington Post.
The member of the Board of Directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it was talking about the economic spionship, “Francis is worse to all”.
Bernard Scarsiny, an ex-director of the French Internal Intelligence Agency, reported in DCRI in the last month, said: “The services are well known that all countries, even when they cooperate in combating terrorism, are shocked for their unions.”
Mothers of a boyfriend from Georgia who died in “unfortunate case” believe that their son was killed
Mothers of Georgia, whose body was found in the sporting mood in the second school room, believe that their son was killed, claimed the lawyers of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January, in a vertical standing mother, who was left to the courts in the sport room of his second school.
The following sheriffs around Loundez concluded that Johnson died in tragic cases, but the family of 17-year-old adolescent adolescence is hindered.
“ They are absolutely sure that their sons were killed, ” said FoxNews.com Benjamin Cramp, lawyer who represents Kennet and Jaclin Johnson.
They never believed he died as sheriff says.
“ They believe that this is contrary to logic, physical laws, and well-being,” said Kramp.
They think it's a hidden for the protection of humans or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“ They sent her son to school with a school bag, and they returned to the body, ” he said.
The American lawyer Michael Mur said on Thursday that he had conducted a official investigation of Johnson's death, noted that a number of key issues remained without answer.
What was the cause of death?
Has his death been the result of a crime?
Mur made a statement on the press conference on Thursday.
I'll study all the facts wherever they're brought.
My goal is to know the truth.
“I hold the view that there are sufficient grounds for official investigation,” he said.
Mur told the reporters that the primary hiding showed that Johnson died as a result of the “position asylum”.
However, the second hidden, according to Mura, showed another cause of death.
“ There are some questions that should be authorised or detailed,” he said.
Mur added that if he finds sufficient authority to require a criminal or civilian investigation of Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Chief Circle Loundez was not available for comments when it was requested on Thursday.
The Court of South Georgia in the midst requested the authorities to publish all video records of monitoring cameras that were monitored by the investigators.
Youth parents said they hope that video records have a key to think about how he died.

Diseases control and prevention centres have made recommendations for schools relating to allergic children
The list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in schools has been published in the centres of control and prevention of diseases.
This is the first list of recommendations made by the United States Government, while the number of children of school age suffering from food alergias grows.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
The monitoring and prevention centres found that the spread of food allergy among children has increased from 1997 to 2007 by 18 per cent.
The Directorate-General provides information on schools how to improve the knowledge of the providers and providers of the food alergetic in children and how to assist in allergy reactions.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline stocks — mostly for injections are used by EpiPen’s automatic physics — to assist potentially deadly analysis.
Legislative authorities have recently changed in the regulation to enable schools to make adrenalines with less difficulties.
Notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with allergical reactions.
Children may say: "That feelings like something you're in my language," "I have a hair in my language" or "slipper's slipper."
Inter-Sexual Children Parents may choose "indefinite gender"
Germany became the first European country who recognized the third part of children born with interim sex bodies.
Newborn will not be required to accept a man or woman's gender.
The new law does not require parents to call any of such children, allowing parents to specify the “indefinite” or “uninstalled” in their birth testimony.
The goal of the law was to remove pressure from parents that could take slow decisions on the transmission of the newborn, and to oppose discrimination of inter-sessional people.
One intersectional man, according to BBC, said many years later, "I'm not a man and not a woman."
I'm still a doctor with blue and smells.
An average of two thousand children who are birthing annually is not a boy or a girl.
They have intersectionality, one of about 60 pathological states under the diagnosis of sexual development — a collective term for people with typical chromosomes, gonades (aintic or sementors) or unexpectedly developed by armed sex organs.
Walter Simpson may have been an intersectional.
Generic identification is still insufficient, but most experts in the United States say that, if the age cannot be determined, better use and bring it to the child to wait and monitor psychological and physical development before operations.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drecher, who specializes gender identification issues, said that the new German law “is a good idea.”
Inter-Sexual children are creating the ethical dilemma.
“ Some people have threatening violations that require operational involvement, but most of them have no, ” he said.
You can get off without operation and then see how the personality is developed.
It is not too accurate as a child has a gender identity.
Nobody can answer the questions why this happens.
It's like a note of why people feel homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersectional persons as different from trans-sexual or transgenders, since their status is not relative to the genitor, but to their biological construction, which is not exclusively a man or a woman's gender, and typically not specifically for both.
These features may be shown in secondary sex signs such as muscle mass, sharp, sweat and bodying; primary sex signs such as reproductive organs and genitality, or the structure of chromosome and hormones.
The report also provides a general presentation of discrimination with intersectional and transgenital persons in the field of employment, as well as on the level of prejudiciary, cruelness and crimes.
Childs with gender abuse now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already authorized adults to put a man, woman or third-party in their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia, Norrie May-Walby, became the first person in the world who was recognised “besple”, was the right to maintain the“indefined” sex status throughout the life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, German passports will be used the third marking in addition to M and F to X, namely intersectional.
In the neighbouring of France, gender issues still have an opposition in accordance with the newspaper of France 24.
In 2011, decades of French lawyers, which were expressed by the Catholic country, were signed by a petition of the “general theorie” from school students.
The American Catholic Web site also expressed inconvenience with the German law, wrote that “in the situation where the world is involved in a new state of election, and the sexual activity is not, we turn another two pillars of civilization”.
A mother of the newborn child from Maryland also reported the baby zone website that she would like to be established at birth.
“Beating a child is sufficiently hard and without additional limitations, especially if you don't know by your child,” she said the website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
The historical children born with men and women’s sex organs called hermafrodotes, named the beautiful Greek god, who had the signs of both gender.
And only ten years ago, the medical community took Gender as a letter to which it can stand and then write again.
But now many interfere with the ethical basis for surgery, known that gender identity is complicated, and the doctor sometimes does an innocent choice, not knowing how a child will take her dedicated gender when he grows.
“In the midst of the XX century, it was called "unnecessary psychiatric case", said Dresher.
When they were born, you didn’t call a psychiater — you called surgery.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with interim genetics was proposed by Dr. John Many from the University of Johns Hopkins, who thought that the genitor was easy to change.
He introduced the term “general identity” and claimed that the environment signals, including social, as parents grow children, were interacting with the genes and hormones of the child, determineing whether a person would be considered a man or a woman.
But in one case, in 1966, his theory was questioned.
He recommended that the child whose penis was damaged during the unburned circumcision, completely covered the child, removed his bones, and growed as a girl.
“ Mani presented cases as a successful example of transition, but it was not true, ” said Dresher.
When he was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married to a woman.
But he was 38 years old.
Drecher said that some doctors still “applicate this model” now.
But in the 1990s, with the Internet arrival, people who survived these sex changes have declared themselves “unpleasant results”.
This was also the case of Jim Bruce, 36-year-old writer of the State of Montana, who was born with male XY, but the genetics of interim type.
The doctor could not exactly determine whether he had a great clitori or a small penis, and were convinced that he could never be able to live in a man 'complete life'.
As a result, rapidly after his birth in 1976, the external gender organ and the brakes of Bruce were removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He began to give women’s hormones under 12 years of age.
“I knew I was not a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unfortunate, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
He was appointed in 18 years.
But in depression and understood that something was wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he learned was horrible.
I was sterilised at birth, and nobody told me about this.
Bruce was born with a violation of gender development, which did not allow him to produce sufficient testing for normal development.
When he learned the truth, he became a man again, obtaining the skin of the testisteron and removed his smell.
Operation made him unclean.
He today speaks to protect others in the organization called Interface Project, trying to bring people to an intersectionality standard.
However, Ann Tamar-Matetis, Executive Director of the Califore Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “invites the smile and smuggle to advise.”
" Many activists are concerned that the German law would encourage parents to make a decision slowly and to give a child a “indefinite gender”," she said.
We're afraid he's going to contribute to the involvement.
We think it's better to get a man or a woman's fellow, and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law would be understood, so everything we can do is building the provisions.
Tamar-Mattis said that its organization supports Australian law, since “there allows adults to choose for the third field”.
“ adults must have the opportunity to take their own decisions on formal sex,” she says.
The German law undermines its dedication at birth.
This is a conviction in which small children should not enter into this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions on their own body.
However, Dr. Arlin Baratz, a mother-rentgenologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter in violation of sexual development and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law “submits” both parents and children.
The daughter of Baraz, Katy, was born with husband chromosomes, but she has a violation of sexual development, named “the syndrome of full inconsciousness to androgen”.
As her advertising receptors are incorrectly working, the women ' s signs have been discovered.
She has a power, but there's no wheat and birds.
Now, in 29 years, Katie is married and is a child psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although it is unfaithful, it is hoped to be a parent through the incorporation of or the gestatic substance.
“ Zakhdon gives time to parents to not take the slow decisions itself, ” said Baraz.
It gives them time to make any analysis and to consider in the situation, as well as the interim time before they write the “wives” or “wives”.
In that case, you are fine — growing a child, loved by a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't need to do a operation that is unexpected.
“ This allows children to participate in decisions and to eliminate the concern that their parents move, because they are not feeling right, ” she says.
At the end of the time, a child decides to be more comfortable with her or her — and it is wonderful.
This allows children to make decisions self-determined.
"Chicago" Nicolay Habibulin emphasized: He understands that he should play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work on training.
At the last two meetings, Habbibulin first passed six chairs from Tampa Bay, and then four of the Ottawa, which was replaced in the second game after the fourth shirt.
We have to play well, and in the last two games, I couldn't get it -- brings CSNChicago to Habibulin's words.
- I need to find a reliability in training, probably to go to them as a game, and to try to get the best result.
You must study your last games and work on the shortcomings that were.
There are some small components that I have to improve, but at the training I feel very good.
But for some reason, after a few heads, it's all turning into a dark coma.
Maybe I need a little relax.
I don't think that I'm that one - always trying to make a perfect game.
If I lose four, five, six, I'm not in a shock.
I don't care what happens before my doors.
I'm still working on myself to not miss such a shirt.
Good, my colleagues support, but in principle, it's simply that I have to play better.
Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to make them better.
But what happened.
I have to put it on the side.
I'll just try to play the next shop better.

Medve vs. SSJ-100 will be placed in Europe
Russia considers that the 100 Superject flights will also be put into Europe after the late America markets and Asia.
"We consider that, in the general complexity, we will receive such agreements more than 170 aircraft exemplary, " provides an interfax " of the words of the Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medveveveva, which they have been discussed at the press conference with the President of France Jean-Marko Aero.
Head of the Russian Government noted that with French colleagues there was a serious cooperation, since it was a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to the insurance today, but we hope that the aircraft will be strengthened on the markets of Latin America and Asian and the Pacific region, as well as our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will ever be placed in France," emphasized the Russian prince.
SSJ-100 is a flight built by the Suhjo Civil Aircraft company in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and proposes high quality and comfort standards at 100 passenger places.
The Day's Energy began a unique rescue program...
In the elderly to reach the gardens, the villages on a high column, and the heavy nest standed well on it.
These special opposites have not been long ago, so the assists loved the columns of electronic warning lines, and the flowing winds are shocked on the guide, with which the assist switch is reliable.
The grandmother Anja, whose house in the town of the Petrick area has lived twenty-ninth years ago, has noted how the snake sits, despite all his efforts.
The birds have a new wheel over the top, and the lower slide between the drivings are moving here.
Of course, the painful family of the actors who were sneaking every year in the shore was shocked and sentenced by three-four birds in the summer, but they did not want to remain without light.
Only the birds in the warm land, the grandmother Annie called at the King’s REX, which belongs to the opposition.
And I didn't even hope that there was so fast reacting.
When our specialists came to Ivanuk, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, - told the technical director of the DTD "Dneproproliferergo" Sergey Belize.
The guidelines that were in fact already inside the nest, 150 to 200 kilograms, began corrosion.
At any time, birds could die from electricity.
Indeed, local people were risked to stay without light because of the damage.
Thus, line monsters have started a nest saving operation, which has not already been in our first practice.
They have helped scientists and ornitologs from the Daily National University who have developed a nest transfer scheme.
They trained the district network staff.
The famous day ornithologist Alexander Poomaarrenko consulted energy at all stages of the nest reconstruction.
For the beginning, it was noted that there were more than 50 Asian apartments in the situation of accident.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were covered for the throne.
The main snake was shocked with snakes, and then they moved the old nest there.
It is noted that it is enough to put old winds as a basis for the birds to learn the nest and return to it.
The assists have already built their homes.
The first nest was rebuilt in the village of Peachanka of New York.
A new ironethane column was placed with electricity and was placed on it with an older, skilled nest.
The whole operation was covered by energy in nine thousand grivens.

Message: Obama's predicted headquarter considered the exception of Bayden for Hillary Clinton
The New York Times reported that the next advisors of President Barack Obama had considered the possibility of replacement by Vice-President Joe Bayden's candidate Hilary Clinton in the election list of 2012.
This opening is the most brilliant senation of all the books expected by Mark Galperin and John Hayleman on the 2012 campaign "Twides: Game has changed in 2012".
The Times issued an exemplary prepared for the exit of the book and reported on the fourth evening that the next assistants of the President had conducted “the largest research in the focus groups and the surveys of the public opinion at the end of 2011” to assess whether the exclusion of the Bayden could help to re-elect the hopes of Obama.
According to the report of the political advisor The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt of high-employed officials of the predicted stage and the White House, namely the former head of the White House Administration Bill Dale, to assess the effects of the appointment of an ex-president of Clinton's vice-president.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected in the Chicag pre-selection stage and in the Occupy Office.
Only six of the nearest advisers of the President, including Daley, the former head of Obama Messina's predicted stage, and the former bigger advisers of the White House David Axelrod and David Pluff, knew that the replacement was considered.
The "Stavkeys" book states that Daley was an initiative to replace Bayden, despite their 'persistent relationships', but finally rejected the step when their data showed that the addition of Clinton to the election list was not “the important chance of Obama”.
In the interview with Martin Daley, the Administration realized the possibility of the replacement of Bayden Clinton.
“ I expressed actively for consideration of many things, and it was one of them, ” said the newspaper.
You should remember that at that time the President was in a terrible form, so we thought, "God, what are we doing?"
Although Daley was enhancing a study as a “required check”, Martin told the representative of CNN Anderson Cooper that the predicted stage was sufficient to investigate whether this step would lead to the vote.
“Medium-elected stages do not cost such money for surveys and group focuses, if they do not consider anything,” said Martin in the AC 360 programme.
But it was not clear that Obama knew that his team had studied the replacement possibility.
Martin told the CNN that he asked Daley whether he knew his boss about the possible transfer.
Although Daley said he was not thinking that the President was “in the course” a possible replacement, the former head of the Administration acknowledged that Obama knew.
Martin added that “States are double” did not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political consignment to the Obama table were achieved.
Cooper asked Martin if he was seriously thinking that Obama didn't know about the possibility of deleting Bayden from the election list.
“ Maybe, ” said Martin.
Do you want a lighter in the dark?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first light in dark marine by means of the media.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent qualitys of the sea animal to develop light food.
He came to this idea, read a scientific article on the media, and convinced the scientists in China to restore the light white.
The skin is in response to the language of the man who eats it, increased the level of pH in the skin and put it to light.
Chris says that since the marine starts to light when it reacts to warm route, it means that you're more than you're lying, so it's bleeding.
Charlie, the founder of the marine production company "Lisney, I'm sweet," says, "This is an incredible thing, but still in the first stage, if you're talking about the production, so you'll get about 2 g substances."
The Belock we use in the marine is reacting with your language at the neutral pH.
So when your mouth blends a white, it will increase the pH level and the marine starts to light.
We tested it over the past few months, and it seemed to be perfectly present to Hellon, because it creates such a wonderful effect.
This may be the most precious marine of what I did, because the luminancement of the meau is four times the gold road.
So every shirt's supposed to be about £140.
It's so nice to the smell.
Charley's experimental company, located in Bristol, is known as its unfair shoes, including bird, grain, sweat and sweat of soft gold.
But his next creation should be more ambitious.
He said, "I want to develop an invisible marine."
It is impossible to define that it is because of the bleeding of ice crystals, which is marine, but I think we're gonna find a way to do it.

Ruby's spanish cocktail fled after a small DTD
After three days she was in the carriage, he noticed the man who shocked the dog
Firefounds were cut down on a shift circle to save a dog from the unminished loss
It was still forced to save the fire teams after they were called to get it up and bring it to a safe place, after he was somewhat slowed up to 50 feet (50 feet) to a dangerous swimming circle.
A nine-eighth-spain-speaker runs after the car accident on Sunday, and passed three days alone before the carriage was saved.
Her host, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Holl, were at the carrière of Fleepped in Denholm, western New York City, to join Ruby, and thank you for the rescue service of West Yorkshire.
They were freely looking for their lost dogs and placed treatment on social network sites after she fled to the carriage after a small accident.
About 14:15 in the midst of the star dog, Ruby noted that the carriage was 50 feet (50 feet) higher.
The technical saving room with the fire station of Clexiton speeded to the location of the event, slowed down to the crews to save Ruby and used a transfer to get it upstairs on the circle.
The Savior Officer Andy Clayton said, “he was in dangerous situation.”
She was just in the middle of a swimming circle — 50 feet [50 ft] to the top and to the earth.

We are so grateful, and everyone of them was absolutely grateful.

The fires were shocked.
I can't just believe she's there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't win with Kate Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview in the Australian Radioshop on this week, post-star said that it was a bike-vocalist for Jagger 2004 Old habits the hard.

George Kerevan: The breakdown of Europe gives the Skotlands a choice
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time, we warn that the independent Scotia will be joined into the general European free movement area as conditions for membership in the EU.
The passport control stories in Berbik and the border of the Adrian Way.
Indeed, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed out the possible economic benefits of more free movements in the rest of Europe, although, as we predict, it was not in the titles.
Nobody also indicated that the EU Member States have spent a lot of time to highlight their formal rules as they were appropriate.
As Skotland is now not in the Shanghai Zone, the continuation of the non-observation requirements will be a delay for Brussels instead of what he really wanted from the Skotlands.
So it's not a remarkable attention to the story.
And the old thing she turned into a channel: first I heard "tonight" that "independence means passport control", at least 40 years ago.
However, there is a interesting moment lost when the old speech reported.
Why should the independent Skotland perform the commandments of Europe?
Why can I change London's ice to Brussels, especially now?
This is the European news: the great subsequent plan to join Europe finally has been implemented.
With the Eurocrisis project Europe, it is officially dead.
In all the European Union, the parties who speak against the EU or for the elimination of the euro as a single currency shall take force.
Even in Germany, the Alternative for Germany, which was based only this year, appeared from the country and received almost five million votes from the Federal Democracy of September, thus exhibited the Free Democracy (any of our Liberal Democratics) from Budapest.
There was always an internal opposition to the Federal Europe Plan.
However, the current economic crisis has become a deterioration.
Measures of the Great Economy introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and shops put into national economies through the maintenance of a single currency have brought many people to think that the Europe project was too far.
The euro crisis was little related to the work of the national governments with excessive budget deficiencies, which was justified only for Greece.
Indeed, the Eurostat has blocked its members on common courses for German exporters, that German policies and desire to maintain.
Without the possibility of the national currency of Southern Europe, there is an unexpected production situation in comparison with Germany.
The only savings are to reduce payments and public costs that are actively supported by Berlin.
The current budget and currency issues are the more deep problem of Europe's production capacity.
As a result of the complex of measures on green energy in Brussels, a cipher that means supporting French and German energy companies through consumers, the European industry is twice more than electricity and four times more than the United States.
It's a paralysising worthy conditions, as we have seen in Greydgemouth.
There is no world-wide wage prevention for the decreasing winning of the US low-based gas over the European non-technological industry.
This results from the burnt, especially in France, the most wreckful of the EU side.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin is no longer necessary for political legitimacy in Paris and has already linked its own economic policy in Europe, left the devastated economy of France in a poor situation.
The result is the right to speak against the EU party Marin Le Penn National Front just wining decisive elections by shutting the rule of socialists on the third place.
The “Front” is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the votes — the timely warning of the British library that it is not possible to get out of the provision that is automatically discovered among the left.
What does Le Penn do with his newly open popularity among the French white work class?
She wants to use elections in the EU in the next year to create blocks in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If, and that is very likely, the EU party will receive support for these elections, this block can first take the household position in the European Parliament.
This is my view: the rapid growth of the EU and the single currency in Europe are slow to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become a kind of “Europe of the Sovereign nations” that liked General de Goll.
Germany and a few dependents of it may keep the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I suggest that Britain is disastering from this project to hope to draw close to the United States.
However, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific shows the possibility that Britain remains without attention to the Atlantic cold.
What situation does it leave Skotland?
We can choose to be a region (in fact) of small England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, besides otherwise, send Berlin and Brussels to the fucks.
I suspect that Skotland can overcome a more free European treaty, provided that we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other one-industrial countries will be easier in the informal Europe.
On the other hand, we should consider the possibility of repeating the experience of Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Skotland National Party is, as a strange, the most successful political movement in Europe aimed at combating a heavy economy that has received a majority of votes in 2011 by reflecting the reduction of the costs proposed (and realized) legitimate channel of Alister Darling and the consequences of the coalition of the Tor and Liberal Democracy.
Skotland would now be able to vote for independence only to take steps to the green economy involved in Berlin and Brussels.
Previous sexual conspiration: preceding
African and Latin American girls have generally reached a full snack before their white neighbors showed research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual conspiration is close
No evidence that hormones or other chemicals are condemned
Experts believe that the epidemia of fermentation may be one of the launching mechanisms of early gender resurrection
Tendence to the early sex snake is not expressed in the boys
An ex-representant CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialized on child health and family issues.
Should the mother be afraid if her daughter begins to form the start of milk iron and to increase the hair of 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatria on this week in Orlando, Florida, the child endocrinologist, Dr. Paul Caplavitts, explained that these early physical changes were fully distributed among American girls and represented a new standard.
“ I have a lot of time for my parents to rejoice — it usually does not mean a fast invasion of full geographic, ” said Capevitz.
Evident development signs, such as growing grains, smells, and underlying hairs and body smells, are previously appeared in girls.
However, only a small change in the age of menarhee (first mention) was over the past four decades.
The average age in the United States was 12.5 years and was decreased in comparison with 12.75 in 1970.
“ As the grain begins to develop, at least two-third years before the menarhee,” said the author of the book The Recent Sexual Success: how to address this public problem.
The time is the most accurate verification of sexual conspiration.
The debate is that it is a real invasion of gender rape but it is considered to be “immediate” when the increase in the grain is slowly increased by growth to eight years.
In most cases the process is delayed or stopped, it is that the pediator can follow carefully.
More rapid progress can be a basis for analysis in the endocrinolog to eliminate serious problems such as sweet or shock.
There are procedures to keep early mestruction and prevent another consequence: premature older bones, which may eventually lead to delaying growth and low growth in age.
Recommendations on medical or hormonal therapy are based on age of children, development levels, growth rates and emotiveness.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
The publisher is careful with medicines but recognizes that “the use of sex inheritance may reduce conductive problems and feelings of girls that are different from September”.
Another great problem is that parents simply don't want to have a restructuring of their very young daughters.
“They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they are treated with hygiene matters,” said Capevitz.
“ This was a shock, ” remembers one woman whose daughter’s menstruction began in ten years.
Although signs were and we spoke of the menstruction, she was not emotively ready.
She came home from the school of a scared and disappointed school that she was the first among his friends.
There are many degraded theories about the reasons of early sexual conspiration.
Nevertheless, there is no follow-up evidence that hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual shipments in mass information.
The boys, as well as girls, have previously come to sexual conspiration.
The Chief claims that the preference of the weight is the episode of fertilizing.
In 2001, he helped a study of girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which links the number of grains in the body to the period of sexual abuse.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other factors.
In that country, African and Latin American girls are generally reached by sexual snack before their white neighbors.
There are various explanations.
In the whole world, the premature sexual conspiration, in the whole sense, affects all the things: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another note: Although the child’s hair appears in a younger age, tendency to full early sex is not expressed as girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP Conference have confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The demonstration of smell and smell hair is found at the youngsters and children of a clear age.
“ We must be careful about how we determine the true invasion of geographical snacks, ” said Mr. Lawrens Silverman, a child endocrinologist in the Holiday Hospital in Mr. Morristan, New Jersey.
Parents should not be able to receive instructions from the pediator about how to speak to their child.
“ This may mean more early than it was expected, ” explained Capevitz.
If you keep peace, your child normally reacts well.
The girls who grow early must be confirmed that even when this happens before, this process is a normal part of life.
The United States Boeing in Reading is ready to get out
The aircraft carried out under the Open Neighborhood Treaty on Russia's Territories and the unplanned aircraft in Chita, the United States Airport on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 to the Moscow time will leave the city airport.
The airport’s conduct has been authorized by a ship fleet, obtaining a fuel pay.

On the other hand, he's going to the United States.
As reported, the flight flight in Ulan-Wod was landed in the Zabaykal area because of the tsunami.
It was not issued from Chita's airport because of the unpauted accounts.
30 people, including equipage, two nights on the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
As reported in MID RF, in accordance with the conditions laid down in the open sky Treaty of the aircraft, people have no right to go outside the Chita Airport, they may be able to control the border only in two Russian airports, in Cuba and in Ulan-Wude.
The open heaven contract was signed in 1992, 34 States participated in it.
Objective boards are carried out on the territorys of Russia, the United States, Canada and Europe.

Reactive aircraft producers affect the seat width when large commands
Among the manufacturers of aircraft, a devastate controverse of the width of the tourist class on further rays led to a ton to a terrible conflict on the Dubai aircraft in that month.
The spot returns around the width of the seats provided on further magic passengers of the class, whose interests are not always in the aircraft's attention centre, while the amount of chosen space plays a key role in approving the effectiveness of recent aircrafts proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
The airbus in this week called for the introduction of a sector standard that would provide the width of the seat at least 18 dpi (46 cm) in the economic class halls, but its main American competition Boeing said that this should be resolved by aviation.
The difference is when aircraft producers are decorated in the sales of their two-motor aircrafts, and the events of 17-21 November are likely to be recurred.
The back of the plane, especially if 9 or 10 persons are sit in a series, is central in the statements on the economic efficiency of new “mini-aebouties” projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will be 406 persons, from the economic classe of more than 17 dpi in wide ranges of 10 in each series.
Airbus said that its competitive version A350 will be transported to the Economy of 350 persons on the seats of a width of 18 dpi, which is 9 in a series.
Auto-release guigans are often interchanging technical attacks through the publicity in professional press.
Now, Airbus is directly addressed to the public before the aircraft in Dubai, where 777X is expected to be leader of more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated how to start a new advertising war, showed to the funders of the slade that pictured three people in the restaurant who wanted each other with the name "Do you agree with this?"
“Boeing offers further magic fleet on seats more closer than regional carbovine flights, ” said the director of Airbus John Liki.
With a change in food ratio, people take weight, but the airlines have not been cardinally changed.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, the broadfood Boeing 747 provided the standards of modern further trips, and the medium-American men in the age of 40 to 49 years increased by 10 per cent, according to the United States Health Department.
The talent of a medium-american man in the 21th century is 39.7 d in the statistical data of the United States Health Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor is holding up the concept of the 1950s, when the average rate of the talents of those recently called “reactive publishing” was already.
Airbus said that a study showed that the additional twin in the width of the seat increases the quality of sleep at 53 per cent.
Boeing opposes airbus digits on seat size and says that the manufacturers should not be involved in decisions on how aircraft balances are found between taxes and goods.
In its words, the study shows that the goodness of the salon is not only dependent on the width of the seat.
“Indeed, the aircrafts are providing to the election companions and to do what they have to do in order to achieve success,” said the specialist Boeing on Kent Craver's sloves.
They don't want us to decide for them to bring them the profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
The question for passengers is to increase the space on the side, but the producers are increasingly a factor that may affect profit.
The controversy is a shock of airlines estimated at least $7,00 billion per catalogue prices in the nearest decade, enough to change the proportion of the United States and European export.
As the first reported in July, the seat position was that the struggle between the new reactory aircrafts is undergone to the struggle.
As Airbus and Boeing declare that the 20 per cent of profitability is in one place in their last two-motor additional magic models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365-center Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing features are partly based on the comparison of 10 rows 777X with the original 9-local component of the constructive decision 7777.
The winning of certain self-reliance is reduced in comparison with a 10-local company currently used.
“The risk in which Boeing does this is to get more place and make his aircraft more competitively compared to our developments,” said Kevin Kenstoon, head of the Airbus Traveller Comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that salons with fully 10 lines for the existing 777 are indicated that many passengers prefer a fleshly disappearing that can go on hands with lower taxes.
“The sydeny of a width eighth twice would be perfect for passengers, but the reality of this is that the Airbus's proposal was threatened by the 777th model,” said the specialist, on the interview of Mary Kirby, the founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not set a box, but they propose the directory of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Training aircrafts in peace even takes a routine to check competitive planning.
By enhancing the comfort, all producers also propose aircrafts with a very fleshy company for the budgetary aircraft and regional transits.
Airbus proposes A350 with 10-style lines, but he says that she did not sell it yet.
Having recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional adaptations to the salon, proposing a more broader passage on some of its flights.
Without support of the only other large modern aircraft manufacturer, as the experts say, it calls to the new sector standard instead of flights, but may be highlighted from the trails of the 777X models.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may avoid the smoking process of satisfaction
scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could lose the smoke process.
One pre-vacuum was able to protect the mouse from nicotine dependence throughout the life.
More tests are needed before the testing of people, which needs a few years, but Professor Ronald Cristal from the medical college Wayl Cornel in New York stated that the first results were the results.
“We are very hoped that this vaccine application strategy may finally help millions of smokers who tried to shoot all methods today on the market, but have found that their nicotin dependence is sufficiently strong to survive it through these modern means,” said Professor Cornel.
New vaccine contains an improper virus that was developed to provide genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus is selectively infected by the pig cells that then begin to produce a stabial anticorps flow.
Antitecles survive any nicotine molecules in blood by neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker of nicotine attack.
In the tests of vaccinated muscles, which later gave nicotin, continued their normal activity.
And the muscles that were not given in vaccine were "sneak", and this is the sign of Nicotin's arrival to their brain, says the researchers.
These experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous taxi vaccines suffered failing because they had a anticorps.
To maintain the high level of antitle, the skins needed to do so often that they were good and non-operative.
But the value of the new vaccine would probably be much lower because it transforms the pig cells into the anti-tle factory.
Professor Cristal said that if the future human vaccine would be fully safe, it would be possible to give children before they want to try to smoke, prevent nicotin dependence.
But more likely she's going to be used by smokers to leave smoke.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not receive satisfaction from this because of the nicotine vaccine, and that may help them to get away from this attraction,” he said.
The British scientists said that the results were interested, but warned that additional research needed.
Oilers: Third agriculture of the Sub-Substitute are completely available
The Sub-Mosk Goal Vice-Gubernament, Juria Olayner, stated that nearly the third rural villages of Moscow are fully substantial.
The total allocation of the region ' s budget receives 187 populations from 288.
In 2013, 187 people from 288 receipt of the area budget.
A certain amount of expenditure income of 122 rural populations exceeds 50 per cent, and 83 per cent.
In the framework of the budget guarantee of the area budget, 25 billion rubbers are sent,” said Olyns.
The Vice-Gubernate also noted that only in three urban settlements, the Mutiti, the single and Pusino budget income is more than 1 billion rule for 2013.
Income in agriculture in many regions of less than 3 million rubbers, "that is not enough".
The expenditure of the local administrative device in 88 submissions is over 70 per cent, " which is observed by the decline of the quality of services", stated Olympics.
He had previously mandated heads of municipal education to consider the populations needed to be restructured, linked to urban districts or changed by the administrative system.
These proposals will be made up to the end of January.
To that end, the Governor of Moscow stated that the Administrative Reform in the Submuseum plans to reduce the number of rural housing.
Also, in the Mojay, Kashshire, the Solar Bayer, the Colombian regions, the Luxemburgs and the Coteinans, there are requests for municipalization.
The discussion of this issue in the cities and regions of the region begins in November.
The President of the Munition of Jord Bresself also stated that the whole unit was planned for approximately 30 rural populations in 12 sub-Subs.
This has been linked to the fact that from the 178 rural populations in the Sub-Mediterry less third, the financial basis is acceptable, and the 100 subscriptions.
Diana Arbeniina replied Helloud with her children
Diana Arbeniina does not cover what great joy it receives from the education of her children.
In spite of what is now, Armenia gives a lot of time to creativity and public activities, it is still the opportunity to return with Martha and Artem, which is not only time for their education but also to develop as possible.
In the last week, Diana was twice read before his worshipers about their pedagogical talents.
First she posted a photo in Facebook, which she shows how to teach children to read.
And last night he was talking about the fans, showing how Artema and Martha were inherited on Helloud.
Our first halloween is ready to go to the legs, and it was called Diana's photo of his children in the celebration costums.
What is unwise, since they have no other Russian boys and girls with regard to this feast because they were born in America.
Germany first in Europe introduces the "unspecified gender" in the registration of children
Germany will become the first country in Europe, where children born by hermphrodites are authorized instead of men or women ' s "indetermined " .
Parents will be entitled to leave the “poly” graph in a witness to the birth of an incomplete.
Instead of "F" or "M" parents may record "X" (not specified).
This decision is aimed at not sublineing the parents to the speed with the "determination" operation of the field.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is a hermafroduit.
Thirds refuse that the influence of Obed
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Trimou, will be a figure of investigation of the anti-corruption supervisory body of the State.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Trimoy, is checking the changes in the order of prior objects on request of his political employer, Eddie Obad, who was secretly owner of the duties in three objects of impairment in the State.
The independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation of Mr. Obeid in several ministers of State for the proliferation of the Arrangements in Serkular Kii, where the family Obeid belonged to two restaurants and cafes, without the time of the tendor after the expiration of their action in August 2005.
She now examines the approximation that Mr. Trimoy knew the secret participation of Mr. Obeid in unmovable objects, following the indication of data by the former Vice-Chairman of the Administration, Mr. Trigoy, Linn Ashpoul, on Friday.
Over a few years of the discussions started in 2005, the Government urged the open competition.
Ardenators were opposed to this, and they also wanted more long terms of shipment.
In 2009, Enterprises for Cercullar Kie, who provided the Occupy family $2.5 million per year, were extended without open competition.
Mr. Trichoy, Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, originally spoke for open competitions.
But he refused that changes were made on request by Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Trifoy acknowledged, recommended to make changes in the army policy of the Government.
In August and September 2007, Mr. Obeid, Mr. Trifoy and Steve Dunn, an elderly official in the Ministry of Ports in the fisheries office of Mr. Obeid, in August and September 2007.
“As a question discussed during the phone conversation, is the development of the commercial arranty policy,” asked Commissioner Antony Wilil, Mr. Trichoy.
"No," said Mr. Trihoy.
I can't remember what it was discussed, but it's certainly not.
Of course not between me and Mr. Ode.
According to the high-employed official, Israeli military aircraft attack the goals in Syria
The high official of the Fox News interview confirmed that Israeli military aircrafts attacked the Syrian port of Lattakia on Tuesday night.
The official didn't state that it was for the purpose, but he said, at least one.
The “Association Press” reports that the aim of Russian production SA-125 was to be missed.
At least two times ago in this year, Israel shipped shipping loads with missiles within Syria.
Foreign work on sub-class visa may be tested at "justice"
The “reality” test for foreign workers at Classe 497 is being reviewed by the Government, since it notes the expansion of repressive measures.
The test, in the case of its adoption, will be applied under criteria for preventing the use of the visa of class 477 to fill the unabled posts or as a lace for the movement of family and friends in Australia.
The document submitted by the Government was published today, while the former League-Deputy Maxine McKu discovered the ritories of the Government regarding foreign workers, said that this could be widespread by the neighbouring of Australia.
“Another declaration of the type of "foreigners, at the end of the race" and "the first work of the Australians" represents a very unpleasant disappearance at the time when the professionals demanded the protected labour market,” she stated today at the Australian Institute.
It was historicly meaning that the white work was to protect - and if some in the region had seen the rejection of this historical art, I wouldn't surprise.
The document presented in the discussion is 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration by Chris Bouwen.
The Minister of Immigration of Brendan O'Connor, who was eve in Sri Lanke, where he meets official persons on the contractual person, has already made five of the recommended changes and the remainders are at the stage of consideration.
If the criteria of “reality” are adopted, the applicant may be investigated in order to “experience the candidate when a candidate is a parent or a close owner or a person with a company financing.”
The undertakings may also need to be counted on the number of owners of sub-classuse 497, since the undertakings that were intended to spend a small number of employees, then took hundreds of workers.
Between the 35-year-old Sri Lanka, who seeks rescue, died from the inflation after the arrival of the ship with refugees on the island of Christmas in that week.
The murdered nine-year-old son of the man led him on the way to Australia, and from the death of his father in the midst supported a two-year-old brother who was also on the board.
Australian authorities were successfully sent to a man to the hospital of Christmas Island where he died.
The friend of Semen Varlamma said that okkinist suffered by alcoholism
A friend of the Hooked Semen Varlamom of the European Union stated that it suffers from alcoholism, transmits the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea of how to stop drinking," she said, in particular, a woman.
Remember, the Bavarianic was sent to the court for the slaughter of the Russian Semen Varlamom, who is also a member of the Corrodo Club.
As she said, the okkeyist shocked her for his hair, and he slaughtered her - after the attack, the hands, the shoes, and the shoes were damaged.
Varlamom himself came to the police of Denver and acknowledged the destruction, detailedly described what happened.
He was arrested, but later he was set up at $5,000.
The court was not limited to the sports movement in the country but prohibited approaching to the Bavarianic.
He also threatens prison until six years of domestic violence.
The Government of the United Kingdom has announced a study aimed at improving the economic effects for Skotlands from the project of the HS2 carriage magistrate.
Draft HS2 proposes the opening of a high-enlargement communication with Skotland and North England, with the beginning of the first stage in 2026
The Minister of Transport of Baroness Cramer noted that the project “United the United Kingdom”.
The Minister of Transport of Skotlandia, China Brown, said that he was in the sight of the planning work with the Government of Britain.
The first stage will be in the construction of a new high-encreased iron line between London and West-Midlands.
When the second stage is completed, the lines will be placed in Manchester and Lides.
In June, the Government reviewed the estimated value of the construction of a high-encreased line between London and North England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The Government of the United Kingdom, which conducts negotiations with Scotland Transport, urged HS2 Ltd to consider further improvement in the slow-scale and reduced travel costs to North England and Scotia.
This should include the possibility of crossing the road from Glasgo and Edinburgh in London for three hours or less.
Barones Cramer said: “We aim for HS2 to create a real national network that will make Britain and its city closer to each other.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits that it will give are great.
Without him, we're going to face the crisis of passing capacity in our iron shipping network.
However, it is also about the transport of cities; 18 cities, including Glasgo and Edinburgh, will be better received through HS2.
The Skotlands Hospital Alister Carmachel added: “The most annual declaration is a good news for Skotland.”
On behalf of the Skotland government, China Brown called on Mr. Karmikla to support the integration of Scotia in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-scale iron road has all the opportunities to bring great economic benefits in Scotia, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland in general arguments for high-scale iron roads throughout the United Kingdom.”
We therefore are pleased to work in partnership with the Government of the United Kingdom in order to consider the options of building a high-scale iron road in Scotia, creating benefits for all and continue to continue the coal line of Glasgo, Edinburgh, which is already planned by the Skotlandian Government.
I will wait to consider the results of the study with the British Ministers in the next year and to adopt a joint decision on the following steps.
Torre is a new hope of nuclear energy?
Governments in the whole world continue to think about how to ensure energy needs.
Hidrocarbons (which they are) are negatively affected by climate.
Renewed energy sources require large ranges for generation.
A atomic energy is not otherwise, but remains afterwards the mass of the roads in the notification of wastes.
Recently, scientists focused on the third -- another radioactive element of the Mendelassev system.
He meets around the world, and, as specialists say, his discharge does not leave waste that must be saved for centuries.
Rules of use of electronic aircraft devices in Australia until it remains in force
The Australian aircraft passengers will also need to be removed from their plans and phones during the flight and floor, despite measures in the United States on the relief of device data.
The Federal Aviation Office of the United States allowed American transporters to change their procedures so that passengers could read electronic books, view or play on their devices during the flight and flights, provided that they would remain in the Field Rey.
The passengers can already do this during the main part of the fleet, but many are disappointed that they do not have access to their electronic books during the flight and shipping.
Australian transporters consider this decision required by American aircrafts to carry out a great number of work to comply with new requirements, but indicated that they are not planning to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Security Office also noted that they considered this statement, but stressed that the limitation of the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases still worked in Australia.
“The security management of civil aviation fleet has no special rules to regulate the use of electronic aircrafts in aircraft” said it.
This issue is regulated by the rules required by aircrafts to ensure security at any time, and by passengers to comply with the security rule of which the escape members report.
The Virgin company, which had already discussed with the Office of Civil Aviation Safety, was not against changes, but said that it would follow the rules of the regulator.
“We would be grateful to consider the Office of Civil Aviation Safety Question on the authorisation of the use of electronic devices, as we really think that it will improve the quality of customer services now when it (the switchless shipping system) is on our flights,” said the secretariat.
Qantas stated that the rules of procedure would be maintained at this time.
“ Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during the flight and floor, and in the nearest time we are not planning to change it,” she stated.
FAU is distributed to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will, of course, study the decision of the FAU and the reasons that it has taken.
For the United States transporters, the infringement of the decision will vary from the aircraft to the aircraft and depend on the age of their aircraft.
Transporters should prove that their aircrafts have sustainability to radio-auditors from mobile devices, as well as to review supports, training materials, handboard standards and instructions for passengers.
“If the aircraft checks and confirms its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as planners, electronic books and spotphones at any height,” states FAU.
In several cases, the escape will give indications to passengers to disable their devices during the flight.
In addition, in accordance with the recommendation of the group, the harder devices should be placed under the seats or in high shuttles during the flight and shuttle.
The Dagestian Head of Extremism is heard in the Kubani mountain
The football shop between "Angie" and "Kubaanu" has been in a political collision between the authorities of the Krusodarland and Dhaguestan after the Dutch grained the Dutch Flag, and Mr. Kubani was shocked in a age.
Head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatiff, on the fourth day, invited the Republican parliamentars to go to the court, since the Gunn of the Krusodar area would call for an international discretion, in particular call for war with "busurmans".
Take the jinn of the Cross dark, which has been adopted in 1995.
It's a shock, and no one does it.
"O you here remember the mother of the family, the enemy, the enemy, we are going to the death battle" - for which such words can be recorded in the jinn, to bring some believers to the other believers," expressed the solidarity of the Abdulative Chairman's parliament of Hizri Shishaid.
Putin's impunity for his friend Asad
And now, news from the ocean, which is from Syria, where we know today, Israel has attacked the Russian production missiles that, in the message, called Hezbolle.
Today, Syria has fulfilled the important condition to destroy its production of chemical weapons until 1 November.
This was made within the framework of a Russian agreement and the envoyed United States not to perform an military operation which they had been able to take place during the past.
More details of the weapons and what it means for the Syrian President, our principal international representative Richard Engel.
Washington stated that the Assad regime will be punished for it.
More than 1400 peaceful inhabitants, including hundreds of children, died in August from equivalent gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombs, but in the form of a treaty built by a friend Asad Vladimir Putin.
Syria is denied from its chemical weapons to the middle of the next year.
And today it's an important time.
The International Experts Group reported that Syria had issued declared manufactures for chemical production.
The longer-term and harder task is the destruction of the tons of chemical weapons and components to it.
As we understand, it's about thousands of tons.
Youngton said that the days of Asad were shocked.
I think Asad's got to go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it happens.
He doesn't have to get out of here.
But Asad remains.
And it feels more secure.
His troops are still using artilleries, missiles and shocks.
His opposites are displaced and badly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, and many are hungry.
Some need to take care of skins and skins.
Many believe that Bashar Assad has avoided punishment for massive murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement is the success of diplomacy, the inspectors condemned the Nobel World Prize, and Asad himself made the impression of a person prepared to cooperate.
Today, in Washington, the United States Ambassador in Syria had to answer the unfair questions.
When a child dies from hunger, his mother is not easier than being killed by chemical weapons.
Asad's still holding.
And weapon changes to power.

In Singapore's owners are good, while the medium class is difficult
In the Benderim Trade Center in Singapore Janani Amortharing, a golden bracelet, a shirt and a series in order to pay the school education of her daughter.
“My husband and I have just purchased the house, so all my money are in place,” says Mrs. Amorthalynga.
Although it has $3,000 ($24,00) per month as a administrator and her husband works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, in various parts of South-East Asia, where household debt grows, the valueMax, where it carries its business, became a third shuttle registered in Singapore's fund bar.
It is not just a fast way to get money (S$1300 for Mrs. Amorthalynga), but also almost as much as uncertain bank credits.
In Singapore, the annual rate of 17 per cent is generally efficiency — more than 15.4 per cent proposed in the United Overseas Bank Office, a local creditor with the branch in the same trade centre.
However, lombards have the advantage that they do not require credit ability checking or payment evidence and can provide credits faster than banks.
Thus, millions of people in the whole region are in the low-border, since families feel the pressure due to the increased value of life and rapid growth of household debt and consumers.
After five years of sustainable growth following a world financial crisis, and decreased credits undertaken by free monetary and commercial policy in developing economy, families with low and medium-sized income are in low-scale so as to compensate the reduction of income through the slow growth of their economy.
In this week, Standard & Poor's, the Rating Agency, has indicated the increase in the family credit duty, mainly due to the growth of the epothetics, as a factor of the risk for the creditability of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest rate of household debt to the monetary internal product in Asia.
Malaysia made this list from 80 per cent of UNHCR compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high-level of consumer debt in Thailand, which had been out of the technical recession in that week.
In the fourth meeting, the continued export reduction and the decrease of the consumer demand were shown.
“In fact, with the increased value of people in the average and lower part [income], they will search for ways to fill their income where they can only be able,” says Seng Seung Wonn, CIMB economicist, the Malaysian bank.
In the past two years, the high prices of gold have increased the speed that people make personal things, since they use the possibility of obtain money for their family reliefs.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the substances consigned in 200 swimming pounds of the city of State are gold.
People say: “The price of gold looks good, let’s put the gold cup of grandfathers and get it back in the next month. ”
In Thailand, EasyMoney's largest operator observed the increase in the number of customers using its offices in the past months to 20 per cent.
The growth in the low-border business is that the valueMax, the operator of the Bethel Division and 15 other in Singapore, is planned to expand not only in the neighbourhood of Malaysia, where he has four shops, but also in the borders of Asia, he says, the Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 per cent of S$66 million in the week as a result of the location of Singapore funds.
While some creditors argued the criticism of high-percentage rates, Ms. Jaah said that lonbard is not only proposing more slightly than other creditors, it does not also increase the debt directly.
“A clients have the objects they have already owned, and the monetation of individual assets does not increase the debt of households,” she says.
The scheme is an increasing public recognition as a means to obtain short-term funding.
In this regard, lambs are not only used by the categories of persons who are in a serious financial situation.
Both people in Singapore are also using the valueMax office, providing gold swimming or Rolex hour, which can give up to 60 per cent of their purchase value.
We're seeing customers from all parts of society.
“They include state persons who need to take money for commercial projects or investments, or undertaking a small business that is necessary to overcome temporary money difficulties,” says Ms. Yik.
Sometimes they just need money very fast.

Savings package of $325 million for the health of Tajikistan
The Federal Government urges that the savings package of $325 million for the weak health system of Tajikistan will be complemented by strict conditions that ensure that the Government of the State does not lose the funds of the State.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Pliberce, declared that the Society takes “urgent measures” to prevent the older crisis of the island's population, the higher chronic diseases and restrictions of the system.
The financing decision was adopted for four years after Government consultations with the independent Deputy Tasmania Andrew Wilki.
“The relationship has proposed an extra rescue package, which we believe will solve specific problems faced by the state,” said today Mrs. Plibersek.
The package of $325 million includes $31 million for planning operations.
More than 2600 operations, including ortodotic and cataractic disposal operations, will help to continue departure.
There are also money for ill-feed clinics without pre-reporting records, in Hobart and London, to improve the quality of receipt after the station, training of medical experts, psychological health services and the inclusion of personal electronic cards in local hospitals.
“ These investments will go to the explanatory doctors of the idea how to help Tasmanian health systems, ” said Mrs. Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tajikistan would work in a strict reporting and responsibilities regime.
The State will be required to support the current level of financing to receive money from the Society and to take into account monthly where it costs these additional resources.
The Commission of three persons will be established to ensure that the State provides services as effective and effective.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million would not be resolved, “if they do not follow the true reform that will put Tajik Health System on a more sustainable basis”.
However, he endorsed the Government for the response to his request of urgent assistance to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I hope that the federal assistance package will contribute significantly to the conclusion of the health system of this State from critical state,” said Mr. Wilson.
According to the Government of the State, these additional election procedures significantly compensate recent reductions.
However, the Federal Opposition Representative for Health Peter Datton believes that the current statement is “the decision of the same lacuna”.
“The risk we are here is that the Leabolist Government has cut $430 million out of health systems,” he said the ABC TV.
When the State government decreases almost half billion dollars and the Commonwealth contributes to 300 million, it is impossible to make good news.
Mr. Datton requested Mrs. Plybersex to ensure that no dollar from the saving package will be paid to an additional bureaucracy.
The screening of the Geum Nikla Romana Danny Didro may be able to admire the exceptional decree and historic details, but it is also more seriously understood than it should be.
The film, acting in France of the 1760s, tells the smiling history of Susan, a youth aristocratic sent to his family monster.
When she begins to boot, she experiences extreme brutality from the hands of the Sadiest and becomes an object of erotic fantasies for others.
The movie never goes to post or sense — and it's all the problem.
Because of its serious tragicity, the event is a risk of being tested as a slaughter and for audience.
Syria has destroyed its resources for chemical weapons, said the observer group
Syria has destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and bombs with equivalent gas, declared in the fourth of the international observer group, while inflicted cuttings were shocked in the northern country, far from one of the objects where toxic substances are stored.
The Syrian active group also stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The statement of the Organization on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made for one day before
The extreme deadline of 1 November established by the organization established in Hague so that Damask will destroy or “incapacity” all means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms that enable chemical substances to slow up with equivalent gas and to fill the bombs.
Confirming that it is the primary stage of destruction, the important season in an ambicium graph, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus in the midst of 2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria cannot produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus is still to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stocks.
The country, as they believe, has about 1000 tons of chemical materials and weapons, including heat gas and nervous gas.
This statement was made during the terrible battles in the town of Safira, where, in the view of experts, there is an object for the production of chemical weapons, as well as its guarding place, reports the base of the Syrian Centre for Human Rights.
The active group, who monitored the losses through the network of activists in Syria, stated on Thursday that 120.296 people died.
From that number, as stated, 61 067 are civilians, including 6365 children.
From the Government, he stated that 29,954 men were members of the armed forces of the President of Bashar Assad, 18 678 were the prosecutors and 187 Lebanese combats.
Even among the dead, as stated in the statement, were 2202 army overseers and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them were foreigners.
According to the UN assessment of 25 July, 1000,000 died in conflict since March 2011.
Since then, the number has not been updated.
The conflict drove about 2 million people to run from the country.
Assad's war for a few weeks in Safire was struggled with the forces, many of whom are related to the Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that the victims of both parties were on Thursday but did not bring specific data.
Boas emphasized the dangers faced by the chemical weapons inspectors covered by the deadlines of their mission for the release of Syria from the Toxic Arsenal, in the disaster of the continued civil war.
In the statement of the OHCHO, working closely with the United Nations, it states that its team was “here satisfied with the verification and view of all declared Syria's critical production and equipment for interacting/contracting.”
She added that “no further inspection activities are currently planned”.
The inspectors said that they had completed the first round of checking work, visiting 21 of 23 installations declared by Damay.
They couldn't visit two places from the security meetings, they said inspectors.
On Thursday, the OHCHR stated that both places were moved in other declared places that were checked.
It could not immediately find whether there was one of the two places that OHCH inspectors couldn't visit.
Syria presented a full plan for the destruction of its chemical weapons, which should be approved by the Executive Committee on the next month.
“I welcome the courage and closing that you all have demonstrated in the implementation of the most complex mission that has ever been taken by this organization,” said the Director-General of the observer group Ahmet Uzuimaj in the comments published by the OHCH.
The third year of civil war has been the rebellion, mainly the Islamic Sunnites, with the Government of Assad and its security forces, which are members of its headquarters, the response of the Shit Islam.
As regards other events, the Head of the Rami Abdulachman Center said that it was a strong explosion in the Mediterranean OMS object in the coastal province of Syria.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger because of the condemnation of the terrorists in Bali
The remaining 202 victims of the bombs died in Bali in 2002 had been angryly reacted to the condemnation of the last complainant who had been sentenced before the court and claimed that Urmar Pattex had to be shooted.
Patete, who spent nearly 10 years of fleet as one of the most discovered people in South-East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years of freedom for his role in establishing explosive devices used during therapy.
It may be released for 15 years if it is received a timely release.
The 45-year-old sentence was recognised in massive murders because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, where 202 people killed, including 88 Australians, and were still blessed.
He was also acknowledged by a number of other terrorism accused, including in the worst of the explosions of the church throughout Indonesia in Christmas Canadian in 2000.
The prosecutors needed a deadly period, although they could like to claim that a person called “submerger” for their reputation to the manufacture of explosive devices should be sentenced to the death penalty.
This decision has affected the illness of mother memories from Perth Juni Cortin, who had lost his 39-year-old neighbors Jane and Jenney's daughters in the therapy carried out by Patek and his messagers almost ten years ago.
She said that Patterson should be sentenced to the death penalty.
“I really think he must follow the stages of others.
He must be before the shooting team,” said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I must live every day, knowing that I will have no grandsons, and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sara Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was carried out outside the furgone, immediately after the 11th weekend of 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was in the Paddy Bar where a murderer terrorism was shocked by a shooting shooting shooting, just 20 seconds ago.
After that, he slaughtered in a month and died three times to be connected to the life-care system.
Mr. Huez said that Pattery should share the participation of the three other terrorist cell "Jama Islam" responsible for bloody fight, named Amrosy, Muslas and Samourah, who were sentenced four years ago.
Indeed, this man has more death punishment than everyone.
There's no reason to save him life.
Twenty years after he killed 202 people and blessed hundreds, it's not so much.
Patte is the last of the terrorist participants in Bali, represented by the court.
He was hidden for almost ten years, but finally he was detained in the Pakistan City of Abbottabad, where the American troops killed the former Head of Al-Qaida, Usaum Ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the judiciary, the FBI reported that the data were tested: Packy was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in trying to restore the relationship between the terrorism groups of South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
“ She didn't leave,” said Mrs. Cortin.
Before recently, he was not regretted about how pain he had caused others.
The sentence was made in the 10th anniversary of the terrorist, which will later be observed in Bali and Australia.
“In this year there will be much laugh,” said Mrs. Cortin.
The patent can still condemn his sentence.
FAU: “Aviation passengers can now use a flight switch (not calling with mobile phone)”.
The aviationists will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the fleet to read, work, play movies and listen to music, but not to mobile phones, according to the long-term new guidelines published in the Federal Aviation Management.
But passengers should not expect to change immediately.
As soon as this change will be implemented, it will be depending on the airline, said the Administrator of the FAU Michael Wart at the press conference.
Aviation companions should show FAU how their aircraft respond to the new guidelines and that they update their training assistance for summer escape and boarding rules to comply with new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some aircrafts to enhance the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the aircraft companies that have already submitted plans.
“In depending on the state of the plan, we could accept the extensive use of electronic devices very quickly,” said FAU.
The passengers now have to disable their phones, planners and other devices when the door is closed.
They should not restart them until the aircraft does not reach the height of 10 000 feet and the captain will not give a "bubble".
The passengers must disable their device again when the aircraft is low and do not include them until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, the aircraft whose aircraft aircraft is properly protected from electronic flights may allow passengers to use these devices during the flight, flights and rupture.
Most new aircrafts and other aircraft modified to enable passengers to use Wi-Fi in large heights, as expected, to meet these criteria.
Laura Gladying, President of the Group of Professional Borders Association, welcomed these changes.
“ As the new policy will be well-established (and we're going to work closely with the transporter to achieve this), it will be an unproduced option,” said Gladeing.
We were smelling to feel “schooled in school” when the case comes to this matter.
But the connection to the Cerfing Internet, the exchange of electronic letters, texts or downloads will still be prohibited by at least 10 000 feet higher, reported the Agency.
Passageers will be proposed to change their phones, planners and other devices in the aircraft mode.
Thus, no "Wolf with friends" is an intellectual Internet game in which Alex Boldin played on his phone in 2011 when we had been out of the aircraft from the American Airlines aircraft for rejecting the device when the aircraft was in the flight.
And more harder devices, such as notes, will continue to be put into the bathroom because they can hurt someone if they fly over the whole salon.
The mobile phone calls in the field will still be prohibited.
Regular telephone powers belong to the Federal Commission of Relationship, not FAU.
FAU may remove the prohibition of certain electronic devices during the flight and flight
In the last month, Mark Rasunder from the National Transport Security Council, the National Security Expert of CBS News, stated that hundreds of phones still were considered as a risk.
“The phones are really a problem, not only because they can make a place for navigation devices but we know through the SCF that they can create a shock for over a hundred connections when the air is in the air,” said Redner.
The Branch Advisory Committee established by the FAU to study this issue recommended in the last month that the Government authorize more use of personnel electronic devices.
In the past few years, pressure on FAO has been raised in order to reduce their use of limitations.
Critics, such as Senator democracy from Mrs. Clarke McKaskil, claim that there are no reasons for prohibition.
The observance of limitations is also more difficult to ensure, as the application of the device has become general.
Some studies show that passengers are forgotten or ignoring the indication of their devices.
FAU began to limit the use of electronic passengers in 1966 in response to the posts for navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to bring FM radio-accessors — high-technological instruments at that time.
New aircrafts are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations, but are also developed and supported by the FAU as sustained to electronic flights.
Abia Company has proposed passengers to use Wi-Fi at the Crescer height for a few years.
The wifi system is also more sustainable for the pools.
The majority of the shipping rays are available to larger use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Werta.
Today, electronic devices usually remove radio switchs as much lower than the previous generations of the device.
Electronic books, for example, are removed only the minimum signals when transferring the page.
But signals are more powerful when the device is loaded or sent data.
The Amazon.com company was among those who tried to raise the limitations for the use of electronic passengers.
In 2011, the representatives of the company loaded the entire aircraft of their devices to read the e-children books and flyed to check the problems that exist, but they did not find them.
Members of the Advisory Committee expressed disappointed feelings regarding whether the instrument is arising.
The Advocate Kidd from the National Aviation of Aviation Aviation said that it was considered to be real, even if the risk was minimumed.
Other members of the Committee said that only individual pilot communications were made to confirm that the device could establish places for aircraft systems, and most of these communications were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAO permits the pilots to disable the device during the installation at a limited visibility conditions.
The Group of Representatives of the Tourist Industry welcomed these changes by calling them a healthy step to meet passengers who now use many technological devices.
“We are glad that FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with security and protection,” said Roger Dou, Director-General of the United States Tourism Association.
Auto schools will be able to review the driving rights
The exams of driving rights will be able to take private companies with their own computer-based car.
This refers to the Government ' s draft decision 'to allow the management of vehicles'.
According to the newspaper, at present there are about 30 such vehicles in Russia.
The results of internal testing are expected to be taken to students of such "awarded" autonomy.
In that regard, the Hosato Inspection will conduct a monitoring of reviews each half of the year.
If there is a finding that over 30 per cent of theoretical reviews and more than 20 per cent of the students have not been given from the first time, this school will be free for a half year.
The technical requirements for automotives contained in the Government's draft decision shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The draft also contains requirements for training for the primary of two-cololated technology.
From 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners for the obtaining of rights of category A should provide a review in the conditions of urban movement.
In addition, from 5 May 2014 the company will not be able to work for foreign drivers with illegal rights.
Such employees should receive Russian rights after the examination.
A bird shipped by air in a safe place in the North Sea is returned to the beach of nature
The bird, switched at the beach after it was found in the state of the ocean in the North Sea, was returned to the beach of nature.
This water passenger was placed in the helicopter sent to Aberdin in the last month and then entered the Scotland Society for the Prevention of Common Training (SPCA) in the Savior Center in Alloa.
The manager of the Centre of Cole Seeddon said: “This is probably a water pasture, which is the winter of Northern Europe, which has slovened in the zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird was shocked and able to find a coffee shock.
He added: "He was not able to fly again, so they were called for us."
The water pasture was healthy and in a good condition until he was released.
Is Elita Europe ready to take business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the obligation to gather business representatives and to determine what changes the well-being and workplaces of Britain want to see in the EU.
To that end, we have stated the greatest and fullest survey of British business leaders, requesting them to express their thoughts about Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov's company asked more than 1000 business leaders representing a wide range of business in Britain on size, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the survey are not expected for many.
We have found that the majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities for the border of Europe by particular attention to countries that have modernization and growth, while the EU countries are in the West.
They wish that the Government gives a priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, not to have spent time for the debt and difficult reform of the EU institutions.
When they asked their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopolitical regulation to the Production Acts, most leaders believed that the control of these key components should be returned to Westminster.
There was a common single market injury, with business representatives claimed that the expenditure from Brussels is now transferred of advantages from the trade zone of Europe, and even 40 per cent of large enterprises, traditionally the most industrialized from all companies.
The last and most indicative is our business leaders' investigation showed that the clear majority of Britain wants to change the treaty and relations with the EU based on trade, not on policy.
This result, which has been observed among the enterprises of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business is a significant change that will return to Britain.
Higher rates: the achievement of the treaty changes and the more favourable conditions for Britain will ensure 16 per cent of the vote in order to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not have any doubt: this question shows that the British business supports its plan to revise the conditions of membership in the EU.
He also shows that business is expecting that the revision will lead to a significant increase in the current balance of force back to the side of Britain.
The best conditions for the British business are possible and are increasingly necessary while the euro enters into a closer economic and financial association.
The priority should be given to the workplace and economic growth in Britain, and, as our survey shows, this means a strong focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels regulatory activities.
The US Special Services listen to the personal phone of the Papy of Rome
Vatican’s activity is under the guard control of the American Special Services.
New documents from the Edward Snowden collection show that the U.S. investigation has conducted all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now the Papy of France is deeply opposed.

But the bloggers have already been actively abolished on memory banks.
After the presentation of the Olympic shop on October 30, they pointed out that the image of a banknote snow can be found in photos.

All of this has been the head of one of the largest animal companies of the country, President of the Russian Countries Council of Isak Sheps at the IIIth Annual Conference of the Institut Adam Smith, "Thura of the daily question in Russia," which just ended in Moscow.
It was discussed by the public market regulation.
From 2008 to 2012 the Russian bird market has already reduced 18 per cent, since in the last few years the country has seen a significant increase in the control of the animal sector in the production and trafficking of birds — small alcohol — reported to Sheps.
There is no world's severe limitation to the market of birds that are unpredictable to all new and non-logical bans that are based on the ways of combating alcohol abuse.
The drinker said that many legislative bans aimed at decreasing alcohol abuse did not have a particular impact, but all new initiatives were always made.
More than all of the animal producers have been shocked by the ban on sales of oxygen since this year.
"We have lost 35,000 consumers immediately," said Isaac Sheps.
Two predictions for the next year.
Optimist is the one that Shep said: Sell drinks are premature.
Psychiatically, there will be more 2-3 per cent.
In order to maintain their arrival, businessmen have to go from the shoes raised to the consumer in the "premium" class, which will be less slow, but it will stand on the road.
However, radicular consequences from the fall of sales are not visible to a small number of spys.

The workers who decided to take place in their own will were proposed a number of "solf parasites" in size.
For this reason, most of them left the workplaces in their own will.
However, Etmanov said that this number of people is the whole night change.
I don't think that's gonna be limited.
However, in the next two years, the authorities are not planned to take any programme for support of areas undertakings in difficult situations,” he explained that it does not take account of the stableness of production in the region and a large decrease in workplaces.
This information is not checked or confirmed in Ford.
We're waiting for the answer from the company, and when it comes, we're required to publish it.
Discussions on the reduction of workers in the Ford Enterprises have been in the Alliance for a long time.

The "Russian Mafia" in the United States finally strengthened the new name "Brath Circle"
A black list of Russian mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The United States Finance Ministry entered the Brat Circle, the three representatives of Russia, two Usbekistan and Israeli citizens.
One of the Russians was known as Gregory Leps, who suspected the transport of money for grouping members.
However, in the United States ' s black list, 22 people participated in the Broadquarter and six firmed organizations.
Many experts, however, are doubtful that such organization is real.
"Breat Circle" is an attempt to associate discrete criminal groups, "when said an expert on organized crime and professor of the University of New York Mark Galeothy.
He believes that the "Brath Circle" reflects the popular "Russian mafia".
"I have not met anybody in Russian law enforcement or anybody who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," quotes Mr. Galeothy, the American Centre for Corruption Research and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeothy agrees and Prof. George Mayson's University Liz Shelly.
"If they do, it is more like a criminal network, but not a organization," brings her words to the Centre for Research of Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of the past year, Mark Galeotti said that the Broad circle was united in the most closest Russian murder in the law of Assasan Usoyan, known as Dad Hasan.
The Criminal Authority was killed in January this year.
Similarly, Lashi Schushanashvili and Zacharia Kalashwa, filled out the list in 2012, were closely linked to Dad Hashan, and another part of the list, the Timuri Mirzov, was the Dad Hashana tribe.
Nevertheless, Mr. Galeotti notes that some personality and non-related relations with Usoyan.
It believes that all of them had better combined the general financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
One of the subjects was scanning an integration in the Brat Circle, Gregoria Leps, the favorite President of Russia, Wormira Putin, highlighted the attention of Kremell.
Of course, we consider that we will receive more detailed information from our American partners, as a result of this decision, why it was taken in such lists, said the secretary of the Dmitri Pesko State head.
In any case, he (Leps) is a civilian RF.
Like the interests of all RF citizens, his interests will be protected.
Alexy Miller's head says that the tuberculosis in Bulgaria is marked by the new era in the gas area.
The construction of the South River in Bulgaria is a launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the Head of Gazproma.
“The year was a marking event: the construction of the South River, the largest and most important project in Europe, began to be built by the Bolgar Gasproma,” said President Alexy Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key part of the energy security of the whole European continent.
The “South River” is intended to diffuse Russia's export routes through Europe.
The contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which is a large part of Russia's gas gas, increases the risk level for ordinary routes, says officials.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks related to transit countries were eliminated “forever”.
Bolgarian consumers will receive gas from the South River on a low price, just as the project will start working in 2015.
Gazprom stated that the construction should begin in other countries further on the road of gas towards the end of the year.
The annual project slowing capacity of the tube is 2,2 billion cubic feet.

Two officers of the MICA have been accused of sexual crimes before the accused of Jonathan Laurd, as known by the King's Commission
Two agents of MICA NSW were accused of sexual offences against children in 2011 against the Child Child Employees in Caringhan Lard, reported the Kingdom Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
However, the Commission was stated in an entry declaration that “he had never had cases of sexual violence against children within her organization.”
The Chief Executive Director Phillip Hair asked that the employee of MICA was accused of crimes related to child pornography, and otherwise when a sporting instructor in MICA Caringbah Hall was sentenced for sexual crimes against children under his visit in 1991.
Mr. Hayer said, Gail Fernes, a lawyer who provided assistance to the Commission that he knew about the first case, but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that ICOCA was also entitled to the Commission by claiming that “for external controls of the MICA, which recognized that ICOCA is in the first rows of child security.”
The evidence provided by the Commission indicated that the MICA had been notified that it had received the second from the end of the four possible quality reviews carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hair, who entered in the MICA when he was 21 years, acknowledged that he and the following leadership had allowed forecasts, launched Lord, and did not also have a clear understanding of the personnel of its obligations relating to communications on the violations of the security policy of children.
The Lord was sentenced for sexual crimes against 12 boys during two years of his work in MICA.
He was arrested as at least six years of prison.
But Mr. Hayer rejected the preference that the MICA corporate has stopped staffing to report on the violations of Lord in the area of child security.
The employees showed that they had observed violations, including that Lord was one of the children, who personally sweared them to the colleagues, said he loved one of them and allowed them to play his mobile phone.
Daniel Ockwell, who was under the Laurd leader and asked her to teach children's protection because she was concerned about his behavior, proved that Jackie Barnett, the manager of the MICA Office in Caringbach, was the leader of Lord, “as well a fearful and often difficult to be available”.
The Executive Director said he did not accept the explanation of staff that they had not been able to report the situation to his superior leaders.
In his words, their friendship with Lord led them from the thinking of the need to report to him.
Mr. Hair said he had presented the MICA of New South Wales his view that the lesson for the organization of the event with Jonathan Lord was not “information” from the staff and agreed with it.
Mr. Hair said that the decision to make staff signing a confidence agreement immediately after the detention of the accused was adopted by the Director-General of MICA on the Survey of the Children of Liam Whitly.
He said that it was intended to prevent the portion of evidence, but it was “resurrected” and that decision was wrong.
MYCA of New South Wales was not safe for children in their work at Jonathan Laurd during the 2009-2011 period, reported the Commission of Experts on the Development of Children Professor Steven Smolbon from the University of Greffit.
He said that they were “serial problems” at the collection, selection, instruction, staff education and control.

The specialist also noted that old failure was made by a series of driving games.
I'm so sorry that we couldn't win, Tmw words Alliery.
The team played a good shop, creates 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't leave Lacio.
The second Romans were attractive, but in general, I can't say that we lost concentration.
We had to run.

But our composition is good now.
Look at Qua who held a high-level meeting.
experts of the transportation activities in the Cardiff to fight for the call “Lois Year” knew that competition would be very high.
But nobody was ready to appear to a three-year-old Finton Kirkland.
Even not a schoolman, just just for a few months before his first steps, the small one with his chethful shooter, Tophi, has passed through three towers to take the main call, left by 30 adult partners away.
This unreparable couple — the same growth — has received high assessments for the external species, behavior and style of the annual competitor, which is the centre of Sannibenk’s final sport in Rari, near Cardiff.
When he went to the overall survey on the background of men and women in the exciting kitchens, he shocked his heads and the horror passed around the two-year-old Toffee.
The judges honored Fenton for his completely unexpected birth-based treatment of horses in the year.
Toffi received a higher assessment for the external nature and nature.
The fund gave to Tomfi his third birthday in March last year, and since then he worked with the Shetland scene every day.

The representative of this year's final exhibition said, “The Fund was only three years ago, but he knows how to treat his pool.”
However, they're a good team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffi for their external appearance and for their presentation at the show-ring.
They appreciate the vulnerability of the poet and manufacturer — Fronton and Tophi were the best on the market.
I'm sure that Fenton helped his attraction, he really looked well in his role.
Public appeal to the Chinese newspaper “The Reorganization must be”
The Chinese newspaper, published at the first point, calls for the release of an accused reporter, must be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The New Express newspaper in Guangoa made an unexpected public statement requesting a journalist Chan Youngjo.
Mr. Chan, however, later acknowledged on television that he had received the writing of false articles on company with the public share of property.
Now, the New Express should be “in full correction process”, as the regulator reports.
The Guanduan Management Command was ordered to correct the press and publications, radio, cinema and television.
Previous investigation showed that the member of Yangcheng Evening News Group, the New Express Group, published a number of false reports on the Zoomlion Rail company in the period from September 2012 to August 2013.
“The editing of New Express” was decontrolled,” states the regulator.
He states that it was decided to “invite a administrative appeal to Chan Youngjo to call for his reporter licence”.
He also recommended that the Yangcheng Evening News Group should correct the errors in the New Express and investigate the situations related to the newspapers and immediately amend the guideline of the New Express.
Mr. Chanje wrote a number of articles for the New Express, which stated that financial violations were undertaken by a construction equipment named Zoomlion.
After his detention was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release, claiming that it supports his journalist activity.
But Mr. Chan, then, appeared at the public television, acknowledging that he published false articles for money.
“ In that case, I lost the Zoomlion company, as well as all the news media industry and its ability to rely on public confidence,” said the public advertising company of CCTV.
I did this mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I understood my fault.
After the recognition of Mr. Chan the New Express, the apologics were published on the first field, said that the newspaper was not due to check its reports.
Recently, some high-speaked suspects have recognized television.
Experts say that the practice of elimination of recognition in China has continued to be distributed, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities to demand someone to self-contract.
U.S. tunnel - Mexico for the transfer of drugs equipped with its own iron road
One of the most complex tunnels is found for drug contracts between the United States and Mexico, which is covered by its own lighting systems, ventilations and electrical relves systems.
The United States authorities describe the tunnel of a width of four to three feet as one of the most complex secret steps ever found.
The tunnel, which consists of nearly six football fields, connects installations around the city of Tihuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
The area is filled with unacceptable components that facilitate the hiding of drug loads in the carriage.
The Tunnel was closed before any drug was immediately transferred through it, as stated by the authorities.
According to the judicial documents, the guards have confiscated eight and half tons of marihuana and 327 feet of cocaine in the discovery of the tunnel.
Treasury men, according to the law enforcement, were pronounced accused of marihuana and cocaine to disseminate.
In the case of condemnation, the terms of imprisonment of 10 years before the life of freedom are threatened.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, the contractors use wide underground channels.
Tunnel is the eighth large passage found in San Diego since 2006.
A number of larger tunnels have been found in Central Mexico after the assembly of marihuana in October, which made the drugs a complicated task to deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a length of about 700 meters of the rainy roads that flew from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tihuan to two sites of San Diego.

The British Police has the notification of expenditure
The British police today has reported to the WikiLeaks Julian Assanja founder, who was opened to the Ecuador Embassy in London and asked for rescue.
In Scotland and Yard, they claimed that the “official requirement” of an Australian 40-year-old, with the requirement to appear in the police office, adding that, in the case of non-fulfilment of this requirement, he would continue to be arrested.
Assanju threatens the extradition of Sweden in sexual offences after he exempted its possibilities in accordance with the British law when the Supreme Court rejected its appeal for extradition in that month.
When he was afraid that Stockholm was transferred to the United States, on June 19th he went to the Ecuador Embassy in London, asked in that South America country of political assistance.
Scotland and Yard “a 40-year-old man had the official requirement to be obliged to arrive in the police office day and time at our election,” reported the secretariat.
He continues to violate the conditions of release under the tax.
The U.S. refused to comment on police notifications.
Assanje is afraid that it will be extracted from Sweden in the United States to predict possible charges in the spy after the publication of more than 2500,000 American diplomatic debts against the secret of the WikiLeaks website.

Taxes for foreign owners will lead to the flow of the London Poster
The Chambership has implemented the preliminary assessment of capital growth tax measures, but expects the final decision by Mr. Osborn, which in the 2012 budget introduced the public post of 7 per cent for the household value of more than 2 million and annual payments for buyers who decided to possess houses in companion, not as physical persons.
At this time, the honourable residence in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which consists of 708 million feet in the financial year 2012/13, has already exceeded the overall amount in Northern Ireland, Wals, Scotia, Northwest, New Yorkshire and Hambera together.
Mr. Cook said: “After the increase in the households and the inclusion of the legislation related to the worship, it is very difficult to say that the integrity of the cost-related immobility is decreased independence on the impact of the existing municipal tax system.”
"But this step may lead to some foreign investors to purchase in movement in London or the present of its owners will not want to sell it", he added.
The value of primary non-motiveness, 5 to 10 per cent of the housing market, in the rich Southwest Pool of London, which is promising from Fulham to Wilbldon, has grown at 11,8 per cent in the past year.
According to the Savills company's research, prices in London have continued to demonstrate sustainable growth in 5,6 per cent in annual calculation, but have been actively developed by the “technological market” with the high prices in the south-west, north (7.4 per cent) and the city (6.5 per cent).
The scientists blew the light to how the dog moves are related to its vision.
More early studies showed that satisfactory dogs are shocked to the right side of the dog, while the pregnant dogs smell as well as the left side.
But now scientists say that other pseudophysician representatives may observe these thick differences in choosing and react on them.
Professor Georgeo Valluturgerar, a neurologist from the University of Trent, says: “It is well known that people with the left and the right of the brain participate in the formulation of constructors that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other kinds.
He added that the right dog of the brain controls the left side of the body and the contrary, and two half of them play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the diversity of other dogs, researchers observed animals when they looked at other dogs.
They measured the frequencies of animal hearts and analyzed their conduct.
Maybe we're already understood why their wounds sometimes move to one side, and sometimes to another.
Professor Valluturgar said: "We have shown dog videos with dogs, or naturalistic versions, or strength to remove from any other deceptive factors, and we could handle the movement of the cow and ship more left or right."
When the animals saw that there was nothing in the other way that was not expressed by the dog moved to the right (at the point of the sweet dog) they remained totally delighted.
But when they noticed that the skin was predominantly tempted to the left (once again from the point of the honey dog), their hearts were engaged and appeared to be shocked.
Prof. Valluturgerar said he didn't think dogs would have been communicated with each other with these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be worried and no.
He notes: “If there are some meetings with other dogs and often their snacks in one side are related to more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results may give the owners, veterinary and auditors more deeply understanding of the emotions of their animal.
The expert on the conduct of the dog John Bradshaw, a scientist invited to the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study to check whether the dog was important for the left and the right of the dog.
In the past year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs strike the head to the left if they look at an aggressive dog and right if they look at a satisfactory dog.
And in another scientific work at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “It was more often approached to the dog, when it was sent to the left and not right instead of being shocked, the opposite behavior of Italian research.”
He said that differentity could be because dogs in various studies did not completely accept animals in films or dogs as dogs.
It might be useful to investigate how dogs react to the dogs, he explained.
“ While there are sufficient evidence that two ears of the brain are used for various purposes, ” he said.
However, taking into account the easierness that they may be registered, we may already understand why their skins sometimes be sent to one side, and sometimes to another.

Pope Francis's first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will first enter the new Catholic Church in the sanctuary for its service on 22 February, as stated in the Vatican Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic church after the pope, and they choose the pope, so France will appoint their first group of people who will eventually participate in the election of his priest.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, after the cardinal of the 80-year-old, he cannot participate in the elections of the pope is the predicting group of 120 “cardinalists”.
In announcing this news, the Vienna-Secretary Press, the father of Fedric Lombardi, said that before the sanctuary, all the present cardinals, known as constitution, would be held in the congregation.
“Papa Frances decided to report on his decision to contact the consortium in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with kardinals from different parts of the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero from the Catatolic voice organization said that in February the number of cardinal electors would probably be decreased.
He said that the pope usually calls so much cardinals as necessary to reaffirm the number of cardinals to 120, as well as the cardinal age of 80 years as he wanted.
The consideration will be important in the next year, since it will be the first from the date of the French election in March this year, according to the Valero's words.
At this time there is a kind of pre-accession for Europe and especially for Italy.
“It is interesting to see whether the new Pape of Cardinal from other parts of the world is to restore the balance,” he stated.
In South America, 40 per cent of Catholics are lived, but few cardinals are presented.
This will also be the first chosen cardinals since the French Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from the world, which was mandated to search for ways to reform churches.
In the past, Dad decided all of it.
“ At the time, Francis chose eight cardinals to help him, ” said Valero.
He said that "wise possible" that Francis would be addressed to the cardinals for the advice.
But we weren't in that situation before it -- it's all for us first.

Obama's elector ' s cry
I voted for President Obama two times, sharing hopes for changes
He said that Obama had allowed the structuringism of the Republicans to make no relief efforts.
Restructuring cannot be resolved by the Web site reformed by the Health System, the attacks of impilots
The 2008 Obama campaign Memories are the painful memories that might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second student of the Harvard University Medical School.
I'm reading a terrible painful book in these days.
I thought that this book would encourage me during the second course of the Medical Faculty and restore hope in me.
It is called “Dersity for Victory” and it is the Memories of the President-Chairman's 2008 campaign.
When I finish the reports on my patients and lie in my bed, this book returns to me while the policy inspired millions of people and the statements could be able to shut up the spirit.
The benefit of elections was shocked, and the leading news programmes made a pause to understand that historical moment.
My colleagues cryed from joy, and my parents took all the newspapers they could only find.
The White House had to come to the young team of the streets, and the people were ready to change.
In 2008, the support level of Obama was 82 per cent.
Then I'll close the book.
Returns now represents a deep trial as a restraint from the dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism — they say a further reminder, the painful memories of the launched opportunities.
Over the years since I left my first election bureau, the changes have really been changed.
That was what I couldn't even imagine.
I will give Obama a position for its great and variety of achievements, from the adoption of the Act on Accessing Medical Assistance to the conclusion of our military in Iraq, the amendment of the Rule “Don't ask, don't say”, the murder of Usama Ben Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that the partial restructuringism has blocked too many attempts to advance our country: immigration reform, the choice of public health and the closure of the basis in Guantanamo among others.
But after a countless number of times, when I was on the side of the Ombudsman's administration, defending it against colleagues and colleagues, I have finished the explanations I could give.
I reached the political disappointment.
The Republicators cannot explain the permission to hear foreign leaders or the slaughter of innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the private life of Americans of the National Security Agency or the persecution of deployers who discovered injuries by the Government.
He cannot explain the murder of an American citizen Anvar al-Aulaki without courts and consequences or non-observation of public funding and expenditure during the presidency campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which states that the White House's efforts to silence the media are “agressive... from Nixon’s administration.”
In recent times, he cannot justify what is not possible to develop a simple web site over three years after signing the access to medical assistance.
I don't know if I had to wait.
Should I understood 18 years of age that the leadership could oppose political campaigns before him?
It is obvious that the work of the selected post is not a predicted programme of action, since our public dialogue will be formed by the opposition of the political party and the evental meetings as the illness in Newtown.
However, all the above-mentioned examples show that they were a major choice of the Administration.
And that's what I'm worried about.
I have again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I have been enthusiasm on his candidate.
Mr. Romney was an unreasonable and strict alternative that he was not able to make decisions on his own policies or views.
I thought that in my second term, by free of the pressure of future elections, Obama justifys the hopes we have heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating was below 45 per cent in this week, it was more difficult to return in 2008.
This makes me touch in many promises that have flewn away.
In this week, I read a part of the book described how Clinton made Obama a sensible view on primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At the analysis meeting, he told his officers that they should return to the normal rule and remain faithful to their goals.
“ I want us to return our appreciation, ” he said.
"We must remember who we are."
Five years ago, Mr. President, and I agree with you.
The comments expressed in this opinion belong to Nathaniel Morris exclusively.

RBS excludes two monetary trainers
The Kingdom Bank temporaryly excluded the work of two trainers in its currency operations, according to the information of two persons known to this situation, that is another confirmation that the overall control of regulators of monetary market manuals is strictly collecting trafficking.
Some of the largest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in investigations related to the largest financial market in the world, a daily trading of $5.3 billion.
These two trainers will be the first RBS staff that have been deployed during the deployed investigation, which is called on the scanner related to the LIBOR interbank rate.
In refusal of commenting, the bank reaffirmed that in this month he received requests for information from the regulatory bodies.
“ Our current investigation continues, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and with other regulators,” reported in the bank two weeks ago.
In the last month, the informed persons said that RBS had transmitted e-mail records and mingle communications that received and sent him to the former tremendour, regulated by the Great Britain, the Financial Control Office (FCA).
This trainer, Richard Asher, left out of RBS in 2010 and, as he knows, provides a departure to his current post of the European Common Trade Director in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the Chief of European Social Trade in Citi, left a department in this week, while Matt Hardinner, an ex-more monetary trainer in Barclays and UBS, was removed from the work of the Standard Chartered bank on that week.
No of these trainers was accused of any violations.
Mr. Asher's contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citi Group, on the words of informed persons.
The UBS Bank reported this week that he had taken measures against some of his staff after the Swiss regulator Finma said that he would investigate the claimed manipulation on the monetary market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six world regulatory bodies — the European Commission, Finland, the Switzerlandn Antimonopolic Authority, the FCA, the United States Justice Ministry and the Valuable Office of Hong Kong — are considering the appeal that the bankers have entered a conspiration to the monetary market.
HSBC, Citi Group, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal checks or received requests for information from the regulatory bodies, said that persons were familiar with the situation.
The banks have recorded mingled communications and electronic letters for a few years in the search for crimes.
The checking news has increased tremendous activities in the past years, one of the largest sources of commercial investment banks income, which, however, had faced difficulties because the low balance of currencies decreased the benefits of buyers.
Some bankingers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation, saying that the wide and high-level currency market was almost impossible to manipulate, but the senior trainers said that it was not always true.
According to the older trigger, despite a large number of daily trade on the currency market, the liquidity fraction between different trade platforms and the more wide use of their internal platforms means that " you can start to make the market influence for a very small price".
This news came on the same day when the credit Suisse bank declared that one of the trainers of London's Fund Trade Trade Division was released this week after the loss of almost $6 million at the end of the last year.
The bank has immediately notified the relevant bodies and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are sure that the trainer has acted alone and that this issue was able to localize,” reported Kredit Suisse.

In Egypt, the first President is elected freely
Mohammed Mursey accepts a judge, but the day of his complaint is not marking the end of the political fight in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Murcy promised the “new Egypt ” when he offered a sentence, became the first elected President of the country, changed Hosney Mubarak, who was denied 16 months ago.
In its inauguration before the Supreme Constitution Court, Murcy also became the first elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth Head of the Egyptian State after a monarchy over 60 years ago.
He took a sentence before 18 courts in black mantieths in the neighborhood of Nila, built in the style of the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are trying towards the best future, new Egypt and the second Republic,” said Murcy during the Training Ceremony shown in direct ether on public television.
“The seventy-year-old Egyptian people have put the foundation of a new life, the absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Murcy, a 60-year-old engineer with American education from the Bretiv-Musulman, the fundamentalist group, who was a large part of the 84 years of its existence prohibited by a museum for the cruel action of the other governments.
The building was guarded hundreds of soldiers and police, when Murcy arrived with a small cortex soon after 11 a.m. to local time.
Only hundreds of persons gathered in the court building to welcome the new President, and, unlike the presidential park during the Mubarak, the movement was stopped just a short time to leave the car rental for a normally living road connected to the city centre with the Southern Refugees.
Although Mursei was expressed as an unharistic "safe" wheel, his personal prestige grows slowly from the moment of his victory and the fifth statement he tried to imagine himself not only as Islamic candidates but also all those who want to prove to the end of 2011 resurrection against the Authority Mubarak.
“The Year of Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Murcy, who was obtained in the blue of the business shooting with the red gallery, judges in the slaughter of the tree panels where he has accepted a sentence.
Afterward, Murcy went to the University of Kalifornia where he had to do his inauguration.
He was given an official receipt with the armed orchester who performed the public jinn during which he was “movely”.
The military department was presented by Hussein Tantavi.
His visit was met by the Army and the people, one hand, which scanned hundreds of meetings in the main university literature hall.
Based in 1908 as an outlet of light education, the University of Kalifornies became the opponent of Islamic Study Groups in the 1970s.
Murcy adopted a symbolic sentence on Thursday area of Tahrir, where the resurrection of the Museoric Authority rule last year, and promised to return the authority of the President whose office was reserved by the military council to take the cases of the refusal leader.
But accepting an official judgment before the court, not before the parliament, he does the will of the military, and it is knowing that the fight against authority will continue.
Murcy's talk on Tahrir's area was filled with theatrical polytic helmets.
A periodic meeting of the Tomé Builders Association was held on the basis of the Yalutor Car Industry.
In the context of the event, the new line for the production of electronic tube began.
According to the commercial director of Dennis Gribanon, in 2011, a marketing survey of the market in the Tunisia was conducted with the new ownership.
It was found that the region requires more than 500,000 tons of electrical tube per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile and its installations for their production.
More than 7,000 tons of production have been downloaded this year.
Investment was more than 120 million rubbers,” said Dennis Gribano.
In October, a new state that allows to increase assortment.
The manufacture is launched as a small tube profile that is used for swimming households, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, as well as the largest for the building sector.
Plan to go to the production level of 500,000 tonnes per year, with approximately 10 per cent of its consumption in Tunisia.
In spite of the other terms of transition, the number of undertaking staff has not been decreased - it now represents 157 persons, in order to purchase new equipment - more than 50 employees.
The company is being prepared for carriage, and the necessary specialists are collected from the existing.
In the future year, a new agregate of the proliferation has become total to five miles [5 millimeters], which allows to reduce the autonomy of the production, as well as another condition, with a speed of the tube to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, enterprises will be able to release the tube that are used in the housing and the community.
The Enterprises ' s task is to close to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tunisia area in this product.
The Vice-Chairman of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Islands, calling on the manufacture leaders, recommended greater attention to modernization of machinery companies.
This aims and forms of public support for industry, including the reimbursement of the percentage credit rates for the purchase of new equipment and its liquidation costs.
In this year, 150 million rubbers are intended to be allocated to these purposes, two thirds have already been lost.
The last Commission, which will consider the subsidy treaties, takes documents from undertakings until 15 November.
Furthermore, the budget is reimbursed to participate local producers in the international burdens.
The budget for the next year is estimated to be a total of 150 million rubbers, which can be used to compensate liquidation payments and credits for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the wearmarks, 3 million to the energy savings programme.
The reimbursement of assigned and paid equipment produced in the south of the Tunisia area for the oil complex is reduced to 72 million.
According to Leonida Ostroumvu, this form of support will be stopped, since it was the motivation of paying taxes to benefits of coppers who paid the oil companies in the area budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies are the direct cost obligations of the region.
In this regard, the Government considers the immediate support of industrial enterprises, not the financing of the oil sector.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented for production.
Many firm leaders expressed concern about the situation in the oil relations.
The provision of their purchased equipment is the competitive advantage of the Southern Tunisia industry, and it will be difficult to be recovered by the average Russian pool, where the more delicate workforce is.
Furthermore, the new owner of TNK-VD is Rosneth company that has not yet been able to place its orders to Tuman businesses.
The Ukrainian Project Agreement is completed in 2013, and the applications for its extension have not been made.
At present, the undertaking of the Southern regions specialized for the oil sector can not form a order portal for the future year.
The question remains that the taxes from the oil budget in the Uwa region will be made to the region or they will be paid on the location of the new ownership.

Azarus promised the Ukrainians to pay the prices of goods after the signing of the association with Euro-Water
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nicolai Azarus, believes that the prices in the country are significantly decreased after the signing of the Association Agreement with the European Union.
In this regard, he declared his readers on Facebook.
It can be said that the prices are defined by a large number of factors, including the customs and the customs payments.
Thus, after signing the agreement and entry into force of the Free Trade Zone, the customs import imports levels of the EU are significantly decreased.
And that would mean that the prices must be lowered.
"It is about the goods made from the EU," wrote Azarus.
With regard to other goods, the impact of the price agreement will not be so direct, it will be redispensed.
However, there should not be a higher price.
Thus, the billboard messages that recently appeared sufficiently in our country that the EU's association is the growth of prices, that's not exactly that, or if exactly, it's not true," resumed Azarus.

After the accused of the urgence of the Vatilia, it was condemned
Vasileva's evolution, whose almost a year has been given an accurate attention to the media, has not yet commented several publications in the press as well as in Minoboron as in personal relationships with the Minister of Defence with Anatolym Serdouk, its poesia and the privacy of valuable matters.
However, 1 November, the "Oboronzeris" case violated silence.
In the interview, Life News Vasiliev said, "It is, of course, that it was a real task: to remove any negative information on the former Minister of Defense from me. "
It was the load that I had to give a show, or they're gonna put me in prison.
To this day, these threats have been stopped.
We're going to the court, we're gonna prove our innocence.
We are sure of 100% in the winning.
In this way, you can conclude that, for the most time, Vasilvi's word is that it is not interested in smiling.
The statement of the official representative of CK RF Würmir Markin was likely to have found details in the collection of the images collected by the Officers' case.
Among the arrested property, there is a number of pictures that the master, being confident in his deep knowledge of art, acquired as the chief of the world's livestock.
However, the artistic expert, designated by researchers after the arrest of these pictures, established that they had no art value and, simply, are deep details," said Markin at the beginning of October.
Some pictures stolen by the Ministry of Defense...
Then, they admitted that they were not stolen from the Minoboron, and they said that I was bad with a sweet.
Who has the right to discuss my legs, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it's just unlimited," says Vasilieva.
In this regard, whether it recognises its fault in one of her 12 criminal episodes, Vatilia said, " Of course not.
Remember nothing.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation.
They're just bringing the people into a mistake, that's all.
Furthermore, in response to the current statement of the CCC, that Vasileva was able to investigate criminal matters, the lawyer said that he and his customer "is not to know the matter."
What was the reason for the proclamation of Vasilia’s home arrest, which was still not communicated with the press?
Maybe how was she not able to respond to the accused of bad punishment?
Or is the right of the journalists "Commsholki", who claimed a couple of days ago, that she "slaughtered in a larger transmission under the home arrest" because of the reconciliation of Anatolia Serbuki with his wife and his return to his family?
The famous military conspirator Victor Balanz in his article "Search has returned to the wife?" wrote: "The slavers do not exclude that after such a struggle, they may become more talking about questions."
Previously, Vasilva had some accused of the illicit sale of the unmovable property of the Minoboron.

In the past year, the Minister of Education, Michael Gouv, said that it was “a broad consensus that we have to reform our review system to reverse public confidence”, stated that school exams would be“ more complex, more ambitious and more strict.”
Research shows that English schools have less time for mathematicity (116 hours per year, or three hours per week in four, than in most countries.
For comparison, the Australian schools give a medium of 143 hours per year, and in Singapore about 138 hours.
Although the formal requirement to provide more time in the mathematics, the sources in coalition said that the extensive schools of mathematics in combination with the higher coefficient in the rating table would be used to provide additional education for the subject.
The training plan will be more attentioned to the “real life debts”, including the financial mathematics.

Dmitri Meddev: The growth rate of GDP RF is insufficient for State development
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev considers that it is not sufficient for RF to increase its GDP and that the situation can be improved, facilitating business credit conditions and changed the Russian economy structure, in innovation, reports Reuters.
In this year, we planned GDP growth in the area of 3 per cent, perhaps even more.
Really, it will be less than 2%.
In the background of the recession in a number of European countries, it would not be very bad, but it is little for us, because the economic basis is not as strong as in general a number of countries and, in order to develop, must be higher.
It is now very important that Russian companies receive normal price credits are the first thing that must be done,” stressed the head of the Government.

Travel through strikes, rivers and jungles to provide free medical assistance
Dr. Jorge Bwelle provides free medical assistance in rural areas in Cameroun
Bwelle and his team are conducting almost every week, taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country, the doctors aren't so much - only one per 5000
Call here or through your mobile device.
Dr. Jorge Bwelle is one of the 10 main heroes of CNN 2013.
You can pronounce for him or any other 10 main heroes to become the CNN Heroes.
This person will receive $2,50,000 to continue its expenditure work.
During 21 years, Jorge Bwelle saw his father returning to life and again in an inconscious state, shooting through hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was blessed in a car accident in 1981 near Yaunde, Kamerun capital.
First, he was only cut off his hand, but the infection was spread to the brain and called a gematic that recalled himself before the end of his life.
“ There were no neurochirurgs in Cameroon, ” said Jorge Bwelle.
If we had money, we would take him out of Cameroon.
Instead of that, the Bwell has given his father in overcome clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could have received.
“ It’s not easy, ” says Bwelle.
- You can go from home at 5 o'clock, get to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
It's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation was not very changed since the father of Bwelle ended in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor in Cameroon was 5000.
For comparison, the proportion in the United States is a doctor of 413.
And even if the cameras could call to the doctor, many of them wouldn't be in the carman.
Two of the five people in this country live in the outstanding poverty, and almost three four health costs are private.
“ The only problem of them is poverty, ” said Bwelle.
And because of the poor, they cannot enjoy their life.
I saw his father's suffering and many of his partners, Bwelle had decided to do something.
Last year, Dr. Jorge Bwell and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works with a co-conciliator surgery in the Headquarter of Yaunded Hospital.
He also found the non-commercial organization of ASCOVIME, which organizes travel travels to the agricultural field for free medical assistance.
Since 2008, he and his voluntary group had been assisted by almost 32.000 people.
Once every Thursday, he and 30 people are killed in the shooting, lifting medical ownerships and traveling to visit the people who need to help the village.
It's not always a chance to conscious them.
Sometimes they had to cut the machines through the river and the hills.
But when they come, they meet as true heroes, it is a celebration of songs and dances and the best places that can only offer local people.
The cost of medical services in these villages is really a matter of celebration, and Bwelle with its wide smiling and unlimited energy more than happily joining.
The next morning, the brigade begins to take hundreds of patients.
“ We take 500 people on each trip, ” said Bwelle.
They come with the whole surrounding in the radius 60 miles [60 km] from the village, and they're swimming.
Each of these clinics offers various medical services.
Many have been treated from malaria, tuberculosis, injury, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmissible diseases.
Others may receive cups, shoes offered or free birth testimony — documents required for schools that many poor families simply can not allow themselves.
On the night of the brigade, simple operations are carried out under local anesthesis.
Operations are generally carried out in the school building, municipality or house; after the procedure, patients are up and go to the post-operation area to release the place for the next man.
Using the operating and sanitary manufacture generators, Bwelle and his volunteers are working until Sunday morning.
This is an unfortunate time, but the integrity of the brigade is usually helping tree musicians.
“ They shoot all night in the barbaron so that we should be guarded and continue to work, ” said Bwelle.
On Sunday, the members of the Brigadier return to the shocked but proud of their work.
The group, which was from the Cambodia Doctors and foreign students, conducted 700 free operations for the past year, and knows that their assistance could have a great importance for those who are helping them.
One person explained that it was possible to work again.
“ This will change the future for me and my family, ” said a man.
In addition to these clinical receipts in the weekly and work in the hospital, Bwelle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaounded.
That is the second work, in his words, provides financing for 60 per cent of its non-profit organization; other resources are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Kathy O'Melly, a medical student of the second course at the Philadelphia University, volunteer in the Bwelle Group.
He is always in the hospital or is trying to pay money for the organization to continue these campaigns.
For future physicians and nurse, such as O'Melly who came from the United States and Europe to join Bwelle in carrying out his task, is an opportunity to practice that they would never have received home.
“We got the opportunity to assist on operations where we helped to remove the blood or keep the tools for Dr. Bwelle, ” said O'Melly.
If you were an academic student, you would never have received such a possibility in America.
The voluntary students usually pay their travel to Cameroon, often with gifted medicines.
But when they arrived in Yaoundda, their food, transport and education pays Bwelle.
"He's a hero, without doubt," said O'Melly.
He gives his lives to this organization, and his desire to help Cameroon people.
For Bwelle, nearly the continuous loading of work is not a hard test.
Helping a happy life of others to fulfill the promise of his father is what brings him great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this job, ” said Bwelle.
- And I think of my father.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to people smile to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can help.

The duration is rejected from its words of health
Among the crystics, President Obama last night came to the appointment of your often renewed, a unique promise that “if you like your medical insurance plan, you can keep it.”
For hundreds of thousands of people have been informed of the stopping of service from their conductors, the Republicns recently discovered the President because he introduces the American society in a mistake.
Last night, Obama submitted a few of its public promises.
“The majority of the health insurance who works may keep it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
In view of the fact that he was called “new use” for the stopping of service, Obama called for the Americans to search for other market options.
Most people will have the possibility of obtaining the best, integrated medical insurance plans at the same price or even deterioration of the provision.
“ You will get better conditions, ” he said.
The Administration stated that nobody should surprise that 5 per cent of the people who purchase insurance could be made to change the plans because their claims did not comply with new standards required in accordance with the access to medical assistance law.
“ Let me say directly to these Americans, that you will benefit better,” said Siberius in the statement before the Committee on Energy and Trade of the House of Representatives in Washington.

The Rosbalt Agency has lost the status of the media for an inestimable burden
On October 31, Moscow decided to recognise the invalid license on the registration of the Rosbalt Agency, writes the Lent.
In the absence of the Media Statute, Roka Navigation has established a systematic and cruel violation of the media law.
During the process, an unpleasant precedence was established: the Court had read the possible closure of the media, which actually rejected the publication in the right to issue contracts.
What's "Rosbalt"?
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the Agency opened the second main office in Moscow and a number of regional offices.
Agencys also work as representatives in the former SPD countries.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as Federal Information and Analytical Agency.
In the mid-2000 Agency was the list of the most known private media online in Russia.
The " Rosbalt " has always been very specifically low: the nuclear of exceptional publications of the Agency (and still constituted) marks with the sources of the law enforcement bodies.
The discussions on the closeness of publications to force structures continued to be held throughout the existance of the Agency.
On the other hand, Rosbalt had a wide source base in various states, in favour of such provisions, and was said in the chapter of the project, that Nathania Chaplin was a wife of Victor Chrésima.
The Chapter's role is not clear until the end is: mostly it is called the project printer.
The Director-General of the Agency is Laris Afonina, the main editor of Nicola Williams.
Recently, Rosbalt has not been launched in federal media racings - nor quote, nor by hearing.
In October, the Agency took the 25th place to visit Russian media websites via Live Internet.
At the same time, LiveInternet, the mediated rosbalt.ru website audit, is about 1500,000 unique visitors (and up to 500 000 reviews), monthly around three million unique visitors.
In addition to the most popular materials in the past five months - notes on the incapacity of Cromela in Ukraine, the death of the Kroal and Shot Group, in the capital Brazil.
The Rosbalt Conflict began in July 2013 when the media amendments were prohibited by journalists for non-valorizing burning.
Weeding has found the prohibited lyrics in two posted video agencys on the website "Jigit from Rosnodar" and "Pussy Riot disabled oil extracts".
The further parts are different.
The Rosbalt, on the basis of the detected videomateries, accused Rosbalt in a cruel and systematic violation of the media law and requested the court to choose the license office.
The Rosbalte state claimed that the claims of the State were unrighteous: first, the roles were not editing materials, second, maternal words were marked, and, thirdly, the role was removed from the site after warning.
The representatives of the Agency were pleasing for the Royal Surveillance Chambers in the World Court, and the Moskow Court took the search for Royal Surveillance on October 22, 2013, and the consideration of these complaints continued.
However, the 25 numbers of world courts have already decided not to use Rosbalt: the main editor of Nicola William has recognized the guilty of the Administrative Criminal Crimes Code and has been expelled for 200,000 rule - 100,000 for each role.
Obviously this was also predicted by the Moscow ' s hearing -- if it was rejected by the idea that the exit could be predicted before.
31 October the Court decided to acknowledge the invalid witness for the registration of the Rosbalt, which actually removed the media status agency.
It is not possible to say that Rosbalt remained alone during this opposition.
The Agency supported the Chairpersons of Gosmith (the statement on behalf of the Chief of Alexander Jarow, on 10 October, was signed by 26 deputés; the same document was issued on the initiative of the CRF).
The unlawfulness of the closure was declared by the Head of Russian journalists, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists Paul Husus and the President of the President of the Human Rights Council Mikhail Fedotos.
Furthermore, according to Goddan, the Royal Surveillance Guide has even provided to him any guarantee that the license would not be reached before the license was resigned.
The Court on "Rosbalt" showed that, under which laws are more safely available in Russia today, a major issue.
Syria has destroyed the carriage equipment
Syria has destroyed all the declared powers for the production of chemical weapons and recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
The first stage of the disarmament has finished the day before the deadline.
Before 1 November, Syria should be destroyed production and other subsidiary instruments intended for the preparation of slaughter-qualified substances.
The destruction of the stocks of similar substances or its chemical components should be completed in the midst of 2014.
According to the representative of the OHCHR, there are currently similar substances in printed stocks.
International inspectors were sent to Syria after more than 1400 people died in Damasco on 21 August during the chemical attack.
The main task of the inspectors was not to lose time - so that Syrian authorities could not make more chemicals - and destroy the infrastructure to interact chemicals and munitions.
These productive powers will now be carefully observed so that they do not allow them.
The next century, in the midst of November, the OHCHR and the Syrians must agree to the detailed destruction plan for already existing materials.
A lot of questions here.
Where will they destroy?
Who provides this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be fully checked by western officers.
They will be willing to recommend to the inspectors new instruments to check if they are reasonable to suspect that Damask is not opened before the end.
The U.S. believes that the shooting was carried out by regular armies.
Syria and Russia argued that this is the case of Syrian rebellion.
The world community was required from the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached by Russia through, to destroy or bring all powerful powers for the production of gas and heat and to fulfil the equipment of these substances.
Now, when this stage comes, the next step should be the destruction already in the Syrian armed army.
It is suggested that the arsenal may be more than 1000 tons of nervous and parallel substances, every nervous gas and other prohibited chemical substances covered in several decades of different places.
For its destruction, the OHCHR and the Syrian authorities have to start agreed with the graph of action - two weeks.
The field leader of OHCHO Gerry Smith stated that his inspectors were "normally observed for the destruction of the equipment".
"They are now not able to make further production or discharge of chemical weapons, " he said.
The OHCHR states that the inspectors visited 21 of 23 objects in Syria and convinced that equipment and similar substances were destroyed or inconsistent.
The remaining two installations are too dangerous to carry out the inspection in the document, but the equipment was transferred and checked by OSC specialists.
According to Smith, the destruction of the infrastructure of oxygen was particularly unlike, as it worked in the continuing conflict.
At the beginning of October, the Nobel World Premier received, but, as Smith said, the time to redistribute it to the inspectors until there was not found, they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented recognition that the US spy “is gone far away”
John Kerry demonstrated the reducing of the tactics of the United States defence programs and recognized that, in some cases, the U.S. spy “is gone far away”.
The secretariat also acknowledged that, along with Barack Obama, it was “in the car drive” during the exhibition of the slightly disbursements of Edward Snowden about the Spionship ANB.
The information losses made the Government of the United States in the centre of the diplomatic scandale with their unions.
Mr. Kerry said on videolines at the open Government conference in London: “It is not doubtful that the President and I, as well as other Government members have actually taken some of the situations on the car pilot, because this is already existing, and during the Second World War, and in the very difficult years of war, and of the 11 September.”
He then became the first member of the United States high-employed Government, acknowledging that the U.S. Spionship was too far, but stressed that no rights were violated.
He said: “In some cases, it was unpleasantly far away.
And the President has decided to shut the light on this issue and explain to the people, and now has a careful analysis for no abuse.
I believe in you, the wrongdoers of the unbelievers are not in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the ANB had worked out of good dealings and that his surgery operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in the new world where people are ready to be shocked.
There is a radical extremism in the world, an unreasonable and full determination to kill people, to kick people and to attack Governments.
And if you were able to overlook it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented the violations of aircrafts, the explosions and the murder of people because we could know about these plans."
Among the subject, American lawyers are sent to Europe to help address questions related to the United States shooting spy and to convince Europeans in the need to continue joint anti-terrorism events with the United States, said the Chairman of the Senate on European Affairs on Friday.
The Senator of the Connective State, Chris Merfi, said that it was unrelated with members of the European Parliament and other persons in this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of disappointment in relation to the National Security Agency.
“In the interests of the United States national security, it is really important that Europeans remain our partners with regard to our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said the Democracy, who works for the first time and as a Chairman of the International Senate on European Affairs, at Washington interview.
- I go to Europe to understand that we must continue to cooperate in the field of combating terrorism, despite their angry with these ANB programmes."
News that ANB had collected millions of telephone talk records in Europe, have deteriored the relationship with some United States partners, although the head of the Agency stated that they were uncertain and reflected the uncertainness of metal data collected by NATO and shared with the United States.
Other disbursements were reported by Snowden, which showed that ANB had implemented the mobile phone monitoring of the officer of Germany Angela Merckel, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper protected the spiriting activities against the unions as necessary and said that it was a common case with both sides.
On the basis of this smile, Murphy said that his office organizes a trip of members of the Congress, which is expected that this year would be, and he hoped that the delegation would enter both parties and the two rooms.
The names of other participating lawyers should be heard in the nearby days.
He said, the travel program is still at the stage of development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of traveling is to improve relationships, he said that some of the “frequencies of the best convictions” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in which spy programs themselves were used for many years.
“When we can change our postponent programmes to better protect European rights, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only ones who are doing discernmental activities,” said Murphy.
Mr. Carry should be sent to those weekends in the Middle East and in Poland to address the problems of enemy with the United States Strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the disclosure activities of the United States.
The new compositions of the public observing committees increased the impact of prisoners
Today the Council of the General Palestine (OHP) may adopt new compositions of the public observing committees in 43 Russian regions.
If a vote is adopted, the troops will increase their influence.
NGOs are public structures that control the conditions of freedom of imprisonment.
The case of Sergey of Magnita and Leonida Distribuiev, copy-collection concerns, that is, through the UNC, most of the resonance events.
The UNHCR control is the fight between the human rights defenders and the forces lobbyists.
At the meeting of the OOP Working Group on the Formation, I proposed to make a criteria for choosing the experience of human rights activities.
"He didn't accept and formed the lists, but did not develop criteria," says Valerie Bourjev.
Borew is the present Chairman of the Moscow Observatory Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the Alliance of the Alliance of the Rights Protectors of Criminal Affairs.
In the event of Mr. Gosmith, he developed a law which regulates UNHCR activities.
The OOP Council should vote for UNHCR composition in 43 countries.
At 1800 vaccines, less than thousands of desires have been claimed, and the competitors were not able to organize because of the lack of candidates.
The OOP promises to organize a donation on vacuum locations.
OCN Moscow is one of the few committees with competitiveness, despite the new composition of 20 parties.
According to Bourneva, the current composition of the capital Commission of 11 defenders and 9 forces, and the variation that is on the vote in the OOP is changed to 17 to 23.
In that regard, 30 human rights defenders were requested in the capital Commission.
The new composition can reiterate the representative of God's Brotherhood Vicheslav Callin.
He was a member of the United Nations for three years, but never visited prisoners.
Borgeist believes that, by appointing his Chairman of the UNHCR, they will be able to make the work of the human rights defenders unexcepted, so the human rights defenders do not exclude collectively from the Commission.
They believe that the movement of forces is coordinated by UNN.N.C. Anton Colocks, launching the Russian Officers, is an organization that remains the interests of the force states.
"I'm not the girls in the trunk," RBK said daily Anton flowers.
He refuses that the prosecution of any lists and said that it is not intended to prevent human rights defenders to visit arrested opposers.
He had not even been interested in which list of votes were now voted in the OS.
The publication of Bore Information is considered a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planning change of the leadership of the Chilebian ONG.
Her former leaders are dismissed from the last year's copy worries.
The General Hall concluded that the leadership of the local committee had ignored the problems of prisoners.
And here, the UNO of Rostova-na-Dona can go from human rights defenders to the forces.
From the new lists "slaughter" the local Chairman of the Chairman of the Chairman of the Commission, there was a of his opposers, despite the Federal Public Hall excluding him in May 2013.
The letters of the Moscow and Growth Commission Borjeva are considered as a "coupeck".
The repayment of the Tolokonian hope did not affect the UNO of Mordovia, which is considered a "weapon", which was a new composition, and only one human rights defender had not even adopted documents for competitives.
Member of the OOP Nicolai Swanidze told RBK daily that he had voted against the proposed list, as it was in the situation in Moscow and Rostove-na-don.
In his position, he dismissed other members of the Council.
His colleague on OP Paul Huss said that he voted for as he liked the proposed Moscow list.
He coordinated the listing of UNO Vice-Secretary OS Vladislav Grib, also as a staff of the FIIN Institute.
The group told RBK daily that it was not right to share candidates to human rights defenders and forces and not agreed that the Chairman of the Commission was sufficiently able to prevent its work.
The group is not taken to predict the results of the vote of the OOP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended option will be made within the next days of the vote.
Australian woman appeals against the term of prison in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sidnea sentenced to 15 prisons on the island of Phuckett for a false appeal for the attack of a taxiist, gave appeal to condemnation and was released under the contract.
Steve Roshel Bamford was initially recognised by the Phucket Provincial Court on 15 June by a false search after the police reported that the local taxist was attacked at Sunday, on 10 June, while two other men held it.
However, the video watch cameras later found that she was well returned to her hotel after the breakdown of her Australian fighter.
The Phucket police asked Bamford for two days before she acknowledged that the story was manufactured.
She was in local police cameras before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-second prison period in the centre of the maintenance of the Phuckett overseas, not in the women ' s prison for adults.
She is the daughter of the Australian League Peter Tanx, who was called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for the help of her daughter.
Tanx said the sitizen Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” by her daughter’s welfare and waited for her return to Australia.
“ Obviously it was an worried time, but we hope that she will return home as soon as possible, ” said Tanx.
Banford was appealed to his sentence and was released under 500,000 baths.
According to the reports in Australia, it is in that time to carry out its leave to the crowd area in South Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford currently represented a local lawyer in Phokeet, but they warned that the appeal could lead to the court to increase its sentence for two years and allow it to delay the terms for adults.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian tourist Michel Smith in Pucket Tayland, it may also try to restore its subordinated tourist ham, which will lead to a sentence.
Roman Sanchin is now in Paris with the presentation of his Roman Eltsies, translated into French.
Remember, his roman became the finalist of the four predecessors: "Food Pool", "Russian Bucker", "National Unitseller" and "The Great Book".
In the past year, the writer of this book was authorized by the Government of the Russian Culture Federation.
Roman Saintin is an unbelievable leader in the generation of current thirty-year-old projects.
Practically, every publication of its heavy publications, which are built in the modern life material, has a huge conflict between the different critics.
It can be said that a single article on the prosecution and publication of Sencin, the reviews on its books and magazine publications are made up a favorite and unexpected Russian literature from the end of the 1990s to the beginning of 2010.
In the discussions on the "one of the most coherent writers" said the criticism of Sergey Chuppin, mostly it is that its participants understand the word "literature", which is real and future, not only our word, but also our life.
Unfortunately, the number of books did not allow to include the majority of its articles and reviews from regional media and blogs.
Analytical and review articles are generally given in reducing the Absay Sections ...
