The triumph of the right populations in Austria: in total 29%
The perceived indeboltion of both existing parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-related popular parties has brought, in seconds, the first provisional results, to the previous parliamentary elections of Domenica in Austria.
The Austrian Popular Party (EVP), within which the position of President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously empty, has immediately lost strong.
On the contrary, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÃ), the under-prefect of Krnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the trionphal return to the national policy.
According to the provisional results, however, the strongest part of the country remains the socio-democratic (SPUE) with 29.8% of the votes, than the last 2006 elections, 5.5%.
It's still worse for UVP, which lost nearly 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian history of the Nachguerra, and especially the literally catastrophic result of the peoples, which have caused advanced elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the UVP abandoned the coalition, the people had a significant benefit in the preferences before the SPUE.
But the electors clearly punished them because they made the government astray.
Yes, in the first responses to the results there have been speculations about the possible divisions of the president of the party, Vice-Chair Wilhelm Montererer.
The observers believe that they could already happen on Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party's direction.
This evolution could facilitate the way towards the most likely way out of the electional result, namely towards the renewing of the SPÖ coalition and the EVP.
With regard to the strengthening of both the peoples of the right - the liberalist parties (FPUE) have previously gained 18% and BZÃ 11% of votes - but the socio-democratics have at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populations agreed with the collective government, (the FPUE was still unite, in 2005, separated from the European Union) which had been a reason for sanctions by the European Union.
On this evolution obviously plays Haider, which has already declared that it is ready to cooperate with any party and takes a return to Vienna to the national policy.
It has also been possible to enter the Green Party, but it is slightly falling, and from the third to the fifth place of Austrian political parties.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered in Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can relax
If the problem was not able to resolve with the Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of shuttles in India, it would have been according to the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain recovery of the Czech-Indonesian reports.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after the meeting today with its Indian homolog Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it would not be solved, then if, if there would be a certain refrigeration," he observed after the meeting which was held under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that the executive power may difficultly enter into the legal facts.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švacha, which has been assured by the accused and punished with a currency, the Central Government may negotiate with the local in Dardjeeling what happens under its court.
"It might be resolved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced for three years of prison, calling for a higher instance.
Then you can ask the release on warranty and wait for the judgment in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner has expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommendate the Court of Justice then will be able to obtain the grace," said the Chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can enter into the case is to provide the "competent legal aid", supported the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such support is already providing the Indian party.
"We have the most interest in maintaining the best relationships with India for many years.
He also admits the Indians," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to ŠTK, before his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic gives great importance to the problem of the entomologys in Czech.
"We really consider a deep error the reclusion and accusement of these ceched scientists," said.
The Minister has avoided responding to the question whether he has obtained the promise to take care of this.
"I've got so much promise," he only found.
A Czech judge in the battle for marine fundamentals
It is close to the electronic map on the wall on which Australia is drawn and the marine zones.
But it is not interested in the continent but to a small point lost in the sea blue.
"The island belongs to all Australia and together with her the marine basic academic.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, which is part of a team of 33 workers of OSN for marine issues and marine rights.
His head, the Czech lawyer of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exhibition and all of which adds.
Domestics the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The marine fundamental still hides a unrecognised world of natural resources.
It is possible to find the oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but also the organisms living unknown until now that bring the key to discover the medicine against cancer.
The largest base of the terrace
Cost States have started to give interest to the submare territory.
According to the OSN Convention, they are sufficient for laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Japan.
This is mainly the area of the continental platform which often extends to hundreds of miles from the coast of the state concerned.
This is the view of the convention that it has an exclusive right to all the resources of the continental platform.
"In a few words for continental platforms, the part of the marine fundamentals and its subsuola that is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called economic area is often extended beyond the territorial sea over 200 miles of Nautic", explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country presents before the Committee for the Determination of the dimensions of the continental platform should be accompanied by a very wide technical and scientific documentation based on many cost-related investigations and measurements.
It is the result of a number of years of preparation.
" One of our tasks is to search for legal and technical assistance to the Committee.
The Commission has agreed until 5 requests for Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the three last names have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
The recent success of Australia, which has significantly extended its marine possessions, has registered a global economist.
But also the New Zealand has won us - the surface of the marine base, which has been allocated by the Commission last week, about 1,6 square miles, so more or less than six times greater than the state itself.
All and two countries have invested in the search for a million dollars.
The benefit, which will be frustrated in the future by the marine fundamentals, as they repromise, will be inestimable.
Other States will also have their requests gradually.
They can do this for ten years since it was ratified "the Montego Bay Convention."
There, where the continental platform starts the sub-ocean area that the Convention has declared the common heritage of humanity."
There was no one who had had been an exclusive position.
The right of extradition in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the marine foundation is not Klondike," says director Mikulka, "with the fact that his single parties are legally demarked and their contracted regime."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the marine fundamental is also part of the Czech Republic today.
If it disappears with other states of the former Soviet block in the framework of the Joint Interocean metal organization.
This has acquired in 1991 according to the convention, as well as the investors of few other states, the status of the "pioniere investor".
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the extended Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and little greater than the former Czechoslovakia.
The fund is frastified, it is a nearly submarin replica of Tatry.
"It's possible to extract on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich jacket of polymetal agglomerates containing nichel, rame, cobalt and Mananese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker of the Macedonia Rober Sandev's division's worker has a record to show it.
It looks like a small patate or with a fantasy pool, a legendary scheme, as in the linda of the Golem’s wave.
German special units were present at the release of obstacles
The Egyptian government had requested support to Germany for the release of obstacles – the experts were then arrived.
When the situation became critical, special units were ready, but they were not intervened.
In the circumstances of the release of the 11 sequenced European barriers, there are always more detailed information.
On the salvation operation as the Ministry of Defence and the Internal Ministry has participated in the German special units.
In addition to army experts, GSG9 units, the federal police, the Federal Criminal Office and the logistic experts of the technical institution were presented on place.
As reported by the portion of the ministers on Monday night, German units have not been intervened because the sequestriers, given the danger of a force intervention, have released obstacles to escape.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by the Germans to join as a direct assistance on place.
"We haven't arrived for luck," says a call from the Ministry of Internal.
Agressors raised a group of travellers in the south of Egypt on September 19: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptians.
After the driving in a wilderness area in the south of Egypt, the obstacles have been deported in the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Ciad.
The identity of raders until the end is being secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The released in frattempo arrived in good conditions to Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the free obstacles are under the protection of the German ambassador.
It has not been explained about the delivery details.
There was no information in Berlin, for when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Image" newspaper, the 5 holidays and special units should go to flight with a military aircraft Airbus and arrive on Tuesday in Germany.
American representation room rejects the saving package.
The first room of the United States Congress has just failed the saving package of $7,700 billion for financial markets.
Dow Jones's falling down.
With 206 votes to 227, the representative American house rejected the government's saving package for financial markets.
Despite the calls of President George W. Bush and the first plan of both parties, there was no majority for the program, with which the chaos of the financial markets would be argued.
In a dramatic action, supporters have tried desperately to convince the critics from the weak package of $7,700 mld.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the treaty, encouraged Members to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have recognition to avoid something that has not yet arrived..
While the suffix was in course, the Dow Jones is covered by more than 6% or 600 points.
The reason for investors' concern was that the state saving package could fail.
Once before the end of the vote, thereafter, after the announcement of the failure, it was recovered again.
The experts are now waiting for other serious turbulents on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enter into force, it must be necessary to benefit both from the room of the Members and the senate.
Promotors register digits in increased reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to a study, the fact that travel reservations for the next months compared to the previous year have increased clearly - for the winter stage adjusting more than 30%.
Despite weaknesses of conjunction, the desire to travel from Germans stands on a survey remains slow.
In the winter season reservations, travel agencies registered more than 31 % than the same period of the previous year, as he informed the German DRV Association for Tourism in Berlin.
According to the investigation of the GfK market research Institute, there is also increased reserve rates for the months of autumn.
As the outcome of travel agencies for October 2007 would be at about 11%, the DRV reported.
Provision for these results is the GfK's figures, which annually analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and puts statistical projections for the whole market.
The travel reservations would also be performed until August 2008.
Because of the weak quotation of the dollar, in particular the travels in the United States would be requested, reported the DRV.
Here, the increase of reservations would lead to a third.
Moreover, they would be able to travel in Germany, Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as internal locations in Germany.
Most of all travels, including high quotation, explained the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increased costs for food energy and generics, the costs in this case would be better calculable for customers than for individually organized holidays."
Consumers could recover money through, among others, discounts for reserves made with strong advances or offered with everything even, explained Laepple.
Even the last months would have registered excellent reservation digits, so that in comparison with the year before the facture would again be registered - even if, according to another study, the number of Germans who have taken a trip, comparing with the previous year is slow.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Hits in Ballermann, sweet birds of a litro and vip in Dirndln shocked.
A Debt to Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I are not really common.
You're bionda, television moderate and induce a Dirndl made on measure .
I have the hairs, I'm student, and my clothes are second hand.
One thing, however, is common to us: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, the photos are already launching against us and shoot photos to fill the memory of photo machines – very lusing, and this is my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how friends are doing
Dirndl's two money seems to get his goal.
As a tourist of Wiesn and a real resident in the north of the equator of the white salt, the sense of well-being in costs and habits until now remains in the limits.
And instead, once arrived to Theresienshise, it is nothing serious
Almost everyone takes the Dirndl or skin pants; no one looks disgusted or sweet - everything perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's shoes collects strange eyes at the stand of bananas to chocolate.
A monastery notes me that I would have shooted the snake in wrong way: "A left you are free, at the center of six virgins, to the right hand you're impeded, behind you."
Suspiciously, I'm the fiocco back to the left.
All right," says it and ride.
Others are less flairt technical subtle and indossing tits of feelings, on which it covers "To drunk to get clothesed!" and shoot the sweet back against a not invited.
The boy with exhibition inclinations is called Bob, coming from England and also visits the Octtoberfest for the first time.
Find it "gorgeous", with a strict "ooooo".
This tells me, after you're free from your bird mouth from a drinker before.
I'm close to one of these hydrats, which everyone thinks it's a patch.
Bob is also one of these famous "Wildbiesler".
Others don't have the luck to free from alcohol in this way.
On the eighth night they walk in white on the place of the feast, the healthy ones who have to take care of the poor ones.
Nurseers commit each time in white – always 4 times through a swimming bar covered in the tent.
This works as with most of the Wiesn visitors: you'll be empty, you're back.
Those who smell under the phone in this drink bar in the blood aren't seen.
"These are those where goarnimmer packn", one of the healthcares slows to me and shoots in the baraonda.
The victim of a police accident identified
An 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital after being invested by a vehicle while walking in Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved on Thursday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
You've been brought to the Queen's Hospital, to Romford, but she's dead a little later.
After the incident, a 51-year-old man was arrested by the unexpected guidance accused.
It was released on warranty.
Turkey is enlarging the diplomatic horizons
As far as Turkey tried to enter the European Union, European powers were shocked to deepen in Turkey.
On the eastern part of the Bosforo, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, there is one of the most beautiful religions of this imperial dignity.
The train station of Hydarpasha was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-reascimental style.
This is at least what the tourist guides tell you.
The building is horses between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its edges, looking at the world as some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is spoiled.
The whole building was sweetly decade.
But once in the ticket office of the suffix once, there is no doubt about the size of the company of what was the most western passenger.
The station opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay to the imperial game, wanted to realize his ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this rail that runs in Damasco, Baghdad and further in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the imperial ambitions of Germany were slaughtered during the first world war.
His rail was attacked by Lawrence d'Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed
The British and dominant forces moved out of Egypt and pulled the Turkeys and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there were bad news also for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition train disappeared by destroying his developed tea.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then it was slowly in disappointment, long overcome by history.
But today, this rail rail for Anatolia and all the east points, they serve - at least symbolicly - to higher diplomatic horizontals in Turkey.
The Governing Party of Justice and Development - the ACP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its circumstance regions, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed.
There is a new commitment policy now.
It is noted that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian Hamas and Fatah factions, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new external policy, I have been shipped on the vacuum for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main experts of the ACP's foreign policy, Mrs Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten hours and half after - after a subbalts course along the tracks that produced the ancient world chains of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the capital of Turkey - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to return the shoes to his past ottoman.
But the ACP, with its well known Islamic roots, is a movement in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspects in the Western, more significantly in Washington.
A taxi takes me in the general area of the ACP, a ultramodern structure of stone and steel - built at hoc - in a sub-commerce on the way of development, rounded by commercial centres built and power-scakes, where the managers are full of business - both men and women - meets to make contracts of first morning.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a political center from almost any other political party in Europe.
Complete, cravat, I'm sure I had a Blackberry too.
"The purpose of the external policy party now is to reintegre Turkey with its nearest neighbors.
The cold war was an anonymity," says me.
Turkey has been distracted out of its insideland.
Today it must look at the east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one or another.
They should be both.
"But surely at a certain point, "I ask, "The Turkey will decide?"
"The Turkey," said, "not wants to go to that choice."
Then it highlights a point that almost all those with whom I spoke here have reiterated: the links of not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, are benefits of Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole Europe can metaforically walk those rail lines to the east through Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at the Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen, Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who had seen this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised it would have been to find that the Middle Eastern ambitions of Europe can now be in the hands of Turkey.
And while looking at the terminal for the tragedy that brings me back through the Bosforo, I remember that Turkey has always been called "the sick man in Europe".
So, at least, it seemed not to be doubtful about which continent should be progressed in this attractive country.
Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown wrote: as a musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologio, 11 September) had in charge the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the coro.
As a member of his music scheme for municipality, the next year founded his wonderful young, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under 21/ under the 21 years, but at the time of the Proteus sang his end in 1979, many of us were more than 20 - we simply refused to reject the core.
The name "Proteus" (the mythology being mutable) represented the good will of the cor and the ability to face everything that the music had to do, both madriguels and Messianics, without accompanying or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versastigity produced by such a young coro was often awesome, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often it was told by Tod to let us speak for himself.
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's all there in music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the battery was absolutely clear and precise, although it was never dittatoriale or floral.
Whatever the musical standard was, it was always higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If I had to call a horseman director would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew it very well during the two decades in which the Guildford Philharmonic led from 1962 to 1982.
During the past 40 years and more I have concerned more than 100 of its concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been disputed with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated orchestra directors who, in his words, simply "cavalled around the world one or two well-known cheaps of battle."
He's missing so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your necrology by William Woodruff (25 September) indicated that "in 1946 he re-educated economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a scientific width, a letter and a PhD."
This results from the note of Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, completed a PhD tess on the British Gomma Industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He passed 1950-51 in the United States as researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953 Notingham was permanently left for the Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Filistology
"Recommendating the show of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life", because its photos in white and black, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have attracted my attention to simply and the strength they transmit, although they treat the protagonists with particular respect.
A show that you're making very feelings.
Resino can catch magic moments."
Second assault for the supervended Honda
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation of the model Jazz.
If the previous model was already with great housing, this new monovolume has a larger internal space.
To all, it will be added to a refined mechanical that increases the guiding comfort and allows to save fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz presents a very similar line to that of the previous model, changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among the other, it is the worth to signal an innovative design, a new platform, larger and new mechanical dimensions.
However, before passing to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after the entry into the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first comment is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter times than those used by other producers.
Although the model Jazz is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in the fact of sales.
It is exactly the case of Japan, where Jazz was the most sold in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, almost a million Jazz units were sold since the time of the launch.
The second market was the of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow increased sales in the segment.
So, if the Japanese company has sold a total of 83.000 units in this model in 2007, estimates will be added for 2009 around 100,000 automobile, providing an increase in sale of 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honduras has sold a total of 8.000 Jazz units since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of the total sales in Honduras in Spain.
With regard to the new generation, the Spanish subsidiary responsibilities are expected to sell around 2.000 Jazz units in the arc of a year.
Even with the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda .di to reduce the sell rate in Spain.
In fact, the firm responsibilities are expected to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22.000 sold units, or 4.000 in less than in 2007, with a low of 16%.
In spite of the increase in the sales, Honduras increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8% in front of 1,6% of the last year.
In addition, the Japanese company is expected to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve, the Honda trusts in the coming of another model.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4,37 meters of length - from which the Japanese society hopes to sell about 200,000 units every year throughout the world.
For the markets and according to the estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of the sales of Insight will be held in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after submission in company in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches the 3.90 meters (5 centimeters in more), the width of 1.69 metres (2 centimeters in more) and the total of 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained invariable to 1.52 meters.
Within the dimensions, the habitable inside will also be expanded.
This benefit results from the insertion of a new platform, and on the other hand by the introduction of the fuel serbatorium in central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
Furthermore, the baggage capacity – with double background - sale to 399 litres, i.e., 19 litres more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measures of the engine version 1.4, and that the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - more than for external elements, such as poster lid or the possibility of mounting panoramic glass - concern an improvement in the fact that accessibility to the after-seats.
The doors that allow access to post positions are actually opened with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Furthermore, engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in benzine models by 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Among the mechanisms include the i-VTEC technology that allows to reduce consumption, produce less carbon biosside emissions, optimize the mechanism and at the same time the driving couple of the engine is higher in all its phases.
The 1 2 litre model allows to use a power of 90 cv to 6.000 tours with a maximum of 114 Nm. to 4.900 turns.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached the 78 horses - uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of approximately 125 grams.
With regard to the previous propulsion, which used 83 horses in the model of first generation, now are available to 100.
The Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses reach a combination of 5,4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "ape car" to avoid collisions
In the context of the development of incident prevention technologies, Nissan has inspired, this time, the nature, and in particular the fires.
The Japanese society has created a robot that, taking the fire flight for example, knows avoiding incidents.
It's the Bio-mimetic Car Robbot Drive, or BR23C, or the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co Technology Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Science and Technology of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General of Public Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, the BR23C is an expansion of the Safety School of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collision in the cars of the producer house.
During the flight, each app creates a personal space in oval form that is very similar to the Nissan security school.
But the most important thing is the eyes of the fire, which can see in all directions with an angle above 300 degrees, and which allow the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To re-create this visual functionality, engineers have put the point to what they defined a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the barriers that are before the BR23C for a ray within the two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance compared to the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor that immediately allows to prevent collision.
"In the moment when a barrier appears, the small robot imitates the movements of an ape and changes immediately the direction around the right or greater roads to avoid collision.
The most clear difference with any assisted system is that the evasion handling is completely instinct.
"If not so, robot would not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Lab, and engineering head of this project.
Unlike a blue, robot can't go to the top or to the low, and even in diagonal; it can be moved only into two sizes and in the direction where you can turn its routes and do not use infinite directions and ways as fires do.
This is why Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot may avoid collisions.
"This device has only need to prepare information every few seconds, and acting out of these data.
It does not require the memorisation of information or the intuitive logical of the previous manuals, so it can work without interruptions and only with a couple of dozens of memory KB.
This can be surprised, but we're not talking about memory gigabytes, and even mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the emergency prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will be a series in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymers, which are lighter and more harder than typology with lithium iones.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to destination by avoiding barriers present in the path.
Trima before requesting a loan
We must recognise that the Department of the United States Department, instead of having many capitals to take action, isn't certainly ingenious.
In front of the crisis, and in order to avoid the Americans join each other in unsolved banking, they have created a divertible and institutional game for the network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Chrown Hotel" or the problems.
The aspect of this system and, in particular, its receiptist serves to induce to think not one, but two or even three times before requesting a loan.
And especially where to do it, that is probably the primary goal.
Of course the information that the game provides is useful, but it results little detailed.
It's more a page for adolescents than a website for the wide public.
What happens if the game is complete?
Well, compare a dream room in the hotel.
It's always something, because buying a better house isn't even talking...
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the subscription of an agreement with the Missubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a quota equal to 21% of participation in the Society, which has arrived after a net retail of its actions in Borsa.
One week after the establishment of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley shareholders at the individual cost of $25,25, or a sum equal to $3 billion.
The fixed price is lower than 19% than the accountable value of the titles to 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible holdings to a conversion price of 31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall operation would be carried out on the basis of a average price of $29, or a percentage lower than its current course of 28%.
By 17.00, however, the title Morgan Stanley was 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley in bank holding company," explained John Mack, director-General of the United States Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow you to differentiate its actions, however, to go under control of the Federal Reserve.
Their alliance with MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis covers the largest names of Wall Street to adopt a more careful attitude than the subject in the previous year.
The Monday Conditions also show that in the last days the agreement was amended: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese colony for a sum equal to 8.5 billion dollars.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: "We thought that our participation share would only be composed of regular actions.
But in view of the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect us."
Based on the average price, MUFG will obtain the Morgan Stanley titles at a price lower than their 7% account value.
The operation would be carried out with an investment of at least 20% of equity on diluted basis."
The agreement provides that the MUFG could convert half of its preferential titles in regular actions in a year when, during a period of this period, this last has been exchanged by more than 50% under the fixed conversion price, or about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital granted by MUFG would allow him to cover investment opportunities, strengthen its budget and increase their liquidity.
However, a call from the group has refused to provide specifications on the strategic projects of the two new partners.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a solution coefficient Tier One is around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has expressed the fact that it had "really" supported its budget from the end of August.
In recent weeks, the group has proved hardly, which has seen the value of its actions while the insurance cost against the risk has immediately been slow.
The moon reflux, however, remaining at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, the Goldman Sachs, one other "persist" between the large investment banks of Wall Street after the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers' crollo and Merrill Lynch, announced that they had risked $15 billion, in part at the Berkshire Hathaway Group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa at Quito this Monday.
Funding the Republic on a Socialism just at the XXIst century.
This is the common project of the venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the boulevian Evo Morales and the magician Rafael Correa.
Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, this was the last to vote to the project of a new Constitution.

Rafael Correa had revended in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his Constitution project.
"The Constitution has glorifiedly trionphated," she was assured, congratulating with the magicians in the guayaquil governator, 280 miles southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales welcomed Rafael Correa as his heavenly homolog Michelle Bachelet.
The scrutin, which has been carried out in all calm after the Electoral Observation Mission of the United States (EEA), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the 'new socialism' defended by the President.
This draft Constitution confers the power of the state of the economy, preserving the "development planning" of a country which is essentially living in the extraction of oil carried out by large foreign companies and, accordingly, their currency.
Concepted by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also granted greater power to the Head of State, which can be elected for two consequent mandates of four years of age, will have the possibility of disclosing the assembly.
Correa has already announced the intention of exercising this amendment and reproporting its candidate for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the free health and education services, which the President has started to promote in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives under the poority.
It is also prohibited the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of a magnetic base as a start point for American drug operations.
The 19 shops free in Ciad
A Egyptian command has launched the slaughter of the eight tourists and their eight accompanying accommodations ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eight European tourists and their eight Egyptian accompanies held in the wilderness for ten days have been reported Monday, Health and Safety, in the capital of Egypt.
On the morning, they were released in Ciad from a Egyptian command.
Apparently, the obstacles arrived at the military base of Almaza, near the Cairo International Airport, around 15 and 30, on board of a special aircraft.
On the board of a helicotter, they were immediately transferred, without giving any interview to the print, to the hospital of Maadi, a Cairo residential periphery, to be subject to analysis.
Godon of "good health" and no rescue was paid "the sequestrators", stated the Egyptian minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna.
On September 19, during a safari in 4x4 at the foot of the Oanat Mountain, confined with Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of obstacles was packed by a hide condition to the other 35 unknown sequestrators.
The group was formatted by 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four users, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the organizational agency of Safari.
A Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, on board of two elicoters, had launched the slaughter during the night, just before the sun.
"There have been shooted, half of the sequestrators have been killed, while the others were fled," said the responsible who asked to keep the animated.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "Lampo" unit have been sent in Sudan, where they would support German and Italian commands.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italian Franco Frattini stressed the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We have to admit that if we obtained this result has been thanks to the professionality and effectiveness of the men of our secret services, special forces", said, without further details.
He also forgot payment of a ransom.
On the day before, the Sudan army had said to intercept a 4x4 vehicle on the board of which the sequestrians were found and killed them six, including the chadian leader of the raders, and to have captured them two.
According to the army, the sequestrators would be linked to a Darfur's rebellion organization, the movement for the Liberation of the Sudan (SLA_U), a statement immediately dismissed by this latter.
Lettere- The most silence of the culture
First page, a debate on the financing of the culture on which the current election campaign is focused.
So better.
But a part of our cultural life remains in shadow.
Who will come to declare the bad sums granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological scans, or the national historical places that are hungry?
What policy will have to do to remind the federal government that is cutting monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, as in Canada, do we have no real laws and laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government was three million and half euros for the only rebuilding of the castle of Chinon in the Loira Valley?
The Constitution is to say that the protection of the heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authorities and every government department, and all this of the common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Historical Society Federation of Quebec, at least 40 000 volunteers, who, grouping in 211 companies for the safeguard of the historical, genealogical heritage, archives and heritage goods, maintain, with four money, private archives and archive sites.
They are they who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of desperation when real estate businesses and decisional bodies attack our forgotten remains and cities.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
The Benelux governments nationalize a part of the Fortis bank
The Benelux States help the Belgian and Dutch Fortis Bank through a partial nationalization, which is difficult for Europe for the crisis of the US credit market: the three nations will provide 11,2 billion euros to the financial institutions - insurance also in Hungary.
The Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands at the end of the week have agreed at the maximum level, also involved the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission for Competition.
In the euro area the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been discussed for more than one year is that of the Fortis bank, and the decisions taken in this regard can be a previous.
In accordance with the Sunday Decision, all and three States will delay almost half (49%) of the bank quota present in the country.
The bank will certainly sell almost part of its interests, including before all assets, especially insurance, from the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week, the actions of the Fortis had started with a vertical crown, signs of crisis of the institution were then presented in the second half of the week.
However, analists agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow them to fall.
The bank's shares have fallen almost 12%, the lower point of 14 years.
The value of the actions is reduced from January to more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the total capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but the bank leaders say that this value is not real.
The company's headquarters imposes the crown of Fortis actions to the incertitudes of the European foreign market due to the acceptation of the US plan from 700 billion dollars.
Wednesday, the title was slowly out.
Thursday, Philip Derrckx was appointed a new delegated bank administrator.
The Financial Institute has also seen private purchasers but yet no one has been presented with a valuable offer.
The Belgian government had already assured that investors should not be afraid of losing money.
Between bank clients have not spread the panic, the branches have not been assaulted.
In Hungary, the Fortis has autonomy branches and has also acquired leasing deals.
The volpe in the polar
In America, insurers on life and health, on the basis of the data of human medical acquisition, often refuse to establish an insurance contract.
Privacy experts are afraid that the data market becomes uncontrolled.
"In any case, there is a private program that the use of the prescription data depends on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be independent, otherwise it is how to trust the pollage to the volpe" - write the Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the medicine requirements.
The insurance companies subordinate the insurance rate and the census in the case of injury to the state of the customers' health and, if they are too high, the risk of insurance does not imply.
It was time that the customer had to be subjected to a medical visit, and the contract was established only after the investigation.
10 years ago Dick has invented a very much more economic procedure: based on the identification code of the customer, you can easily have information from the medicines on which medicines have been purchased in the last year and half and this program requires which diseases suffer and where health conditions are found.
For example, if you regularly purchase large quantities of colesterol reductions, that means that the weight level in blood is in practice unreasonablely high and is classified in the higher risk category.
In trade there are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplicator, the assurer therefore remains not much, even though small difficulties are presented.
Among the contrary, some medicines are useful for more purposes, for example, some compositions are necessary against emergency or warm vampets, but are also effective against depression.
This latter, from the insurance point of view - commercially, as a risk increase factor, the first two no.
For the request and processing of data, companies were formed by part and these, before obtaining the necessary information from the medicine, request the patient's approval.
Now the authorities are able to do so even if they have not affected much for nervousness.
Some recently mentioned are also preparing the result of laboratory reviews and connecting them to medical consumption data to provide a more specific image of the health status of patients.
More data have access to data and parallelly the use control will be more difficult.
There is a law on privacy, but its validity is extended only to health services and insurance.
From the Congress there is a legislative proposal that gives control power to companies specialized in data service.
Richard Dick acknowledges that it is not enough: this is why he developed a program that linked the other data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another matter is that the person concerned cannot denied the approval because otherwise the insurers do not imply the contract.
So, at the end, the gallines are afforded to the clemance of the volp.
Global Marshall Menu
European Union and India double the trade
Since the European Union and India are partners who are mainly mutually trade, also the agenda of the nine meeting day has been dominated by this topic, in addition to all the other global problems.
Today there will be a French and Indian top which will first be addressed by the Atomic Energy Cooperation.
The European Union recognizes the fact that India is being a large democratic power that should be given more in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to decide whether to support or not the new Delhi as a permanent member in the United Nations Security Council.
Thus, it was not insisted on this issue in the nineth organized summit in Marsella yesterday.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso Chairman of the Committee and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received the first Indian Minister Manmohan Singh, with which they found the agreement to duplicate in five years, to increase up to 100 billion euros, the trade.
Whereas the exchange of goods was out of 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not too ambitious.
Consequently, 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have been unified from the legal view, so the air traffic can also take the way in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed the agreement.
The objective is to balance because while the EU is the first commercial partner of India, New Delhi is only the nine place between the EU partners.
The top has devoted attention to the global facts.
In the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the terrorism, this last condemned both parties in all its forms and urged the convocation of a United Nations conference.
They emphasized the conclusion of the Doha Round commercial, although both parties had a role in the failure of this.
The EU confirmed continuing in the energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce at least 20% by 2020.
In addition, India is agreed with this, as well as with the fact that there should be a global counterparty to the programmed climate conference for the next year and reduced 50% of steel gas production by 2050.
They also want to raise the increase in the prices of food products and have supported the convocation of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The first minister of India today will be entered into the French capital where a bilateral meeting is ready to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris it is expected that the French reactors receive a commodity of the value of EUR 20 billion to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to our printing Agency, the agreement would be 15 years old.
Francoforte more than three hundred Italian editors
The Italian editors’ presence at the International Fire of the Francoforte Book.
More than three hundred Italian editors will be present at the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Fire of the Francoforte Book is waiting for this edition of more than 7000 expositors from 101 different countries that will take place at the 171.790 square meters of the Fire with more than 403mile titles in display and with Turkey as honour guests.
It will be the Sub-Secretariat to the Minister for Benes and CulturalActivities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government in the Italian Padiglion inauguration ceremony: Italy will actually be present with an Italian Point - 264 square meters of exposure space.
It will follow the printing meeting at the Structure Room in Bookmesse page 5.0: This will be the opportunity to present digits, trends and perspectives on the status of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, it gradually reduces the weight of foreign author books on total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and children.
Find the plane of Steve Fossett's aircraft that's gone a year ago
The flight of Steve Fossett's aircraft was found on September 3, 2007 while flying on the Nevada wilderness.
The routines were returned to a 3000 meter high level, in the Sierra Nevada of Mamoth Lakes area, to the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no humans inside the velvel.
The Sheriff of the Madera Council, John Anderson, fled the doubts remaining: "The airline has been located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmed that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day where he was gone," said in a print conference.
Hence, the sheriff precisely stated that there were no human returns in the aircraft, nor in the surrounding area.
The milliardary, 63-year, was given for death in February.
The United States Transport Security Office (Ntsb) has known that some hours after the resident's notice, a survey team was sent, which then identified the device: it is just Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since 3 September 2007, when Fossett was taken from Gerington to Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Last night, always in California, not far away from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fossett had been returned from a couple near their habitation of Mamoth Lakes.
This is two documents with the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of the Illinois, money in container and a felpa.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearing.
The milliardary was conquered a place in the history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, the first man became to complete the world's round on a aerostatic ball: two weeks of flight in solitary.
Three years later, he did the world's turn in an aircraft and without shock.
Among his many records, even the flight of 15,445 meters of height, above the Andes, but with a copilote.
Glk, the advertising you don't wait
A Suv outside the schemes with an original and well defined by decisive line, wide surface and net angles.
This is, in synthesis, Glk the last born between the "compacts" offers from the star house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to make a sale of newness in this sector.
It will also be unexpected and unconventional the communication that will comply with the Suv Glk launch, available at the Mercedes-Benz showroom on October 17th.
Thus the advertising battle that will comply with the debt of the new vehicle will start an unfair communication mode, even through an advenising campaign in 3D, which is used for the first time in Italy by an automobilistic brand.
A project of maxi-fictions, articulated in three different phases, will dominate the centralist through the Milan shopping, Corso How, up to November 15.
The first stage of this new type of communication will start with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special eyes distributed in Corso How you can see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image will have the impression that the car is out of the show.
Next, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8, the new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, then restored in a single image.
Nevertheless Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something again in the stereotyped field of car communication.
Will it be with this form to study the interest of the future purchasers?
Here are the Italian hooligans
From Triveneto, they're risking the Dapo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls whose entire Italy is now angry? They are part of the "Other Italian" group that has come to the Blue National for years and, for the truth, had never created too many problems.
Never if he was shocked with adverse torments.
The extraction of the group is right.
Promotors are from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
These were added to Sofia groups (in reality a few units) from the campaign and the Puglia.
There are three color bandiers where they composed the citys of origin of the war: Sabbath night have been removed to be not identified.
They are inspired to the English tifoseria.
In Bulgaria, they found a real nazis strike in Levski.
The Figc had prepared 144 Italian tickets for the game: all nominatives, so easily controlable.
And Viminale had controlled them all: among the parties for Sophia there was no one with a current Dapo, no one who had been injected by freshing a stage.
In the four blue strips, which had previously been sentenced from stadium, the ticket was in fact rejected and prevented the transfer.
Viminale now expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then take measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Dapo at least five years to those who have been arrested or who has been identified in disorders.
An international dupo that prevents not only Italian stages but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, instead, will not put foot in a stage.
For luck.
But now there's fear-evolution: that's the little more than 100, if they add others.
"We have to explode this fire immediately and not legitimate who acts in this way," they support the Viminale.
Thus, "they are goodly opened in view of the National Game of Mercedes in Lecce."
In Puglia there is actually a small nucleus of the Ultra Italian supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets the Casms, which can also contain on a section of the Aasis, namely the secret services, which are very concerned with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce colors and the teased arm during the ring of Mameli? In Bulgaria isn't wrong...".
This is the thought (expressed in a really little way) of Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the place that first was Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
For example, there was a Trieste Mazzilli where there was a nucleus of supporters from the Ultra Italian group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it has not been infringed to the Dutch but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 thrs has been terrorized.
"I do not do sociologue - add the Osservation No1 - the crimes will be assigned in the country where the fact is happening.
Until now this group remained in line, we'll see what happened and we'll be worthy for the future.
But we also talk about fishes at the ring of Mameli: even those who are not wrong, but if you allow me to be not educational...".
