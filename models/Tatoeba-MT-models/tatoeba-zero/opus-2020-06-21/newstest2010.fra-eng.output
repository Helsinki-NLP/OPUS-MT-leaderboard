Barack Obama will be the fourth President of the United States to receive the Nobel Peace price
The US President Barack Obama will take place for Oslo in Norway for 26 hours and be the fourth President of the history to receive the Nobel Prize of Peace.
The diplomacy, the medal and the cheque of $1,4 million will be delivered among them for its exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among the nations.
The Chief of the White House, as well as his wife Michelle will land in the Norwegian Metropolis on the morning and will have a loaded program.
It will first take place to the Nobel Institute, where it will first meet the five members of the Committee who selected it in October between 172 and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then provides an interview with the king of Norway Harald V and the Queen Sonja.
The visit will know its sum in the afternoon at a single ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious reward.
It will be the fourth President of the United States to receive it, but only the third that is going to take the price in the Committee itself.
The White House reported that Obama would talk about war in Afghan during the transfer of prices.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because it is conscious of receiving this price as a President who brings a war in two countries at the current time.
He strengthened the war efforts some days ago by sending additional units to Afghan, which would not forget to stress.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medaille, a diploma and a sweet ten million Sweden corones (approximately 1,1 million euros).
He gives it to works of goodness, but has not yet been practically decided on decisions.
His programme will then take it, as well as his wife to a banket, including the king and the king of Norwegia, the Head of Government and 250 other invitations.
Obama was instead reciprocal to that price at the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt not fully worthy of it.
He has also repeated several times that it is not a price for him alone, but for all those who defend the same values as he.
Since the advertising, he said that it would be an invitation to act for him.
A defender of the accused nature of changing
The police of Litomśice accused of changing the President of the Association of the Protectors Society of the Nature of Litomśice.
In the last year, he called for several construction chain procedures and requested money from investors for his personal benefit in exchange of his calling, said Alena Romova, the police's chairman of Litomśice.
The President of the Society of Protectors of Litomśice is Lubomír Studnička.
It is currently in detention and risk until three years of imprisonment.
The three bands of waste are not at the parfum in Brno
Everyone in Prague can spend his drink packs, while in the villages of South Moravians, you're falling on three swimming pools to every street round.
And Brno?
There, you should take a few minutes before finding the suitable bends.
I don't mean that we're not going to try all the waste in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal advisers of our city, the second larger city of the country, do not have enough interest in this problem.
Brno is at the age of the three of the waste not only because citizens can still try paper, drink, and PVC, but especially to see the number of bends given to these wastes.
Have you already tried to put a plastic bottle in the center of the villa?
It's all a science that requires especially time and nerves of axe.
The only place I've found for the moment is the place of Moravian face of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Subka and his colleagues don't want me, but that seems very little.
Unless talking about the fact that in other districts of the city, this is not an unclean.
So to end, many of my friends do not trie their waste.
It looks like it.
That makes them a shock to get up to the snakes.
This doesn't make me shock from their side.
I itself, after a party, I proposed to go get some drink and PVC bottles.
Except that I haven't seen no color rings in the Kounicova street.
Happy I found the suitable place by taking the tram.
This says, the waste was cut off.
It's after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the best city, isn't it?!
It is likely that ecology and pretended sthestism do not take too much interest in the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to purchase the city a first hockey location that hurts the city in the whole country, instead of buying some additional bends and offering more than three of the first materials for a own Brno.
I am glad to have comforted my impression with official statistics after a moment on the internet.
According to the ECO-COM society data, Brno is really the worst of the southern Moravia region.
The Parubek budget dismissed the silver retreats and illnesses
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or officials, there may be a lack of money for retreats, illness or households.
But also for the interests in the debt of the State or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of the next year, said the Minister of Finance of Eduard Janota.
When social-democratics and communists implyed the increase in some classs, they were based on the fact that the Government would make a premises for sensitive expenditures, retreats or illnesses. "There is only to reverse the problems later, mining the land," said Janota.
It is necessary to know that the payment interests are increasingly higher and that the refund will be required early or later.
The State does not really have the choice to know where the money is powerful.
If it does not decrease social aid or expenditure, taxes should be increased.
To all those who are left now increased: pompiers, institutes, farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and do not have to be afraid for their retreats or safeguards, of which 1,8 billion have disappeared.
But the expenses of a larger endlessness of the State - the next year he will therefore not miss 163 billion in the castles, but more.
Despite the efforts made by Minister Janota, the debt will grow rapidly and with it, the interest-related costs.
The State will need money for repayment and no longer will be sufficient to slightly increase TVA or to reduce maternity as the Government has made in its anti-deficit package.
It will also miss five billion to finish the constructions of roads and roads because of the transfer of money to a number of election groups.
This is mainly a decision-making and approached throwings that are not possible to change projects to reduce costs.
Most of them keep them, what isn't now free.
This means delaying or stopping thirty large channels, and the transfer of European funds is also in danger, according to the holding of Karel Hanzelka, the port of the Ministry of Transport.
The SSD proposed to resolve the very adverse financial deficit - it will be able to be in the dividends of the E.S.Z. (e.g. electric power distributor and distributor), which the State has largely partly and feed the transport funds.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is not in any case of a fundless potato.
Last year, there were 18 billion people who have been shipped from the EECEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends serve to pay the removal of ecological deterioration, to complement the pension accounts or to serve a reservation for the reform of retreats that are prepared.
Furthermore, this increases the real deficit of higher budget 5,7 per cent of the BCNs in accordance with EU rules.
And it's far to be the end of the transfer carnaval.
The budget for several deteriorations to the victims of communism and crimes, even households, has reduced almost three billion.
It is not sure that the State can act without that money.
It's a loterie.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it any way, confirms Janota.
The Minister should then economize the side of the department or, in the worst case, touch the Government ' s budgetary reservation.
It is also lacking 100 million to the State Case project of a value of two billion, which should allow to monitor online what expenditure of each administration is.
The first step will start in January.
If the Ministry of Finance did not find any other money, the project should be stopped and sanctions would be done, he warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
In the future, Americans consider a portable phone that will allow the user to pass from an operation system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed are promised.
It's enough with a button and you're going from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely the objective of the United States VMware society, which is mainly the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your portable phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in staff and professionals
The two will work at the same time, Mrs. Krishnamurti of the VMware company in an interview for computer magazine world.
He was submitted in November of the last year and was made a first demonstration just a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones does not result in the fiction.
VMware has already presented a test version to journalists with a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 changed with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously executed the mobile and Android systems mentioned.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full shore.
VMware company is now working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices in 2012.
The neighborhood in the mountain trace the hotels
Desearted tracks are not a problem only to remote-speed operators.
The lack of snow disappoints people to reserve their stay at the ski in hotels and pensions.
Indeed, it is always possible to start free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have many visits on our website.
Internauts spend the offers, request the prices, but do not impede to reserve for the time.
And if they call us, they immediately ask whether there's nine or boe in Christmas," said Martin Jandur, operating from Spindl.Info's portal.
If we want to pass the New Year of his dreams to Špindlerv Mløn, it's better to be too heavy to reserve.
If economic priority is given and the quality of hosting comes only later, then you can try to wait for a few days.
The hotels of Špindler propose only a weekly stay for the New Year.
I think they're going to try again a moment to enjoy them, but they'll also set up and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly reduce," Jandura estimated.
The Inground Tourist Agency of Vrchlabi also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas week for the moment, she is not completely sold.
It's still free, let's say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we have already prepared some stays of Christmas in the last minute,” said the director of Ingtours Petr Schifert.
The Vrchlabi Tourism Agency can also propose the New Year in Krkronoše, but there are fewer places.
The first quarters of February also go well, the remaining winter stays are sold averagely.
This year, the interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is not always weak in Krkronoše.
People's waiting for her to cut down.
No one wants to pass the winter to the mountain without darkness.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete," Schiffert thinks.
Instead, the Orizont Hotel occupation in Pec Pod Snśkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of almost five per cent.
We remain some last places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the Janvier holidays of Poland and Fevrier also sell well," reports Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel is near the central Yanské Láznś hotel also completed to twenty percent during the New Year period.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain empty to Christmas in the most recent Yanské Láznå hotel.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of Janvier, where we have already seven percent of occupation at the current time.
Feb is a little lower for the moment, but since the neighbouring goes down, the interest for staying in the Krkronoše will certainly grow the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, the Krkronoše hotels do not need to expect more snow.
Thursday, it will be more featuring and if there are precipitations, they should be neglected in the mountain.
But afterwards, the time should be renewed, report Jiśí Jakubský from the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repeating is the mother of wisdom
It is even comic, the effort that Barack Obama, President of the Reputation of Wisdom, renewed the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, that he would consider himself as a simple.
When he ended to let his doctrine overseas so warmly waiting, he noticed that he had collected him to the carbon paper since the Irak scenario of Bush three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "comme in Iraq," he has not hesitation, which is, moreover, to use the title of the Bush speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road in advance"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea to send new reliefs to an Iraqi consumed by civil war as "unresponsive and catastrophic decision in his consequences".
However, the following months showed that Bush's strategy, which was called by the campaign commanders' recommendations, was the only possible and potential success to such a point that journals at the present time did not speak of all Iraq.
This has not improved the reputation of Bush, which said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a well-favorable final situation that could not be expected.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will play
These are again the campaign commanders who requested him an increase in the military contingent, including the army commander of the Afghan Operation, General Stanley McCristal, who has even severely criticized the retreats of the White House, despite subordination habits.
He asked 40,000 men to make the most favorable situation.
The President has hesited for three months, but without a better option, at least 100,000 soldiers.
He succeeded to extend the promise of 5000 additionals from Europe, even though it was 10 000 out of the origin.
What leads to the most problems in the entire Obama strategy seems to be its intention to remove the Afghan armies from this 18 months and to end this process of three years. All Obama doctrines bring more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubts that half increases will bring the same fruit as progress in Iraq.
Despite frastrious wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well-organized, and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the opposite effect - no person can be taken into account and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, used to change the day-day leader.
The political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only powder in the eyes behind which the ethnical relationships of patriarch.
It is uniquely complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups, taking into account the lack of clarity of reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "speaking state", which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The temporary horizon of the Obama Strategy makes it perplex from its voluntaryism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghan has only been empowered and is currently on the board of the chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent in the torch of the war for their "approximately return to the house" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, the definition of a date for the retirement of the troops is absolutely irresponsible because the Talibans will consider it as the indirect defect of the United States.
The Latest Summit of the NATO showed that the will of the Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghan is oriented to the negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their electors what security in Germany or Italy is linked to war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can rarely affect the situation is the evolution of Iran's related events.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions have no effect on Iran, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of solving the problem by means of military force.
For example, it should be answered at the time that, according to Obama, America will come to the victory retreat of the Afghan troops.
However, every solution of this type will lead to dramatic return of the Afghan situation.
The only calm for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore still remains enough to plan on a new strategy, where it would be a total feasibility.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders will not receive liquid money primes
High-leading employees from the American Goldman Sachs will not receive this year of seed prize.
The company announced it to react to the strong critics of its salary practices.
The group of 30 main leaders will receive actions instead of money, which they will not be able to return for five years.
Actions may be removed to leaders if they would be too risked.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is a file head of the efforts to connect rewards with long-term performances in Wall Street.
I think that Wall Street is well aware of the global sense we need to take, indicated the former investor Douglas Elliott of the JPMorgan company
The concern is found in details, has added.
The Goldman Sachs bank has become the goal of criticism after being put about 17 billion dollars for prizes on the first three quarters of this year.
For the present year, the total amount of premises would probably exceed $20 billion, despite the today announced measure, according to the Reuters Agency.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the strong premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political subject in many countries.
The Great Britain announced merger that it was counted to affect a single tax of 50% of the banking shops more than 25,000 books.
France prepares similar measures.
In this year, women obtained Nobel prices in all horrible fields
These are five women, a number of records, who received today in Stockholm's hands of the king of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave Nobel prices in technical and literature disciplines.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer Herta Müller.
Two American Biologists, Elizabeth Victoria and Carol Greider received with their companion Jack Szostak the Nobel Medical Price for their Chromosomes Research.
The chemistry price was decreased to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishhan and Thomas Steitz to have cleared the structure and function of ribosome
The last lauréat received the Nobel economic price, the American Elinor Ostrom with her companion, Williamson, for their analysis of the economic governance.
The only technical discipline that has not been laured this year was physical.
This price has been delivered to scientists Charles Kao for their research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their inventation of CCD pools, which are currently based on all digital, fax or astronomic photos.
Each lauréat received the diploma, Nobel Medaille and the Pecuniary Reward certificate.
This reached ten million Swedish corones in each category. (It was about 1,1 million euros)
If one of them includes several laurates, they will share the reward between them.
The very expected Nobel price of peace has already been transferred to Oslo in Norway to President Barack Obama.
This, in his speech, recognized the controversial nature of his reward because it is only at the beginning of his course and it is also the head of a country involved in two wars in Iraq and Afganistan.
He added to his policy that war is essential in certain situations to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota intends to dismiss. Klaus invited him to Chasseau
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance of Eduard Janota on Friday morning, which put his stay to the Government on the basis of its dealing with the State budget for the next year as voted by the Chamber of Members
It is estimated that the budget and may also be the position of Janota to the office will be on the agenda for them on Thursday.
Claus also critical the budget.
According to him, deficit is too important, which is more than the crisis of public finance.
This is the presidential door, Radin Ochvat, who informed the meeting.
Then Janota wants to discuss on his function on Monday with the first Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation which will be subjected to the signing of Klaus, it is a deficit of 163 billion corones that the Czech Republic should be managed.
However, the Chamber of Members was valuable to mere the left proposals on money transfers and increased the payment of staff, the functioning of social services and the direct payments to farmers.
The Government reaffirmed the proposals of democratic socials that they would indirectly increase the deficit of the budget.
For this reason, a violent dispute is born between the left of one side, the Government, Klaus and the right of the other part, a degree in which it dealt with the future of the Fisher Office, which was formed by agreement between the ODS, the SSD and the Green Party.
The critics argued that the budget, as voted by the deputy, removes the package of economic measures passed by the Government of Fisher and which must, according to it, end up the State's detention.
Klaus, who is able to ratifie the State budget law but not obliged it today at a small weekend of discussions with entrepreneurs, said that policies have long denounced the "serial problem" of the "unrespectable deficiency" of public finances.
Now there is no favourable solution, according to him.
Only a strong government could improve, if it could support a broader consensus of the political parties, according to the President.
The President of the ODS Mirec Topolánek stated that the budget is scared and that the Government should deem in question its future existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an Administrative Office supported by the SSD, the ODS and the Greens is not clearly working.
In his reaction, the first minister Fischer qualified such words of "drastic verdicts".
The chief of Jiśí Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the deficit of the budget prepared for this year by the former government of Topolanek is scared and will exceed 200 billion corones.
Mercredi already has successfully qualified the ratification of the State budget for the next year.
The People ' s Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new client Eastwood film
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans argued that the new film of Hollywood Invitus - Invaincu will exhibit many things in the world, its battles and their victories.
The story speaks of sports, relationships between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, the American Actor in Oscars, incarned Nelson Mandela's life film, unfavourable fighting against the racist regime of the Apartment in South Africa and the first black President.
Freeman said that it's a 40-11-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him, "If I have to incarn you, I should be able to see you personally..
The age of seventy-two years of age, which was rewarded of a price for his role in the Millennium Dollar Bay of Clint Eastwood, located in the box, was, for example, incarcerated the leader of a movement against slavery itself, a firm president of the United States, even even God in the film Evan All Power, but never a person of living and an important fear for such people that Mandela is.
The former South African State man was prisoned for 27 years of his work in favour of the end of the apartment in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was decreased the Nobel Peace price.
Invitus is a Latin meaningful word invainc and it is the title of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the real history of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the Captain of the South African Ruby Team to unify the country. President Mandela newly elected that his country remains still and was always rationally and economicly divided after the apartment.
It is convinced to be able to join his people through sport and decide to join the Ruby players who are among the foreigners worldwide.
The South African team will end by progressing in the world Coupe in 1995.
Freeman has worked for a few years to bring Mandela's story on a large screen.
I had no other purpose to play this role in order to draw closer to the reality, said Freeman.
The greatest challenge for me was sure to talk like him
The actor stated that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would try to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be in cold before his speech.
The most important for him was to shut his hand.
I realized that when I shut your hand, I get your energy, she's transferred and I was impressed to know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienar, the capital of a national ruby team in which there are most white players.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare a role in the hard medium of the ruby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I sounded at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I told to Francois Pienar was: "I looked much larger in the film."
Despite the differences between the actors and real models, Invitus under the wood of Eastwood realisator received positive opinions and even the ambitions for the Oscars are spoken.
The criticy of films Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety reported its appreciation in these words: "This is a very good story, a very well done film."
In film evaluations on the Rotentomatoes.com site, Invitus received 76 per cent of positive appreciations.
The mystery of aura in Norway is resolved: Russians tested a smoke
A strange light phenomenon was observed above Norway.
The Russian Defence Ministry has recognized that it had tested an inter-continental balistic fusion not far away from the Norwegian borders.
However, the lancement was still a failure and the "Bulava" missile that was to be the pride of the Russian army progressively becomes the castle of Russian generals and the first Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated during the fusion tests did not have the expected effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava hasn't been bound, or it has been shocked in full flight.
The Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "missil that doesn't want"
A missile that doesn't want but who slights
This 13th test was normally started.
It's just the end of the flight that there are again disgates on the device.
This is clearly the engine of the third stage of the fuse that explosed.
This time, "Bulava" was engaged in the submarine Dmitri Donskij, which shipped under the White Sea surface.
This type of mixture can just be put on the fire of an embarking in movement and strike
This is why the mysterious light above Norwegia caused by an unidentified object exactly has been truely by a defectuous "Bulava".
On the other hand, the Norwegians did not give a moment that it is a Russian fuse.
Generals argue that this time, we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two stages of the smoke resisted and the shooting touched only the third.
In the previous cases, engines have known difficulties at the first stage.
Although no test launch has occurred, the Department of Defence considers that only six over three have failed.
This success rate of about 50% is therefore involved by the generals of optimism, and therefore they always claim that a day "Bulava" will want to be a problem and that it will even bring ten hypocritical nuclear nucleus to a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Fetissov signed a year contract with CSKA Moscow in 51 years
Legendary Defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again be presented in a professional game at 51 years.
The former world's champion, olympical champion and detentor of Stanley Cup will handle his CSKA Moscow's team in the need and will probably make its entry in the Monday Search against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who finished his career for forty years in 1998, is timely the CSKA President.
After Denis Kuliash's blessure, we need a other defender.
Fetissov is regularly conducted and agrees to help the team.
We still need a few details on the form, declares the coach of the Sergey Nyemtchnov club, quoted by the AP Agency.
It was not specified if the comeback of the hockey player is only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of the other players, said Nyemtchnov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the glass, Fetissov is thus the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the Legendary attacking Gordoe Howe played a whole season for Hartford and reached 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famous five-year-old Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those who have the best success.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union, he doubled the gold to the Olympic Games, seven world champion titles, he triumphed to Canada Cup as well as the June World Championship.
In the second part of his carriage, he also collected the males in NHL where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He is a member of the Hockey Temple since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancel all the additional hours
The direction of the Hyundai factor of Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional hours.
It is just because of additional hour that the trademarks declared a state of emergency in Monday.
Petr Vanśk's parlor, Hyundai, confirmed it.
However, the direction wishes to continue to agree with the trade unions on the summer this year.
We cannot reject our production plan, it is essential, therefore, that further voluntary hours have been proposed on Saturday, 19 December, and that there were two teams, stated Vanśk.
The Sedmička.cz site stated that the company proposed a bonus 400 Czech Koreans to the employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be allocated to poster for the working day on November 28.
The company, according to Vanśk, decided to change the way to move its employees in exchange of additional hours.
If they receive the supplement for more hours, or they can make a replacement chair on December 28 and thus extend their final yearly feasts indicated by Vanśk.
In addition, all present workers will receive compensation for transport costs and for their dinner.
In view of the fact that additional hours were the most urgent and the warmest point in the comments and reliefs of tradeers as employees who spontaneously stopped the production last week, the direction took the immediate decision to cancelle all additional hours for the month of December, stated Vanśk.
By the last week, the employees of the car industry were forced to work almost daily two additional hours over eight hours.
Syndicates are able to cancel the state of greenland after the signing of the Agreement.
The next negotiation between the direction of the car and the trade unions must have been held on Friday after midday.
The Sindical Chief Petr Kuchaś declared Monday that they were willing to stop the state of grief in case of agreement on their revendications and signature of a common document.
The situation in the manufacture culminated last mercury when nearly 400 employees were spontaneously slaughtered because of inadequate additional hours.
They also protested against the bad conditions of wage and for abortion.
The direction was defended by the fact that employees had to work additionally to comply with the imperatives in the field of automobile production.
When the advertisement of the Monday Great, the tradeers also requested that employees who had stopped the production are not subject to any sanctions.
Syndicates request the company to reduce the past time in additional hours at least.
Moreover, they want a reward of $5,000 corones (209 per € approximately) for these.
Hyundai de Nošovice is currently employed by 2 000 people.
It started the production in series in November last year.
It produced about 80,000 vehicles up to September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on HIV virus also
A team of Czech and German scientists tests new combinations that can raise HIV virus proliferation in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also affects viruses that have already developed immunity to medicines.
In some cases, this reality takes the fact that combination does not so intensely affect the current variants of the virus, as well as certain medicines already available.
It is not possible to curate AIDS at the current time.
However, the life of diseases can be radically extended through a mix of medicines that prevent HIV virus multiplication in the body.
However, their consumption causes a series of secondary effects.
Moreover, the repression of this multiplication has the effect of what is called resistant viruses on which medicines have no more effect.
The work of the experts of three institutions, the Scientific Academy of the Republic of Czech Republic, the Czech Republic of Prague and the Heidelberg University opens the way to face the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metamarbolans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV virus.
The metabolisms are a assembly of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all medicines that have been used until now, and this is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researcher's work leads them to discover new "enhanced substances", based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their connections with virus proteins.
Metamarbolans have a three-dimensional structure: two paris boxes are formed by the bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metalic atom, in this case cobalt.
A virus trailer and resistant.
HIV protection is a protein of HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of virus.
Without the division of HIV virus caused by HIV protection, there would have been no birth of infectious mature parts of the virus.
If HIV protection is stopped, the proliferation of the virus in the body of the patient will also be stopped, explaining researchers in a press communication published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemia of the Scientific Academy of the Czech Republic.
In their works published in the Scientific Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (cf. table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in tests as well as on the resistant variants obtained in HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metamarbolans is not so strong as on clinical medicines, but it does not require the existing versions against which current medicines are often inefficient.
The metamarbolans, with their unique action mechanism and their other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting to investigate more towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, said Pavlinna śáčováva, directorate of the structural biologic laboratory of organic and biological chemical institute and the institution of the molecular genetics of the science Academy.
A debate around the budget. ODS takes it to Fisher, which defends
The Chairman of the ODS (Democratic Citizen Participation), Miek Topolánek qualified the ratificated budget for the next year and according to him, the Government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should return to its existence in question.
The first Minister has qualified the proposals of the Drastic Green ODS.
He said to take time to analyze.
The ODS Petr Nečas's speaking port stated that the idea of a administrative office supported by the SSD, the ODS and the Green Party was not clearly more functioning.
According to Nečas, the Head of Government should decide whether it is in the House of Deputy Support on minority that is concerned to fight the growing deficit, or if it is concerned to remain in his functions with the support of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of ODS and democratic socials in relation to public deficiencies are diagnosticly opposed.
The Chamber of Members has ratified the budget for 2010, but the proposals for up to 12 billion crowns included.
The Chamber increased the money for staff payments, the functioning of social services and the direct payments to farmers.
The Government's grief towards the proposals of democratic socials was the fact that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion corones.
The ODS left the room before the vote, obeying the Government ' s desire as a changed budget is less bad than an interim budget.
Deception and inutility
The Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of disrespect and feeling of inutility, the first Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still reflect the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave his functions in the case of ratification of amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota took you Monday with the Prime Minister after his transition to the Government:
He indicated at the same time that he asked whether he would remain in his functions.
It is the reason for negotiations around the budget.
If fisher decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the SSD, which have imposed budget changes, do not have their place in the Government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that it will be dismissed if the Chamber ratifies the other laws that increase the deficit, such as those affecting disease, retreatment, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolanek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
It's the case of the Head of the Fisher government and the whole government.
The Ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing to prejudice, emphasized Topolánek in a textual communication from the United States.
He recalled that the Vice-Ministers of certain ministers claimed to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas emphasized that if Fisher decided to give his demission to the fact that it was struggled against the deficit of public finance, " it's absolutely logical and correct that it is based on the left majority that is currently at the Chamber " .
This says, it must not wait for support and tolerance of democrats.
I have not been thinking about it and once it will be on the agenda then I will be dedicated to it, said from the Chamber to the journalists, the Minister of Defence of Martin Bartak, elected to the government just by the democrats.
The first Minister Fisher took place in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS has walked back at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas emphasized at the same time that the ODS probably would have voted merely against the amended budget if it had not expressly requested the Democratic Members to allow the budget to vote.
We do not have the feeling of being orphelins, aren't we little children, has it reacted to the question of whether the ODS had not been reproduced from the President of the Party in the Chamber or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I did not note that my vote would be wrong.
I had already known at the time I rejected my mandate that what would follow in the next months would be a chamber of the Chamber and a destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek reacted to anyone.

Regional trains are commanded by the regions who pay for them by total eight billion in the next year, as the State will be involved in almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more cherished.
Railways again signed a contract for ten years, until now the period was still one year.
Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not return to a price increase in the large majority of transport titles.

The rebellious rebellion remains more than 50 persons, children have been abandoned
The rebels today took 75 people south of the Philippians, among which some students from a primary school and their institutes.
It's the AFP Agency who informed it, but talked about the origin of 65 days only.
17 children were left after eight hours, as well as one of the institutions.
The opposition took place in the province of Southern Agusan.
It is reported that about 19 rebellies have been used as human bottlers when the police flee.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of remaining detainees.
According to the AFP Agency, rebellies belong to the New Popular Army (NPA), which is the Communist Party of the Philips (CPP).
According to the AFP Agency, the police first continued the rabbiners after violence caused by a accounting regulation between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao south of the Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23, which were linked to the elections of the Governor's administration, there were 30 journalists.
The Governor of this province of the South Filipinas was arrested after assaults of massacre participation, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influenced band of Ampatu.
The Mindanao Island also includes active muslim separators.
However, these have renewed peace talks with the Cuban Government.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new Hollywood film of Clint Eastwood arrives in the United States rooms in the next days, the title is Invitus (the official title of Czech is Invitus: Neporaśenī), and born a part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fighter against the worldly-known apartment was returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen for years by Mandela himself for incarnation.
The second male role of the South African legenda Champion Champion was allocated to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in rooms, critics and public returns are heard.
Direct pressure on that. It's okay, it's okay. Let me see it.
On June 18, 1918, he was born in Mvezu in South Africa.
In 1988 he obtained the Sakharov price for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace price at the side of Klerk.
He was President from South Africa 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes because it is presented at a moment where South Africa is in full preparation for the cutting of the football world, and on the other hand, because the media are affected by new concerns about the increased racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants from the black majority of the power.
According to the AP Agency, the reactions to the new film are at the time very positive in South Africa, despite the frequencies reserves issued to the main roles in which Hollywood stars are "passing".
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the film by re-examining his own terms.
I rejoiced of this role for years and I was well prepared.
I have also continued to meet Nelson Mandela personally for power - as we say - to recover energy, did he indicate at the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think that's a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember the personality and message of Mandela through the film.
It's the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each person who has joined it.
Put the maillot from the National Rurby Team
The film based on the history of the Roman of the British writer John Carlin was freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room that gave his creation to the people depends on the South African defender of human rights during his term to the presidency.
Morgan Freeman therefore tries to collect two racial groups of a long-divised population, and as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he entered the national maillot of the South African team on the shame of the world, which then had reported South Africa.
To be shown on the skin in maillot, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been long-term staged over the white public over the past 14 years ago and was recognized by the white people.
We hope that the football championship will be successful to join people again in a single nation, reported the player of Chester Williams, who was the only "noir" of the national team in 1995.
It is still to see whether the tendency of the South African situation will improve.
The South African whites, however, are sceptics like it recently confided in a holding for LN Christopher Dawson, a ruby fan who went to the Great Britain.
The Championnat started on 11 June 2010.
A valuant transformer of tens of millions of flame corones in the Louny region
A fire rose in the morning a transformer of the company in the distribution center near the town of Vøškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the portal of Usti pompiers, there are six units that worked on the fire.
They were counted to let the transformer become consumer, but they reviewed their opinion and extend the fire with a mixture of water, museum and a special substance.
The cause is a technical default, a short-circuit of the transformer.
No one has been damaged and according to Pavla Mandatova's speech, the incident does not risk the safe function of the whole transmission.
The damages are estimated to a few decades of millions of corones, the exact number may be known once the end is fired.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new.
It acknowledges that in ten years of activity, the company Šeps has not known anything likely and that the incidents of this type are isolated.
The current electrical supply has not been interrupted, declares the parliamental port of the ΒEZ company for the North Sośa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industry has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. śeps is the exclusive operator on the Czech territory of the transmission assemblies and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It was renewed, renewed and developed 39 distribution posts with 67 converters transfering electric energy from the transport assemblies to distribution assemblies and line tracks of a width of 4339 km.
Jančura will take complaint for dismissing against three SSD prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of the University of Students, is going to make a complaint today for dismissing against three democratic social preferences.
Concretely against Michal Hašek in the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region, and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesaśík.
Jančura stated it in Dvacet minutes from Radioṣṭurnal.
The complaint is linked to the attempt of the company to explore regional flow routes in certain regions.
However, all regions have been concluded by signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claimed that the ends are done, while only a offer was made for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we're more cherish than the Czech iceways that is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that have been signed last week.
So there's only to defend us.
This is in exchange of calamities on the University Agency, said Jančura at Radiośurnal.
He also stated that there have been evidence that no region has been done in accordance with European law.
We will prepare for this a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that the complainant deposit by Mr. Jančura represents the follow-up of his mediat spectacle that serves to him free advertising for his society and for his person.
I am very willing to defend my name and name of my region, and I call the other preferences to do the same.
I believe that this will be the opportunity to clearly show that it is just Mr. Jančura who manipules public opinion and reiterates false and false arguments on regional rail transport, says Haschek.
Jančura has already informed the last week that he will invest some million corones in an advertising that will mention the defavorable ways of the regions.
He declared to Radioōurnal that he will break the campaign after Christmas and that he will take it back after the New Year.
He explained that the campaign will see corruption in a wide sense.
Jančura undertaked its campaign after the regions agreed to engage in the Czech Railways in the exploitation of rail links for an order of approximately 150 billion corones, without calling for offers.
According to Jančura, such a way of action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to Jančura to the threats of a Member of SSD.
The only threat was that if we weren't left, we could lose our bus license.
He has been presented as a deputy of ŠSSD, I don't know who it is, but I will not say his name, said Jančura today in radiournal.
The vaccination against pneumonics will be free and optional
The vaccination against pneumonics will turn the old habitats since Janvier.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are votes already, saying that a binding vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against culminant pneumonics.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already defines the maximum prices that will pay disease insurances for vaccines.
Experts also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for the children of August.
Since January, the children born last year from 2 August may be vaccinated freely against pneumonics.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If the vaccination has been started last year or later, the following vaccinations should be paid itself.
The first vaccine dose should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year, a fourth family voluntary vaccinated his children against pneumonics.
However, the parents paid 1600 corones even more for a dose.
The vaccination of young people requires four doses.
Specialists believe that disease insurance depends on 300 to 450 000 corones in vaccine doses each year.
However, they recognise medical care that non-vacuated children need.
To date, the State costs about 5000,000 corones per year for all the children's vaccination.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
The pneumonics are the cause of median ear inflammation but also of serious infections including mine inflammation and blood infections.
According to hospital surveys, there is up to 28 children under 10 years of age caused by pneumonic infections.
Besides the Czech Republic, some 40 other countries introduced the remboursed vaccination.
Is vaccination binding?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation for the future.
From Janvier, it must be regulated by the insurance and the validity.
For example, the President of the Nalas Rudolf Kalovský Association indicated that a binding vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long been promoting vaccination against pneumonics.
In an international conference to which our association has participated, experts have not been really satisfied by the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
That's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have put this at least.
I think it's a direction that we need to follow now, said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination process against pneumonics.
We do not consider it absolutely for the moment, declared his call Vlastimil Mšeś.
Facultative vaccination has its inconvenience, as a result of the doctors.
Hana Cabrnochova, President of the Pediatrist Society, recognizes that a vaccination based on the voluntary deficiencies.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered a decrease of vaccination renewment "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision to make the optional vaccination", said Cabrnochov.
Specialists expect that more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccine their food since the next year.
The vaccination against pneumonics marks a rupture of the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is financed by insurances and not by the State.
Cabrnochov explains that insurance should be freed for prevention funds, and they would thus be economized about future medical care.
Doctors should buy their own products
However, this is related to the concerns of practitional pediatrists, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to purchase vaccines by insurance, and doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccines provided by the State.
Some Members, however, feared that this would allow insurance to "deduce disease insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurances to repay them.
According to estimates, pediatrists should individually invest some 40 000 corones per month in vaccines, which is a major amount.
It'll be far away, according to Cabrnochova.
The son of an American artist involved in a Museo Wolf
The son of Frank Frazetta, recognised example, was accused of trying to steal tables for a value of $20 million (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, the police said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interrupted while he was loaded 90 tables in his vehicle and a retreat.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical skin to strengthen the entry of the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81 years old, is famous for his designs of personalities such as Conan le Barbara and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press Agency.
AP mentioned a police officer that the young Mr. Frazetta could have been motivated by a family girl.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52 years old, claimed to have been authorized by his father to "entree in the museum for any means to transport the tables into a storage installation", reported the Agency.
Mr. Frazetta Senior never had given such a authorisation, said the Agency.
Labour defends the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defend tax increases and reductions in expenditure announced in the pre-Budget report, despite the criticism of opposition, enterprises and trade unions.
Tories stated that Alistair Darling "a lacked opportunity to show that it was serious to the deficit reduction by reporting its decisions to the elections.
The Chairman also touched the crowds by attacking low salary and average salary.
Among its main proposals, a increase of 0.5 per cent of the Social Assistance and a low rate of 1 per cent on public salary since 2011.
The angry of social insurance
The unions protested that the low wages are penalized by a recession which they are not responsible and made up that "problems" were announced.
The reduction of the social insurance, which will enable about 3 billion GBP per year, has set the world of firms in angry, as it says, is a job tax while the objective should be a relaxing of the economy.
The increase, reserved to those who win more than 20,000 GBP per year, will touch about 10 million employees.
POINTS PRINCIPUX OF THE PRE-BUDGET RAPPORT
Social insurance will still increase 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will be more than 4.75% expected this year
New tax of 50% on banking shops
The increase in the tax on benefits of society for small companies has been abandoned
Rabais of electric vehicle taxes and eolians
Augmentation of 2,5% retreats
According to the Tresor estimates, a person who wins 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person wins 40,000 GBP will lose 190 GBP, while a person wins 10,000 GBP by a winner of 110 GBP more.
Ministers said that their aim to reduce half of the deficit before 2013 was "faciliar decisions" but stressed that 60 per cent of the load of additional taxes would amount to the first 5 per cent of the employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretariat in the Tresor, reaffirmed a increased tax increase and stressed that a reduction in the expenditure was a "water bottle in the ocean" in relation to what was needed.
"They are important. They will allow us to divide by two the deficit, which will be absolutely essential in the next four years," he said to the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was reliable and that the growth of the economy would be restarted at the end of the year.
However, the previsions of the Labour on economic growth - which will influence the amount it should take and the speed to which the deficit will be combined - were doubted after the Chairman was obliged to review its first figures.
In its allocation, he said that the economy would probably decrease from 4.75 per cent in this year - well worse than 3.5 per cent decreased in April - while the refund would be more than 3 billion GDP than pre-sumed.
"Opportunity missed"
The Conservators who will start this Thursday a new advertising campaign against the "debt crisis" of the Labour claimed that the project to employ 789 billion GBP in the next six years was not viable.
The Ministers did not have a credible plan on the way to repay, added, "cynically" of difficult choices towards elections, which must be held in June 2010.
"They did nothing significantly about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, head-secret at the Fantastic Championer. "They had the opportunity to do it, and they missed it."
" The major advertisements will be made after the elections, except the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloite
The Labour stressed that schools, hospitals and police will be protected by the following reductions, in contrast with the tory proposals that would lead to a rapid and significant deficit reduction.
But Lib Dems stated that the money collected through tax increase and expenditure would be used to support the expenditure of the next year and not to reduce the deficit, supporting the plans "building on the wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC's Political Editor, argued that the calendar of advertisements - such as the increase in inflation for some benefits of invalidity in April next, mentioned above - would leave the Chairperson to face propaganda accusities, the money was simply recovered in the next year.
However, the Labour stressed that additional assistance is provided while people are the most necessary and that the situation will be revised in September 2010.
"False budgets"
Although the Ministers did not publish the expenditure details by 2011, economicists said that it was clear that the restrictions of public expenditure would not begin to feel only at a medium term.
The very respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Instituto of Fiscal Education) stated that the possibility figures in the future involve substantial reductions in many areas, including potentially transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is only reported," his Director, Robert Chote, said.
"The most important advertising will be made after the elections, without any winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser at Deloite's accounts.
"This was a false pre-budgetary report, and the markets are well taken into account."
The FBI investigation on "Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI arrest investigation of five American reporters, suspected by extreme links.
Men were arrested at a raid house in Sarhoda in the Eastern Province of Punjab, announced the American Embassy in Pakistan, the BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether it was the same man who had been declared that they had been lost from their home in the American State of Virginia last month.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States said that it will also search for information on those persons.
Three of them are presented as the ascendence of Pakistan, one Egyptian heritage and the other of the Jemenite.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would want to know what the accusions are against them and in what conditions they are detained," said the speaker, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI's portal, stated that the Agency had known arrests and that she was in contact with the families of lost students.
"We cooperate with the Pakistani authorities in order to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if they really are students who are missed," she says.
The embassy of Pakistan in Washington stated that men were arrested in a house belonging to one of them.
It said that the house was already supervised by the local police and that no accusions had yet been sentenced against the arrested men.
The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, rejected all comments on arrests, reported the Press Agency Reuters, but she stated that the United States should "cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to delay the terrorism infrastructure that continues to be recruited and formed."
The five students were lost from their home by their families, in North Virginia, at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns the "abus" of Iran
In the past twenty years, human rights have been so little respected as ever, according to the Amnesty International Association report.
the report presents the "repeatings of violations" by the regime, before and after the presidential election campaign of June.
A man referred to in the report stated that he was struck and burned with smokes, and another said that he was threatened by violence.
Iran rejected the previous criticism of the non-respect of human rights.
The authorities argued that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and twelve were killed in Iran after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinjad has conducted the largest public manifestations since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Twenty-five were sentenced to prison penalties and lawyers claim that at least five persons were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, from the BBC in Teheran, now states that at the beginning of protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, said our correspondant.
"Fussed condemnation."
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Abraham Mehtari, who was accused of working with the Facebook networks and protesting against the results of the election.
"They often touched me to the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the sight, on the head... they threatened me to execute and humilize me."
After five days, he signed a false condemnation and was released and left in the street, always in blood and half-consciousness, said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate losing elections, Mehdi Karroubi, stated that detented manifestants were tortured to die in prison and that others were violent.
Iranian authorities rejected the accused of violence, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of an older detention who said he was closed in a container with 75 other persons, over eight weeks, in a centre of detention in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary would create a Committee to investigate post-electoral problems and the Government's response, but she stated that the mandate and powers of these bodies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 persons were arrested in the past three weeks in order to prevent other manifestations.
ski pistes built in the park of the city
More than 100 tons of artificial nest was used to transform the Bristol site into a competitive track.
The eventPist in the Park (A piste in the park) acquired 16 skiers and semi-professional skiers in competitive prices.
On the top of the Brandon Hill park, a small tremplin preceding a 100m long track.

It's a wonderful view, with all the lights of the city skining in contrabass.
There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders of the country - of real talents", he added.
Prices rewarded the best voltile - or figures made on the track.
After the Thursday evening, the nest will be left to the source.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Laïc State.
Roger Bootle, Deloite
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the last book of the author, "Why the Frenchers do not like the fould" (2006), a elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country since a fifth years and whose effects are still feeling today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen presents a very broader and ambitious trace.
Good anthropology, he is not only wanting to know what political and media say about Islam in France but what happens now in the country.
It has been over a few months in the museums, schools and institutions that now provide in France as Mr. Bozen calls "moslim spaces" for the 5m-6 m of Muslims.
It is very well to listen to and to the discussions between teachers and students on the issues of them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a matrix (or both)?
Should the development and the rights of homosexuals be taught to young musulmans?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-musulman?
Can a Muslim use a banking system based on interests to obtain a loan?
These are practical problems, and it affirms, which are the daily lot, rather than the political drames that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of images, teachers and intellectual, all unknown public, except Tariq Ramadan, a Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern lay society.
They do not have the debate until the end.
Conservers do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectualists and activists who have been interviewed by Mr Bowen are generally agreed with their lawyers of a Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia, who are a small part of Europe's musulmans.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the French law could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He asked how many French politicians (and the intellectual guard election so virulent of laïcity) are truly undertaken towards pluralism.
According to him, the Muslims have not been managed, in relation to Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make historical commitments with the Lay Republicanism.
Before a growing pragmatism, he detects a "strong of key values".
Is Islam may be French? After reading this book, it is tried to say "Yes, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and dramaticly than any other place on the planet.
The glass that composed is being found at an alarming speed, bringing with her a life that can't survive anywhere.
The oil, gas, expeditions and fishing are shipped into new open waters with diplomas, lawyers, and now writers in their sillage.
In "On a ice sleeves of glass," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, draws a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the Poland smile.
Aware of the history and the complicated fishing policies in the ballet, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic operators who made their evidence by chasing the white skin.
The meeting of the Amiral Nelson, then courageous 14-year-old, who had not to fight that the point of his mosquet, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young horns, captured when they were born at the side of their mother, all right killed, were touched and sent into zoos and circles.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous spectacle gathered 75 ours at the same time.
Even today, the sizes of a zoo are generally a million of the surface required to adults in freedom. The climate is rarly indicated: a polar snake in Singapore has become green because of the snakes that pooled in its breast.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historic people and often returns to the threat that the chasors of the survival of species.
Despite the bans in Norway, America and Russia, the murderers continue in Groenland and Canada where helicopters and Indians in Motoski use powerful shooting shocks to catch their likers.
Ironically, it's in the most northern waters of these two chase nations that the glass will remain as long as long as.
In his new book, Alun Anderson, an elderly editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and expensive summary of the Arctic science and a captive view of what may be the future below.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherics nor oceanographs can precisely relate the speed of change.
It's not necessary to try.
Finally, the 19th and early XXear, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneer travellers gave the first information about the source of the glass calotte.
The submarins of the cold war then carded the relief changes under that.
Satellite monitors and sounds on the ironbergs are a great help, but the largest work is made by enduring men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson observes the extraordinary and small world of the arctic glass tribute system, formed by the saumâtre water files pressed by ice.
But from the ear above the microscopical wonders contained in the glass, everything will be lost with the disappearing of the summer glass, prescribed between 2013 and 2050.

Marines, among the 60,000 people who put horns on the storms in Arlington
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19-year-old, made a trip of seven hours in bus to put a simple coron on the tomb of a soldier who had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Caroline at the Arlington National Cemetery Cimetière to decorate the storms, this day was dedicated to welcome men and women who, one day, were at their place.
In a few months, where we're sent, we're risking to be their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If this happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered on Saturday morning to put corons on the tents of the veterans, in different sections of Arlington Ceremony's cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, in Maine, launched the commemoration and other people decided to decorate several hundreds of pumps in Arlington Ceremony's ceremony cemetery.
Now, to continue a 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen are traveling every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize memories for military and victims of terrorism.
Worcesters also found a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other States.
This year, volunteers put more than 16,000 corones on the hills of Arlington cemetery around Pentagone, on the cemetery of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the memory site for the victims of the United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given more than $1500,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years of age of Westminster, said she had traveled to Arlington in the honor of her husband, a deceived carriage military.
Although his husband wasn't entered in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gest was a way to thank those who were sacrificed.
It's a small geste that can make citizens to support our troops, says she.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Emmitted in several warm clothes, volunteers marketed between the smells and the extensive smells of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen old cemeteries from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam war, because they are not often visited as new tumbles, declared organizers.
Humur was at the optimism, while children played and the couples were standing through the hand, taking the sweet pin corners on the green tombs.
Each round corner had a red red color, with a small red papillon on the top.
It was closely planning the silence on Section 60, where most of the war veterans were inhumanized in Iraq and Afganistan.
The United Service Organization gave 1,000 corones to develop the section, but the shadow humor of the current wars implied the area.
People cry without hiding themselves, others prayed, and families and friends supported themselves in the cold air.
Some read the names in the stone with high voice while others were shocked to see the small black and white information cards, covered in the humid land for those who had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in laugh, on the throat of his son.
She's part of Zanesfield, in Ohio, and had led eight hours to come together on the gate of Marine Gunnery David Shane Spicer, died at the battle in July.
No one should never forget for what we're free... my son paid for this, did she say.
"A long time after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
A American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban Government arrested an American citizen who distributed mobile phones and computers in the country, claimed the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Alternative Development Inc., based on Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as USS Agency for International Development and World Bank.
Consulting authorities as well as United States Interest Section in La Havane tried to have access to the detention arrested on 5 December.
The accurate accusities have not been made public, although the Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under pretext of being "fearing".
All activities of the revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-governmental graphics and speech are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a community of bigger bloggers, conducted by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentary who often writes about the way they are married and they are followed and harced by government agents.
Sánchez made several requests to leave the country to go for rewards, but authorisations have always been rejected.
The detention of an American resident may increase the tensions between the Communist Government of Brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that continues to be a "douce approach" to improve the relationship with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times, Thursday night.
The new American policy emphasizes that the Cuban Government continues through concrete steps, such as liberating political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, so that the United States can make it.
Mobile phones and portable computers are allowed to Cuba, although it is new and desired goods in a country or the average payment of a staff is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban Government has granted regular citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payment day.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in the luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country and in some government buildings such as universities.
Cubans who often want to connect themselves must communicate their name to the Government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of a American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the rarely incarcered Americans in Cuba are behind the barriers for drug trafficking such as, as Gloria Berbena, who was attached to the U.S. Interests Section in La Havane.
Berbena said she could not provide more information on arrest.
The arrest and detention are a great error.
An activity that, in any other open company, would be allowed - freely distributing mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the American Programme of Human Rights Watch Group, who recently published a serious report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba," which refers to Raul Castro's installation as a leader of the country to replace Fidel, his elderly brother.
According to Vivanco, a accused is often arrested, was sentenced and sentenced on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban Government often causes a negative response to the United States at the time when the two countries start to love a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent a compliment to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities had a planned organization to prepare a complaint to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying that this case would allow to demonstrate a major network of terrorist recruiters who are using the Internet to search for young people radicalized.
The investigators claimed that they had a hidden insurgent personality, known under the name of Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after finding them when one of them made comments on terrorist vagues on the YouTube video site.
In Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the reculated region of Pakistan's tribal ceinture, home from Al-Qaida and terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistani secret services that were informed about the case said that Saifullah did not convince Al-Qaida's commanders that these men did not participate in the CIA's compliance to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Indeed, they were isolated for days in the Eastern city of Sargodha, far from the banned mountains from the northeastern east became a refugee of terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities expressed the condition of maintaining the anonym as a result of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the authorisations required to obtain the entry into the Al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law forces.
The case of those five men, who remain in Pakistan and who are interrogated by the FBI, is stressing the crucial role of the recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps, more important, in the determination of persons with confidence.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the United States secret services have been priority to infiltrate men in the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of barriers, rejecting the entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may be shoes.
According to analysts, potential American recruitments are closely studied by Al-Qaida.
But they are also very touching for the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propagandary value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert on the NEFA Foundation, stated that terrorist groups should also be more attentioned, in the choice of people accepting the United States secret services, because they have become experts in respect of their recruiting methods.
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way to follow his recruit model as many others have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one more on the Internet.
Decades of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen request a "action" for climate
Decades of thousands of protesters have marketed on the streets, here, Saturday, demanding more important action on the climate of the negotiators working in the palace of the Bella Convention Center of the city.
The number of manifestants was estimated to 1000,000 people, but 25 000 according to the police estimates.
This event was relatively pacienced, although a small number of mass activists have led some explosives near a whole of government buildings, in the center of the city.
In the day when little things happened during the discussions on the United Nations climate sponsorized, thousands of activists marketed by the city, employing pancarts in English, saying, "No planet B" and one in Spanish, declaring "The Earth says that it's enough."
several celebrations were joined to protests, including the top model and photos of Denmark, Helena Christiansen, who stated that traveling to the country of his mother’s birth, the Peru opened his eyes on the desperate problems that the country must face because of the impact of climate changes already occur."
It's one of the reasons why I decided to join me to the great step -- to pass the word and to launch a call to the leaders of the whole world to take just, ambitious and compromised decisions, said it.
It is not a easy task, but it must be business, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the manifestants to be too close to the Bella centre and said that she had arrested 19 persons because they were taking a mask or that they were in possession of pockets.
The police prevented the manifestants to be too close to the Bella centre and said that she had arrested 19 persons because they were taking a mask or that they were in possession of pockets.
According to a passenger who asked to keep the anonymat because of its implication in climate debates, activists with black masks and clothing have leaked several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is around some ministers.
They launched them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first of the smokes, followed by "what great explosions".
In the Congress palace, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk throughout the middle.
But it seems that the manifestants could not wake up the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, whose representative of China for the climate.
When he asked if he thought that a manifestation would have a positive impact on international debates, he answered in English "In fact, that is something I did not have awareness.
Then he continued to Mandarin, saying: "The event is important, I can't hear what happens outside".
He noted that the walk could seem nervous or useful according to the perspectives.
It shows the interest of the large public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, said it.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they disappoint the freedom of others."
The results of tests show the tenses between races
The federal report of the last week on the mathematical results brought a good news to the public schools of Washington D.C.
Although the district remains far behind the head institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are much more progress in the two years previous than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is the last number of the National Educational Progress Assessment (National Assessment of Educational Progress) is the continuing difference between the results of African and white people at both local and national levels.
The average results of the white children of Grade 4 (cm1) at WashingtonD.C. in these two last years increased from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American councils only increased three points from 209 to 212.
The degree of success has actually increased from 2007 to 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Africans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, just one point, from 245 to 244.
The average result of whites was not included in test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view of a period of six years is not more encouraged.
In 2003, the difference between black and white in Grade 4 (cm1), when the first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
While the results of children in the two groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the district expressed the concern that the increase in the growing rate by the Chief of Educational Institutes Michelle A. Rhee and the Maire, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrate) were promoted by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we have highlighted the agrégate, considering the elements above the scale, which is problematic and genetic, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in the Department's education.
I don't know joy for one or two winning points, said Kwame R. Brown (democratic origin), Member of the Council of D.C., whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (elementary School).
Remember the Rhee Management style, Brown said that the message of test results was that the middle schools (colleges) of the city need an unsuccessful attention.
Indeed, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what makes fear is that we don't consacreate enough time and energy at our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said that the district should continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of students in difficulty.
For example, some teachers were formed to use a new read method, the Wilson Reading System, for schools of the end of the initial cycle and start of college that have not incorporated the bases of read early in their school course and are sufficiently late in comparison with their partners.
Each day, the mathematic program, for children's classs (maternal) in Grade 6 (6th) highlights the games and experiences of real life, such as they have been established in the District by the former responsible Clifford Janey, which must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I just think that we should continue to work to offer better interventions to these students at the level less than that of the class, said Rhee.
Others believe that the results of the NAEP pose the question of whether Rhee can continue to remove the system's general results while providing money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce distance.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher of education at the University of Berkeley in California, who studied the results of the cities tests.
Conventional political solution is to build your resources and school management reforms located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
So this target may have political impacts that result in this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that as other school overseers, she tries to serve as the average white and black class.
We will focus on the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our neighbouring schools so that all families, wherever they are originating, are sure that their children can get a excellent public education.
Janey, now the National Schools Supervisor, stated in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce success differences was the duration of the traditional public school, today in the Washington District of 180 days, to be in competition with the school Charters.
We need to get about 200 days to have the force to change, said Janey, which came to an agreement with the trade of his teachers last year to obtain 185 days, that it considers a "point of start" for further increase in the next contract.
A future promise of higher education
The bus was stopped in Gettusburg College with a long seal.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, down and shut up a moment at the white columns, crap façades and green bones.
The parents of Graciela could only end the school in El Salvador.
Once recently, Graciela himself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never put feet on a university campus.
Thus, while she and other students of Grade 8 (4th of the group explored Gettysburg where school costs are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than that of a new enthusiastic new student.
Super where I'm going to study! Graciela was exclaimed that he wanted to study the doctor, while the guide was leading them to the entry of the science building.
Youpi, really? Did she sound, when it was indicated to him the low relationship professor of law - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh visiting children during their three-day discovery trip, and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not to know if you go to the university:
The question is where.
Although this question is still widely addressed for the large number of American children born from Spanish immigrants who have left the school where parents have become adolescent, they are also hundreds of thousands of children to benefit from the university education that will allow them to enter in the mean class.
In fact, "a Spanish of the "second generation" on the fiveth generation of his studies at the school -- a notable success if both their immigrant parents, most of the Mexican or Central America, were entered in the United States without having completed the school.
Their success is important, they say researchers, they open the way to the next generations that will play a significant role in the country's work.
The researchers that study battles claim that they have natural affinity with school and need to be successful.
Many are also those whom parents fix high targets to their children and who find ways to compensate their lack of familiarity with American schools.
The mentionate programmes also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children as it will reach to the university, in particular if their efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low income families with parents who have no experience and expertise to help them navigate in the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher in Davids, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a network of support to these children, from maternal to the school.
The federal program that financed the visit of Graciela universities is a good example.
Knowing on the name of GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize university preparation programmes that start when low income family students are in school (college) and continue to end the school years.
Since 1999, the programme has been monitored by over 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent in the university, according to the American Education Ministry.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has succeeded to acquire important oil companies in order to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two inquiries that have ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Ministry of Iraqi oil with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are to play a major role in the transfer of Iraq's oil industry, invalided for decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are shared with a participation in only two of the 10 shopping fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second bond that began Thursday.
The only one who had put a helmet lost.
Two American companies obtained contracts for shopping camps in June.
The low representation of American oil generates in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Lastly, Irak opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies opening the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraqi Oil Forum, a website of information on the Internet.
There will be a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The security concerns, corrupted by massive, mardi coordinated bombs and political instability, while the American military troops removed the American oil corporations, preventing them to enter with more force in Iraq, with the third largest world's brutal oil reserve, are analysts.
In some cases, American companies were disvantaged because of their rivals, in particular Chineses and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose handwork costs were significantly lower and were more ready to take risks because they did not take account of shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Ministry.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have maintained strong links with Iraqi Petrole Minister and gave him their technical advice, are distributed the empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts assigned this weekend.
China National Petroleum Corp., detained by the State, has more inquired about contracts than other companies and is shared with significant participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is being a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, the portal of the Petrole Minister.
We are confident that the Chinese society will be equally with its competitors and carry out its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies to submit entrepreneurs made offers that were then compared to the barl tariff that the Ministry agreed to pay for the purpose of producing above the current levels for each field.
One of the main organizations of Al-Qaida had been killed in Pakistan
It seems that a American missile, shocked along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of Al-Qaida's organizations this week, declared the sale of American anti-spionship authorities.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders of this autom.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a couple of missiles launched in their car, mardi near the city of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities argued that the missiles were shooted by a non-pilot aircraft that was used by the CIA within the Anarchic Tribal Border of Pakistan.
They conducted a white car, heading to the Afghan border when the car was shocked, said a member of Pakistani civilian services, expressing Miran Shah's phone.
Representatives of the Authority said that the local suspected warriors were on the place and quickly confidenced what remained "totally discharged."
The local authorities were totally impossible to check the identity of victims, but the two American antiterrorist representatives gave unspecific evidence that Somalia was part of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of Al-Qaida Military Organizationers who directed the terrorist operations of the group outside the Afghan-Paki region.
His role was to organize compliments throughout the world, stated one of the authorities who wanted to keep the anonym, quoting the sensitive nature of aircraft inside the Pakistani territory.
In view of its central role, this was probably understood conspirations against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic consignments of Al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the United States authority stated that Somalia had made rapid progress in Al-Qaida's borders and had a very good relationship with other extreme groups in the region.
It may not be known about the large American public, but it does not reduce the threat that it is for us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second important person of Al-Qaida or the second leader of Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of wars in the tribal ceinture, and three other operators.
The rythm of the attacks carried out by the CIA's drones has decreased since the summer, about six operations per month to two, according to the numbers made by the Long War Journal, a website modified by a group with non-profit.
This decline may have been made by improved tactics of terrorist groups who have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while killing the suspected computers also unlikely claiming the site.
The United Nations Special Envoy to Kaboul was discarded
The United Nations Special Envoy in Afghan, Kai Eide, declared on Thursday that he would depart from his post in March, at the end of a smooth mandate involving extensive corruption allegations during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations.
Eide's department is at the time when the Obama Administration decided to send 30 000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations envoy said he supported this increase but expressed his concerns on the calendar of the United States for the retreat of troops that would begin in 18 months and which would force the other NATO Governments to remove their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust in the international community, said Eide in a telephone maintenance of Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diploma also pressed the United States and the other military forces to increase the number of international officials assisting political transition in Afghanistan.
Military increase must be copied by civilians, said it.
Eide said he would not leave but only respect his commitment to his family in March to pass only two years in Kaboul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it should be better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there were two months between the start of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already been looking for a replacement.
Representatives argued that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; it is an Italian-Switzerland citizen who recently chaired a United Nations mission in Bagdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French citizen who previously directed United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The Reputation of Eide in Afghan was tested after his former adviser Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused, in September, to promote President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to dismiss the evidence of massive election fraud.
He refused these allegations, but he said that the accusations of Galbraith -- who had been thanked -- "he had harmed the mission because there had already been a good dose of scepticism on the international observance of elections."
He said that he had proposed the appointment of a civil representative to coordinate the support of the United States forces in Afghanistan.
He also stressed the United Nations Representatives to authorize his successor to employ more staff from the United States and other Western countries that it was not assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would allow them to give greater confidence to their money.
He expressed its frustration on the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the huge United Nations employee regulations were able to provide new talents.
The United Nations rules are like that I couldn't recruit only one person since May, said it.
It's catastrophic, and it can't stop.
Gates: Iran must undertake additional sanctions
The Defense Secretary, Robert M. Gates said the Tuesday that the major world powers will soon impose "decisive additional sanctions" on Iran because it was not able to engage in nuclear ambitions talking.
Gates, expressed before a part of 300 American soldiers in the north of Iraq, during a week ' s visit in the war zones in Afganist and Iraq, degraded the possibility of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, said, in response to the question of a soldier about the possibility of such a renewal.
One of the things I'm worse is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it's the unprevisible side of war.
The Obama Administration considers a set of sanctions that would be the military and political election of Iran, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said that a "assembly of motivations and punishments" could be necessary to convince the Iranian government that it would actually be less good with nuclear weapons ", because "her people would suffer so much" of these sanctions.
On Thursday, in a declaration of the White House's parliament, Robert Gibbs, the Administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probably" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme totally in accordance with the United Nations Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful goal.
In Geneva's conversation on 1 October, he stated that it would reiterate the dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and accept a significant part of his enriched uranium stocking, in an unsuccessful exchange of fuel reactor for a medical research reactor.
The Administration has undertaken such agreements in order to develop a trust in both sides and to win time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have been removed from an agreement - partly, they say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided on the fact that it is involved or not with the United States.
Franchly, I believe that the raisement of Iran faced some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually given their agreement at the beginning of October, the international community, including Russia and China, had been reached on what they had not considered, in terms of significant sanctions against Iran.
President Obama set on 31 December as a date limit to Iran to respond to proposals before it turns to other options, including the continuation of what the State Secretary of Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "augmented sanctions".
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, the United Nations mission declared what it called "unforeseen allegations" from some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran and said that it was agreed to continue talking with the United States and five major world powers, "to obtain a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington afternoon, met the Irak Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the aircraft for the rich Kurdish oil region to meet the troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tension remains between the Kurdes and the Arab majority in Iraq, especially on borders, property rights and income share.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict to avoid all the delays of the United States plans to reduce the number of armed forces from 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the fear of the Kurdes 'retreatment in suspension. The American authorities quoted Gates to Massoud Barzani, regional government Chairman of the Kurdistan: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within an unified Iraqi."
We won't leave you."
In old Chinese, a direction change
Wang Weijia and her husband have grown around the propaganda showing them, "The Mother Earth is too sweet to welcome more children" and "A baby more, it's a smooth."
They learned so much that the government authorities of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and the elderly population, have radically changed guidance this year and began to encourage young couples to have more children; their reaction was immediately and strong: never.
We have already given our whole time and all our energy to a single child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31 years old, Chief of Human Resources and a 8-month son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child policy in China, creating two generations of single children notably with good games and grooms, exceeded the "persistent petitions", a crisis of the population threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate was decreased by 1.8 children per couple by six when the policy was implemented.
The dissemination of the population, while expected that the number of residents of 60 years and more will be explosed, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, which is over the global average of approximately 20 per cent.
This desequilibrium is still worse in coastal cities with a very trained population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-old people represented nearly 22 percent of the population in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Municipal Municipal Population of Shanghai and the Family Planning Committee) said that feed couples should have babys to "to help reduce the proportion of older population and to prevent the lack of the future".
Shanghai is on the point of become "the old, but not so rich, but - that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden" have said.
Progressive retention
The Chinese single child's policy in the Constitution of the country in 1978 is, without contest, the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist Government.
Parents who transgress this policy may have to pay collective amendments, up to three times their annual income, and to undermine discrimination on the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the police to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while the lawyers of human rights denied abuse in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women from a second child to advocate.
Furthermore, many couples have requiring selective advertisements leading to a ratio of boys - girls normally higher.
In recent years, the population officials have gradually adopted their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rules -- including for city residents, ethnic minorities and cases in which men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they adopted many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, Professor at the Institute of Population Research, at the University of Pekin, said that central government authorities recently discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a unique child.
In July Shanghai became the first Chinese city to start a aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In some time, the posters encouraged the families to have only one child have been replaced by copy of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to make the request of authorisation.
The city government deployed members of the family planning and volunteers to meet couples at their home, and put prospects under their door.
He has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to family planning, the response was deceived.
Annual reply
While responsibilities in a rural city of Shanghai say that they saw an increase in the requests of couple files wishing a second child after the campaign started, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huanan, with a population of 115,000 people, for example, has only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai's responsibilities, argued that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010, it is still expected to be just about 165.000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juing, responsible for the Family Planning Committee in the Shanghai Common Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason for which many people do not want to have more children.
They want to spend their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27-year-old wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26-year-old, declared that they would worship two children and that they were legally authorized.
But as many Chineses, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerns believe that the policy of the unique child is a problem of rights, said Yang, a constructive engineer whose woman is pregnant for seven months of the first child of the couple.
That's true, we want the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only the law.
It's the money.
Other couples quote psychological reasons for explaining their hesitation.
Wang, Responsable of Human Resources, said she wanted only a single child because she was himself. "We were the center of the family and we had the habit that everyone cares for us."
We don't have the habit of take care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Siian, 42 years and owner of a translation company, said more creatively.
For couples working at two, a medium-class, which make down the birth rate, it is said, it must be selfish for success.
The 20-30-year-old people have grown by seeing their parents fighting in the first time of China capitalist, and they don't want to have their own life style, says.
Even a single child asks for a lot of time of his parents, he says.
A mother must leave at least two years of his social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child has only 9 months, you must write his CV to get a place in the best mother."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher level of life, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has projects to reduce emissions
The United Nations climate conference, sponsorized until now by disorganized affections and mutual crimes, was returned under the fires of the Tuesday Chamber, as a result of the publication of a document that emphasizes the ambitious reductions of gas to shut over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that spend most of the load in the next time.
The text that could provide the basiss of a final political agreement to regulate the greenhouse gas, stressed the remaining obstacles, as it cleared the way to take.
But he was seen as an important advance in the negotiations that lack time, with more than 100 world leaders reaching the next week in Copenhagen.
Edited by a United Nations Special Working Group, the text does not say how rich countries would give the poor to support climate, long-term, and long-term heating.
It offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how the developed economies and new emergency economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the higher limit of global temperatures that responsible members would be ready to to tolerate.
He gives a great flexibility to the process, said John Coequy, representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who published six pages of the document, studied a 180 page negotiation text to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General described on the climate change of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as “the complete image”.
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent to 1990, while the main developing countries during the same period would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent.
In addition, countries would reduce emissions from 50 to 95 per cent of 2050.
The European Union also renewed the negotiations, on sale, by promised to provide $3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change – to support injuries and seed or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Thursday, the same verbal alterations have been produced, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the representative of the United States on climate negotiations, rejected any discussion that obliges the reduction of gas to be decreased by industrialized countries, compared to voluntary efforts carried out by the main emergency economies, if they were not financed by developing countries.
This change is the signal that Obama administration becomes more harder towards China than Bush's administration, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of the main developing countries, said Star, who regrets that the text is not sufficient to ensure that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments a hour after the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said that the American main negotiator was lacking "good", or "extremely irresponsible" to say in the week that the United States would not financially help China to combat climate heat.
With the future economic trajectors of the main world powers in play, deficiencies appeared both within the third world and between the industrial world and the emergency economies.
Currently, the battle is more related to the salvation of individual economies than the savings of the planet, with China and the United States, who want to take up their respective obligations, while the poorest nations stress the fact that the two twenty-first countries have the most influence to ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate in Costa Rica, said that it was not surprised that the main powers were struggling to know what should be decreasing the costs of the reduction in the greenhouse gas, even though the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emissions responsible for their actions.
It's really a game in which a new economic hero is developed, said Ulate, who is also adviser on the climate for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to put the pressure to obtain a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that negotiations will lead at least to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Insulary Pets States meeting 43 members has issued a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the Climate Unit of the European Commission, said that the action of small island States had "mixed a political pressure on the complete political process" in part by which they are now unified and requested to emergency economies such as China and India to act.
Debates became an urgent case, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve the majority of the problems in the case before government leaders reached an agreement.
High-level responsibilities such as the Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Ministror descended from their airplane and were entered in the Bella Center building to attend home-class meetings and information conferences, so that they may be able to make complaints that will be studied during the next week.
The real image of the assembly -- during which 13,000 people enter and release from the Congress palace every day -- the guitar players attract night spectacles from countries who, according to them, are traced and that proposals are drafted and distributed on paper instead of emails -- is a real challenge.
Intensity is only increased: almost all the important ministers are here and after Monday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the court, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for the World Conservation Policy.
Heavy weights arrive.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will refine the Monday Sindrome
At 5 p.m. on Monday, a sifflet shock will pass the night to signal the start of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Great Britain.
The first large-speed shipping train of the country will reach 225 km/h, while it will take Ashford from Kent in London, St. Pancras, which covers 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes on the board of the first Javelin banking train outside London.
He hoped that the new service will allow Great Britain to integrate an international fast and reliable train network and link the major Midlands, North and Scotia concursions in London.
The lost small troops will become flowering bathrooms, business trips will be less long and the passenger of the aircraft and the train car will reduce the national carbon emissions while decreasing shipments on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties are adherent to this project.
But the ten billion books required to build a new fertile network, inevitable planning battle and the fears of environmental dangers are risking to shut the British lines to a large speed.
According to The Times, High Speed 2 (HS2), a company created in January to achieve a performance report for the Government will make a document to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow you to get a detailed map of the next step planned for the high speed network.
The new line connecting London to West Midlands will be drawn in the five meters of the urban area and sites where the environmental impact can be discussed.
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters of the final entry.
HS2 is also expected to present three options for a larger speed network, heading to the north.
Lord Adonis will answer the spring.
Privileged options are put forward in a Y configuration for which a high speed line will go to West Midlands.
The line will be separated in two or near Birmingham, with a branch towards the west of the Peninsians in Manchester and the Scotia and another way to the northeastern, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line will cross the ECB.
"It seems to be the best performance option", said a rail professional.
When this will be finished, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced at 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a trip of an current hour.
The proposals will be allowed to travel to 400 km/h, making the British network the fastest world's worldwide.
The initial track is designed to allow 400 meters of length and to transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 hours trains can work on a London line - Birmingham.
A terminal that can welcome 20000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
As given space barriers, an existing shop will be wide to receive the high speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce if he thinks or not that the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures means that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launchs the machine, the network should be built partly.
The trains will first be obliged to run out of high speed lines on the northern rails of Birmingham, maintaining travel periods between London and Scotia over three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a trail passenger, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Contributors repay the appropriation of 75.000 GBP for the Tory Clearing
Alan Duncan, the main member of the parliament of Tory, has paid thousands of books per year to repay the cost of a parentary that he has built in his house.
The responsibilities of the party that David Cameron was retreated for being complainted that the members of the Parliament were "received", increased its fund of 75,000 GBP to build an enlargement in his second house, in Rutland.
It was authorized to pay additional interests, as amounts of hundreds of books per month, to the subsidiary.
The Common authorities received complaints at that time and were not interrogated by Sir Thomas Legg, who performed a control of the expenditure of members. Last night, Mr. Duncan said that the complaints could not be "be clearer or simpler."
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of the Parliament, is owner of a house at two floors in a village of Rutland - Melton.
Avoining houses were sold for nearly a million books.
The shooting restaurant includes a kitchen, a salon and a room to eat, but the Emotions Office states that Mr Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a verranda to the house, describing it in his plans as a parentary.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for joy".
Mr. Duncan was not requested to explain for the increase in the payment during a recent investigation made by the Common Privileges Committee and Standards on its pre-employed reimbursement provisions.
The Committee innocent the last month of any non-compliance accused of the rules, after an investigation on its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the payment of 271.406 GBP from London to the house of its circumscription purchased in 1991, the year before it becomes a member of the Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about 1,400 GBP per month of payment interests until March of last year.
In April, his requests increased more than 800 GBP per month.
The interest rate of Mr Duncan RBS has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were aimed at financeing the employee of 75.000 GBP.
The standard RBS rate was 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March, this year, without movement since then.
The last publication of the Common Authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask 1 250 GBP in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position of the Fantastic Office in September, after a journalist under the cover of the film that declared that the members of the parliament had to survive on the budget after the expenditure scanning.
"In fact, it's now national, you must live on budget, and you're treated as "of the...e"
He said, "I spent my money on my garden, and I asked a small part, based on what was right.
and I could ask more holyness, but I didn't do it."
The member of the Parliament, a million since his former post as negotiating in oil, began to explain his expenditure in May, after it appeared that he had asked thousands of books for his garden before being agreed with the cost office that "to be considered excessive".
A activist slaughtered a £ in the sweet of Mr Duncan, to protest after he was revealed that he had requested 4.000 GBP for three years.
Questioned on the increase in the employee, last night, Mr. Duncan said, "This was for capital improvements that were both approved by the Legg Office and then by Legg."
He added: " There is no matter of derogation or development or use of rules or anything else.
It was very clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be net or simpler."
Fidels, all come here to see the calendar of the Brighton Event
Brighton's beach chains found a new way of promotion for winter months, an interactive event calendar.
Beyond, a group of the alternative church that encourages the spiritual explosion by creativeness, invited 24 owners to decorate their chain for each December, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st, while visitors were allowed to visit the last chain from 17.30 to 18.30 a.m. each day, with freely servied pathetes and warm wine.
The Christmas songs up to now include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas," for which the chain presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, is a hove’s TV marketing assistant, a non-employed priest from Chichester's diocese and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"Why, as a church, why are we waiting for people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should draw close to people and celebrate more captively.
"The idea of the calendar of the Avenue of the beach chain came just after a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is a so creative and living place and we try to experimentate and represent this through spirituality."
Forte mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate
Decades of thousands of people have shown Sabbath to complain an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate heating through the world and in Copenhagen, where the police had conducted several hundreds of interpellations.
At least thirty thousands of people, according to the police, have deployed a hundred thousand in the cold in the Danish capital, at the margin of the United Nations Conference on Climate, which was intended to purchase this sale to an agreement enabled to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, illustrated by these manifestations, has contributed to make the "political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital were just after the department of the court, when a group of 300 manifestants, totally black clothes, slaughtered vitrines with shoes and martels, found an AFP journalist.
Anti-emid police officers are soon undertaken without a household.
In total, the police announced the interplication of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to the members of the Black Blocs, these ultraviolen groups, which were particularly illustrated at the top of NATO in Strasbourg, on the east of France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizations of the manifestation, declared the conditions in which hundreds of warriors were interplied, emphasized that a hundred of them " were always reserved in the Sabbath Street "menoted and maintained in position, despite extremely cold".
A part of the Parliament, the courtyard, instead of a good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, the negotiations site.
The manifestants stopped about 500 meters of the building, without trying to spend it.
A scene had been made to welcome the planned speakers, before a counterparty with the participation of the former South African Architec, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the manifestants came in because and in the large cities of Europe, but many Asians, some of the Chinese and Koreans, were also presented as well as Africans.
About 3,000 people, for most impermeable sky blue, had formed a first assembly in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the friends of the Earth, who heard to form "Blue Mares" for "justice for climate".
Today we go down in the streets to ask for reparation of the ecological debt in favour of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a colonial warrior of the South Coalition Jubilee Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue to say: We have had a time, he estimated the béninoise Angelica Kidjo.
There are rivers that sit in Africa, water courses where we can walk as we have never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the alternative movement approached environmental organizations.
The French deputy José Bové, a figure of altermonalism, explained being come to Copenhagen for "all climate and social justice": "Actually, there is no punishment between the fight against climate heat and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific region, which opened many particularly vulnerable islands to the heating, had given the cutting of manifestations.
Some 500,000 people, according to the organizations, were descended in the streets in Australia.
In Manille, a few hundreds of students, most students, have swimmed in red, treeing bands from sun energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, assemblies of hundreds of manifestants were also held to claim energy action against climate change.
In France, the manifestations organized by the “350” network gathered hundreds of people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (south), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
A few decades of people gathered in Geneva.
Apartheid Abkhazie elected his President, Georgia declares a "face"
Abkhazie elected his President, a few more than one year after the recognition of Moscow in this separate region of Georgia, while Tbilissi condemns a "face".
Some 131.000 were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for the control of the South Ocean, another Georgian secsionist territory recognized by Russia.
The vote offices closed at 17.00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58 per cent of a few hours before the closure, according to the electoral committee of Abkhaze.
The first provisional results were to be announced in Sunday night.
The five candidates in license, among whom the President exhibited, Serguei Bagapch, categorically rejected the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are a thick.
On his side, the President of Georgia, Mikheïl Saakachvili, "really regrets that Abkhazie is slaughtered under the total occupation of Russia," said its speaking door, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216.000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After being separated from Georgia during the conflict of 1992-1993, which has made several thousands of dead, Abkhazie is trying to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared to the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historic historian, who claimed to have voted to Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the electors who went to the vote office in a school of Sukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with some palmyers before the entry.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the President in this region to subtle landscapes at the Black Sea.
Big Panx shown by Mr. Bagapch on the side of the President and the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitri Medveev and Vladimir Poutine, have been installed in this small territory of 216.000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, reserved a warm accommodation to Russian officials who came to supervise the movement of the election.
We, the Abkhaze people, are grateful, did he say during a small ceremony, in allusion to support Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazie.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a vodka drink.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by the election by the former vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two business men, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, as the Russian vice-president gave control on the frost routes of Abhaaz for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims not to support the current power, nor opposition.
A majority of 50% more a voice is required to return the election.
If any candidate does not meet this floor, a second tour must be organized in the two weeks.
Climate: world manifestations, incidents in Copenhagen
Decades of thousands of people marketed in the world in order to claim an ambitious and binding agreement to the Copenhagen Conference, where the police, on the quive, interviewed about 700 people in the margin of an imminent manifestation.
Twenty thousand people, according to the police, have deployed a hundred thousands in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes the delegates of 193 countries to search for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Party of the Parliament, the courtyard, overall good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where negotiations are launched.
The manifestants stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to spend it.
A scene had been made to welcome the planned speakers, before a counterparty with the participation of the former South African Architec, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the cutting, a group of hundreds of manifestants, totally black clothes, snakes and martyrs, slaughtered vitrines, observed an AFP journalist.
Anti-employed police were closed soon and interviewed without household, putting several of them to the ground.
The police announced the interruption of 600 to 700 people, predicting that it was mainly members of the Black Blocs, these ultraviolen groups that were particularly illustrated at the top of NATO in Strasbourg, on the east of France, in April.
At the end of the midday, a police was shocked by a shock and four cars fired near a squad in incidents that led to the interruption of a twenty-four person, according to the police.
We looked at the extreme groups, warned the police door, Henrik Jacobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces turn into the heavens.
The majority of the manifestants, who came to the large cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, was of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also presented as well as Africans.
About 3,000 people, for most impermeable sky blue, had formed a first assembly in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the friends of the Earth, who heard to form "Blue Mares" for "justice for climate".

The French deputy José Bové, a figure of altermonalism, declared to the AFP to come to Copenhagen for "ear climate and social justice": "now now there is no punishment between the fight against climate heat and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization mobilized several personalities, including the Danish Mannequin Helena Christiansen, the former United Nations Commissioner to Refugees Mary Robinson, who had to address the people.
The Asian-Pacific region, which opened many particularly vulnerable islands to the heating, had given the cutting of manifestations.
Some 500,000 people, according to the organizations, were descended in the streets in Australia.
In Manille, hundreds of students, most of them, showed red clothes and treeed bands from sun energy before the chief of the Colombian capital.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, several hundreds of manifestant assemblies were also held to claim an action against climate change.

The history is strengthened by the reform of the general school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview to show in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "reforcing" from the reform of the general school, despite the elimination of their obligatory education in scientific terminal.
Today, first students will have every four-day hour and the same program for a shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "I need to get out of hypocrisis" because, according to him, "the S filier is no longer a scientific subsidiary" but "in large, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L branches cannot remain subfilms of the S, continued to stress: "I haven't heard many historicals and intellectuals to identify the absence of terminal geographical history in technological schools."
On Saturday, a Siop study in Humanity showed that nearly seven French people on ten (69%) denied the government project to remove the binding education of the geographical history in terminal S. Many intellectual and teachers also criticized this elimination, as well as the left and some right elections.
Instead, the Minister added that it was not "no question" to remove the philosophy of the terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of the teachers' training, while 16 organizations (studys and trades) called on a march mobilization day to protest against the project, which offers the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In master 2 (M2), they will pass at the beginning of the year a test of admissibility that will bring on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will lead to their teaching ability, explained the Minister.
They will also follow stages in the M2 year then will be the first year before students as stage teachers.
If you add all the stages proposed before the competition, you will already receive more presence before students, or more than 300 hours, it has continued.
Finally, the Minister states that it will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also reaffirms the project to remove the school card since 2012.
In Normale Su, experts have 15 minutes to convince the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the Summit of Copenhagen: it was the challenge that the Chairman Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Expert Group on Climate Evolution (GIEC) was invited by Ulm's Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also the Nobel price of peace, inaugured the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day constituted an enquiry of experts, 15 minutes each, filmed and opened to the public, observed an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that touchs people and gives them a wish to know more, explained at the level of the Edouard Hannezo Conference, 22-year-old, one of the organizations of that day, who took his name from the one given by the students to the fishing of the school basin.
It is chosen a twenty-five of intervenants among the experts of their discipline and is selected for their charismatic side, is it specified.
On climate heating, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk to key goals in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but through graphics, before 50 people.
This is part of our scientist's role, he stressed, hoped that auditors will reiterate that "the Copenhagen Conference is supported in a extremely serious scientific record".
Videos from these conferences will be online on the school site from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is planned in February, followed by other to a bimestrial rythm.
Payment rates: angry of prison supervisors, planned actions
The prison supervisors unions called the "general mobilization" Friday to require the payment of the final year feasts and additional hours of which the payment was paid in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Petitionary (2th Unit of Oversights) requested staff who would not be able to manifest on Monday morning before the prison institutions and to "block them" to "declare the flight of their duties".
The CGT-Pententiary (Third of the Professional Syndicate) calls them to "join General Meeting in the various prisons for strong mobilization", which judges "high and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "additional hours, night prizes, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first unity of supervisors, the Federal Federal Autonomy Union (Ufap/Unsa), "he calls for general mobilization (...) to bring back the incontinent and wrath".
The Directorate-General and the Ministry of Justice explains that additional hours have increased much in 2009 and have not all been budgeted but ensured that the recruitment will be paid in January.
The Chairman has explained at the end of the day that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent a mail to the supervisory trade unions to ensure that this payment would be performed in the next month.
I don't know the efforts provided by staff for the operation and modernisation of our criminal system, wrote the Minister of Justice in this mail.
I requested the Directorate of the Penal Administration to set up a comprehensive set of measures to ensure that this situation born a bad evaluation of the number of additional hours is not reproduced in the future, added Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The payment of December, therefore, will be large, except for senior leaders who benefit from faming functions and objectives, has deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for which "budgetary counterparts have a good deal".
It is a pure scandale, the interregional FO union of Marseille, announcing its decision of boycotter until the new order "all meetings and convocations".
Personals will not come to work on their Sunday and holiday days if those of the October month are not regulated in December, they are for additional hours, and also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time when our tasks and missions are increased without increased our effectiveness, it is more regrettable to take it to the personnel's departure, estimates the Bordeaux CG.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are less lovers than others.
But in any way the account is not there, found the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-Francois Forget.

He had been blessed two passengers, apparently on the shock: a thirteenth and a quarter, the last grief.

U.S.: the lawyer Polanski reiterates the ban
The lawyer of the French and Political cinema Roman Polanski recalled a new juvenile in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), abandoning his client's return, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a death case over 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the "Pianist", announced three judges of the second district of California of serious procedures at the time of the fact, in 1977.
I claim to abandon the charges here and now, Mr. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge in charge at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "fryed in the dust."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- deceived since -- had discussed, before he was sentenced, with a lawyer who had said that Roman Polanski had granted the prison -- which is a serious prosecution.
This debate was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, searched and desired), from the mouth of the advocator, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared that until September he had "menses" to the documentary author.
In the case of the court refused to abandon the continuation, Mr. Hummel requested the holding of a proceeding, which would enable him to submit the evidence of his argumentary.
The accused has reiterate the argument already developed in the first place, namely that no leave of charges could be severely studied as long as Roman Polanski would not be present before the court.
The cinema, aged 76, was fled from the United States in 1978, before his sentence, for "illictive sexual relations" with a less than 13 years of age.
He has never sent his feet to the United States since.
The advisor of the Los Angeles committee, Phyllis Asayama, said that Roman Polanski "dot be here to be present to hearing."
In this case, would you like to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused ones, is it possible to run away?, Mrs Asayama.
For her, the cinema "defeats a favor to the court, while lacking his authority".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make their decision, also stressed "what there were other alternatives to flee".
Mr. Hummel wasn't the only one to ask for an abandonment against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also recalled her, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Remembering that his customer does not support being shocked to any reinforcement of the Polanski case, she added: "Another one in this room can say that the procedure was just.
30-2 years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on the american arrest mandate.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to reside in his chalet of Gstaad, waiting for an eventual extradition.

Honestly, the market is very calm, Mace viewsilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in close margins, the volume of exchange has become very low and I think that this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "contributed to improve the market's view on the solidarity of economic recovery," resumed Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, detail sales increased by 1.3 per cent in November for the second month of assignment and more than planned.
The confidence of American consumers has also been clearly reduced in December, at 73.4 to 67.4 on the previous month, according to the preliminary estimation of the Michigan University Index.
The indexes, however, were frozen by a new progress of the dollar, the most higher than two months before the euro, which "powers the sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick from Germany.
Technological values thus lost the field.
The compulsory market slowed.
The income of the Tresor to 10 years has progressed in 3.540% against 3.482% Monday night and the good at 30 years to 4,497% against 4,492% the helmet.

During this great measuring of the beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the districts of Johannesburg, five of them have already decreased their ticket for half-final.
Ms. Japon Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta del Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo de Sierra Leone, Kayane Aldorino de Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada have been elected sportive Miss or still a top model during their African stay.
That was a real tourbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cap, it was extraordinary.
I saw all things and lived so many experiences!, Mrs. Sierra Leone explains.
This competition, which takes place for the nineth times in South Africa, is transferred from Midrand to the north of Johannesburg from 17.00 p.m. (15H00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to give my coron.
This experience was fascinating.
I am glad to have lived it two times, emphasizes Mrs. Monde Ksenia Sukhinova in the warmth of the Australian summer.
For the young Russian, his second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with candidates and recovered "the landscapes to cut the souffle in this country".
After a month of galaxy, repetitions, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses now focused on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presents this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, all of the two stars of Bollywood.
It's the dream of every woman to be the most beautiful coroned in the world, but it's not just the appearance.
We are the embassy of our country, and I want to go home with the king, launching Mrs. India with a great dream.
According to the organizations, music and dance will point this 59th edition.
The candidates will be deployed in traditional and obviously in bathroom mail.
The spectacle will be named by a television presentator, China Angela Chow, the former South African Beauty Queen Michelle McLean, and a responsibility of Mrs. Monde Steve Douglas.
South Africa showed that she was able to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that it is difficult to equality, to ensure Julia Morley, President of Miss Monde.
The candidates made a safari last year, visited the famous Soweto cityship, but this time at ice, and enjoyed the local kitchen.
They also met the South African President Jacob Zuma who slaughtered their hands.
Not used for a Head of State, noted Mrs Sierra Leone.
Their earliest memories will certainly remain in the Cap (south-west) for the Football World Coupe of June 2010, a way to promote a little more event.
I've been friendly of people that I never thought I could approach.
I'm not sure to return to the World-2010 Worldwide, encouraging Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
The news of Johnny Hallyday is very positive, according to his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday "sees very positive", assured her son David's Tuesday at his arrival to the Los Angeles airport where he had to get to the chest of his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it happens very well, stated to the David Hallyday press at his outcome from the flight that brought it from Paris a few hours after 13h00 local (21H00 GMT).
The son of the channel, the air detained, assured that he would become "speak" at the Cedars-Sinai hospital of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admised for a consequent infection in the operation of a discreet heritage in Paris on November 26th.
The songer was "played in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent it to suffer and to administer his treatment," stated the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by the doctors of the Hospital Cedars-Sinai de Los Angeles, where he was admissible for a consequent infection in the operation of a discrete hero in Paris on November 26.
The player had to be reopened on Thursday night because of significant lessons resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went on Thursday morning at the French school of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade was schooled to attend a school spectacle, found an AFP photo.
The Head of orthopedic and traumatic surgery of the Hospital of Pitié-Salpêtrier, Yves Catoné, announced that he would come to Monday at Los Angeles at the channel.
The producer was violently encountered by Dr. Stephane Delajoux, the neurochirurgy who performed the player on November 26 at the International Clinical Park Monceau Park in Paris.
We said it was a mask.
Los Angeles surgery said they were out, said Mr. Camus.
I heard about a possible judicial procedure to come, said he.
Jean-Claude Camus estimated that Johnny Hallyday was "a lot too fast part for Los Angeles, with the authorisation of the Paris surgery."
I had this online doctor who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and that was awesome, since I had two discrete heroes, he added.
Before previously on RTL, he had indicated that the player was apparently "free part, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stephane Delajoux is very known in the artic environment.
He worked at the actor Mary Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic of Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was experiencing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated actor Charlotte Gainsburg to resort a hematom following a cerebral hemorragia.
But it is also a doctor for the sulfurous reputation, sentenced several times by justice, in medical responsibilities, as well as for fiscal and scroquency fraud.
My Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Mediterranean order, accused him of being "unclean man" continued "regularly" before the Council of Order, which is "thereasoned to be recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stephane Delajoux expressed himself on Thursday by his lawyer Me David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention was "facely well launched" and that post-operatory reviews were "normal".
The operation "it was not hemorragical and therefore did not need the place of a drain", he added.
In any case, the tour of the songer, whose health nerves are multiplied since this year, seems to be between pairs.
Of course, it seems very short, said Mr. Camus, a reprise of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, ndlr).
The UDF association increases the tunnel and sums the New Centre to do not use its sile anymore
UDF's association, controlled by the Modem de François Bayrou, reacted on Thursday, on the trial of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the seat of the former Gibraltarians, putting it still on no support, under the punishment of judicial proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to restore the UDF sect, judgeing that François Bayrou did not defend his political heritage after having had led his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party was part of the UNPU, was also planned to confirm this strategy in the CN National Council.
To support his outcome, he received the support of Mrs Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP previously) who returned the UDF mark's property to the National Institute of Industrial Provision in 2004.
But on Thursday night, the UDF Association office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not listen to be able to take place, was out of his silence to launch a residence to the Minister and Deputy, which summoned them not to use it and to send them to the mark's property, under the punishment of judiciary continuations.
You have multiplied, these last days, the statements indicated that you are going to offer your political movement of +reprendre+ the UDF, which wrote the association in a email signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnis du MoDem, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centre Alliance.
You have also believed to follow your military material and your website's maintenance page, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan + the UDF today, also found the email signatures.
As you don't know, you have no right to use this chapter, explaining the UDF office that still enables the NC to "immediately remove the name of the UDF name of any support and (son) website".
He also requests Hervé de Charette "to submit the property of the mark to his lawyers with right".
If you do not, the courts would be in place to comply with the law and the legal rights of UDF adherents.
In their email, they explain that the UDF is a political movement since 1978 and recalls that Mr. Morin and his friends had made the choice to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others did in 2002, to create the UMP."
The New Centre therefore has no right to use the UDF set (the Union for the French Democracy).
They also recall that the last UNUDF meeting in 2007 voted to MoDem for three years and the creation of a office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valery Giscard of Esteing.
With regard to Hervé de Charette, he continued to the office, "he has put the mark", he was not "more adherent to the UDF for three years," but to the UNP.
It benefits scandalously and fraudly from the UDF acronym absorption for its account.
This indelicacy is being transformed in a crime, and they are denied, before Ironising on the CN strategy: "It seems to be more honourable in policy, as in life, to make a name by itself than to try to get out of the anonymate by fraudly taking a name to which it is not right".

But the 15th correction room also ordered that a medical expert of Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, should be conducted collegely by three doctors.
The main heritage and shareholder of the Oreal has always refused to submit to such a review, in any case not under the conditions proposed by Nantere Park during the investigation.
Dr. named doctors should report before 10 March 2010, including whether Liliane Bettencourt has been found in a state of weakness and at which periods.
I think she's going to come here.
I'm going to talk to him, told Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the Court's decision.
It is an excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (M. Barnier) managed this old woman that we must protect, did he.
Since two years, Liliane Bettencourt's unique daughter invokes a criminal prosecution against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist to all, that she accused of having benefited for years of the lowness of her mother to obtain a billion euros of gifts, in the form of Cheques, insurance contracts or insurance tables.
On the side, Liliane Bettencourt has always reaffirmed having been handled by the photo that she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to consider the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' plaidories sometimes turned to the large family packaging on Thursday.
As a result, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt reported three letters sent by his customer (1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she meant the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the post dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer, "to explain my daughter that I wrote to Barnier once, two times a day for 15 years.
Francoise, I never could talk to him since his marriage."
For its part, Nanterre's park reiterated that the complainant was not acceptable to act, so much more than one judge of the Tucles rejected the last days to make the right to his request to open a judiciary procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt " has full ability to act in justice, she is not protected and has no tutor.
Nobody else has to act on his place," said the representative of the Public Ministry, Mary-Chrsitine Davetigney.
The Court finally decided that it would be pronounced once the proceedings would have been done on the receipt of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Administrative Revolution or the end of economic intellectuality?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French enterprises, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been just...
Over a decade of years, the attitude of the management of large enterprises in respect of its employees recalls the position of consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to adhere to "valers" who are determined above as it was once, to impos the consumers of the products thought by the technicians of the plant.
By putting the customer in the company's heart, the marketing revolution has sent marketing strategies to the place... although the authorisation attempt to imposing disconnected products from customer preference factors regularly returns!
The demobilization of employees may be on a mortal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the most general part of a phenomenon that touchs the frameworks in particular.
This demobilization is seriously compromising the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, moreover, the economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IA requires "to all stakeholders (...) a proactive changing and a prospective vision"; it requires a commitment to the employees' income totally contrary to the income of authorisation management.
That's why we call for a management revolution that would be to put collaborators in the company's care center on the same basis as the customer.
The whole relative use of internal opinion investigations
Internal opinions – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees, will they encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First, because I could see that, faced with a new situation, any structure ended, after a distance, to make priority... what she has always done!
- Then, because authorism – one of the pathologies of the power - believes proportionally in the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simple vision of human behaviour.
Its great engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reacted by the "neurosciences" states and widely distributed states, by the study institutions and the media.
So, suggesting that the "leviers" (sic) of the framework commitment may be possible, a recent investigation of Ipsos referred to in Le Figaro.fr is comforted by the leaders in a mechanical governance post inadequated to the world today.
Identifying and measured mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper operation of modern enterprises is to adopt a finalistic vision of human behaviour.
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental constat: for employees, the commitment for the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a way to achieve a part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Today, only the studies carried out by the motive analysis adopted this design of the motivations of employees.
These studies have demonstrated that they judge their business based on a default doxe that allows them, through their image of the company, to evaluate what it provides for them to achieve their live projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, prevent, and anticipate their "social performance" performance and provide their human resources management "towards".
They thus create a favorable field for the development concerted with a robust and efficient economic intellectuality.
Oslo's discours: "just war" is the right lounge in Obama
The United States' law welcomed Monday the old speech in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfying that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemy of the United States.
The conservators, who had broken the price assignment to Mr. Obama on 9 October, adopted this time the presidential talk, at the office of Sarah Palin, the former candidate to the Vice-President in 2008.
I loved what he said, Mrs. Palin, Egyptian the right side of the Republican Party, at the U.S. daily newspaper today, adding to herself to the theme of the "while necessary" war in his memories that have come to be published.
The war is obviously heard by my view that the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be stopped all there, it was estimated.
Mr. Obama, whoher two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afganistan, used Thursday to justify the use of force, a way to explain its decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afganistan over nine days ago.
Another adverse of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, estimated that the President had done in Oslo "the very good job".
I found that the speech was very well, welcomed the former President of the Chamber of Representatives, which particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the Presidential proposal.
In some ways, I found this historic talk, Mr. Gingrich said, interviewed at the radiofunction "The Takeaway".
The former election, considered by some as a candidate to the Republican Investment for the Presidential election in 2012, was glad to have seen "a left President" to remind Nobel's members "do not be free and could not give a peace price if the force remedy wasn't existing".
For Michael Gerson, the former George W. Bush converted chronics to Washington Post, Mr. Obama declared "a very American talk".
In addition to presenting themselves in "the world citizens" as "he always does", "he spoke as a American President," reminding the Europeans, "what they live in a safer of security that they have not created and that they do not make a great thing to preserve it", said Mr. Gerson.
Among the rares right to be not convinced, a faucon of Bush, the former ambassador at the United Nations John Bolton, has qualified the discours of "three, appealed, and without inspiration" on the National Review Online site.
On the left of the President, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich warned to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When the war is supported in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the mass of innocents, it has been guarded.
However, the left center press remained awesome in the direction of the President.
The Los Angeles Times continued to think that the Nobel was prematurely assigned to Mr. Obama, qualificated its allocation of "Super production" even for a known speaker for his talent.
The speaker of Oslo " should serve a road sheet to guide international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression", the Californian daily.
Mr. Obama "declared the speech that he had to do", estimated the New York Times, judged him "the dark and constructing times".
Rounds: three marathons for an agreement to save Christmas supply
After three negotiations of marihuana, the trade and TLF trade unions, the only patronal organization to be stayed until the end, arrived on Friday night at an agreement which ends with the word of grief and the weak threat to Christmas supply.
At the signing meeting on Friday night, the State Secretariat at the transport, Dominic Bussereau, was "joyed" of this agreement, after several negotiations taken on Wednesday morning.
After a second discussion night, the negotiators left on Friday morning, with the hope of signing rapidly at the end of the morning the text of the agreement.
And that's the same if three patronal organizations (FNTR, Onestra, OTRE) had closed the door.
However, more than six hours of a meeting started at 11.00 p.m. so everyone agreed and signed the text at 18.00 p.m.
The conflict "It would have been very harmful for business" and "he was afraid that he came to struggle the end of years," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides an increase of 4% salary for the lower salary (of local and regional road transports), and of 2,9% for higher (international transports).
Time rate, for low loans, " goes from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not a big thing, but from far away, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
It's going to be ordered to our warriors that there's no blocks, no blocks of raviation centres.
But there may always be some recalcants that are not satisfied, he added.
Philippe Grillot, Chairman of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement," even if it was "facile to make ups on high wages accounted for international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of EUR 170 month for low payments and of EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
This is the agreement of the good sense and respect of the employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said to him "a acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for the rebalance of the movement costs of 3 per cent, and the general status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will enable the issue of a 13th month and modernisation of the collective Convention.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of 100 million euros of patronal charges" was subject to a Government's amendment to the draft corrective financial law for 2009, voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same term".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply in the first time to enterprises with this organization, and in the second time, to the whole professional, in case of the Minister of Working.
She will be "in the shortest time", assured Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of patronal organizations can only delay the process.
FNTR announced a "dupes market", as the 100 million euros " had already been promised in the sector to compensate a part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of the Transports has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but to do not contrary the dinners of the next wavellon, the Unostra deplored.
For the other, the agreement may "decrease the tomb d? a very large number of SMEs in the next 12 months".
RER A: disorders this weekend, uncontent unions of the RATP proposals
The disorders on RER A, the largest urban transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Thursday on Friday, on the second day of greeting between trade unions and leaders of the RATP left them on their hunger as regards their prize request.
Thursday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchase before Christmas, there will be only trains between 10:00 and 20:00, due to a train on two on the central throne ( between the Defence and the Nation) and a train on four outside the central throne.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended at Nantere Prefecture, which will force travellers to change the train.
The Lafayette Galeries, who are waiting for 200,000 clients every day, have joyed the fact that "RATP is doing efforts to preserve the big shops".
RER A crosses west and is Paris's aglomation.
The short RATP corner of Saint-German-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Sint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
Wednesday, about a two-hour train circulated at the point hours, and almost no branch in cross-hour, as was expected.
Like Thursday, there was no cows on which the French people were organized.
As in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequencies than ordinary, including the absence of college and licenses.
A Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year engineer, explained that it was "a thirty-first hour early to be sure to arrive at the time".
The Saint-Lazare garage didn't know of saturation, stated the SNCF, which had planned a framework for agents and order forces.
The RER A operated from the SNCF or to Cergiy-Le-Haut arrived or left from the Saint-Lazare car to reach the metros.
The new conventions of gravistes will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results of the "maigres" by the trade unions, of a meeting with the direction on Thursday after midday.
The Director of the EEA proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, worktimes, carriage movement, etc.
This is not what the drivers want, which claims a second, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP also put its first proposals between parents, and emphasized the CGT, emphasized that the direction "is not able to resolve a problem while the roads and the SNCF were done".
A new meeting is planned for "a broader review of the terms of exercise of professionals", stated the RATP.
What has also been said to the unions that the company "floored users of the weekend".
At the morning, some 150 drivers had entered a seat committee in Paris.
It was then that the direction, which was rejected until values of any discussion during the green, suggested "in a matter of disappointment" the meeting.
The conflict is threatening to expand the CER B on March after a predicted Unsa and Independents.
Syndicates request a 120 euro prize (unsa) to 150 euros, with 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and are degrading the working conditions on this line at a million daily travellers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of carriage, touch from 2.200 to 2.700 euros, as well as 600 to 650 euros of prize, for discalled hours, Sundays and Days.
Turkey's justice dismisses the pro-courde party, a serious decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court has proclaimed the dilution of the main pro-courde party of the country, a decision which was immediately followed by angry manifestations in the Curde Community, the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision is risking to greatly compromise the government's task, which has come towards the curde community to try to end up to 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dismissed because it became a "hour of harmful activities to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", stated the President of the Hasim Kiliç Court at the end of four days of debate.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dilution, Mr. Kilizzi, added that 37 of the frameworks of the party, including President Ahmet Turk and Mrs Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the deletion of the parliamentary immunity of Mrs Turk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation of the Party's Trust.
The CTP has 21 seats to Parliament (up to 550).
His leaders had warned before the great that Members would leave Parliament instead of sit as an labelless parliamentary.
The decision is followed by a procedure laid down in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Abdulrahman Yaligiyak Court, which condemns the DTP to obtain the "directives" of the Kyristan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Number of observers believe that the DTP is the legal vitrine of PKK rebels.
The party, however, ensures that it does not have "non organic links" with PKK but refuses to qualify the terrorist organization and calls upon the Government to negotiate with him.
The Court ' s greenness is at the time that the Government has been handling the Curde community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to support the CKK Kurdes and to end the conflict.
The DTP leaders claimed that a dilution could cause a recruitment of tensions in the Southern Anatolian, where many manifestations against the conditions of detention of the head of PKK Abdullah Ecalan have been decreased with the police in the past few weeks.
Since the advertisement of justice, a thousand manifestants gathered before the DTP locals in Diyarbakir, the large cities of the south-east in majority of Kurdes.
The order forces took lacrymogen grenades and used water canons, while manifestants launched molotov cocktails or stones, with frozens.
A hundred people have also shown in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Turk argued that the decision of justice would "develop desires".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (courde, ndlr) by prohibiting a party, said to the press.
The Government, formed by a party of Islamic Mouvance, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed in principle to the closure of the parties.
This does not resolve anything, said the Minister of Energy Taner Ylichz.
This decision is a total torment of democratic opening launched by the government, commented by the Ahmet Island political analysis.
Of course, it is expected to be reacted to a reaction of the PKK.
Thursday, the PKK recovered an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the northern Turkey, one of the most murderers of the last months.
The first necks may fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants, it's a strict winter.
But the responsibility of the road destroying and sampling services (FES) is not to embark citizens.
It's just that the agents can test the vehicle technique and learn to control them well.
And according to the meteorologists, it could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to attack the nest and swimming.
The EES follows a very developed plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that since he was shineing on the city of Francfort and the temperatures fall down under zero, large sampling vehicles were covered by 20 main pieces (named "A") .
This includes large circulation streets, main arteries, such as the New path and Hanauer Landstraße.
They also include powder access, common transport itinerary, pieton zones and pitches such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES agents start their service at three hours of morning.
In the case of need, the 1040 kilometres of swimming pool shall be slowed with a road founder that accompanies, within 3 hours of maximum time.
This is the reason why the FES service begins at 3 p.m. "too roads are delayed when the traffic of daily migration begins".
There or it becomes more difficult, that's when the nest starts to fall at 7.30 a.m.
This poses problems, says the responsibilities of the road switch and switch service "for no automobilist is ready to leave loan vehicles".
Then, if it no longer neglects, we take care of the access roads and cut-off roads, such as the Council-Beil-Straße.
The secondary ways and the late streets are finally coming.
Mr Brauburger knows that this is always a few complaints.
At five hours of the morning, the FES Pedestrian team moved on the road to priorize dangerous areas and passages.
In terms of cyclable pistes, FES services are generally not able to care for it.
Mr. Brauburger explains that there is a special service in Francfort to monitor the status of the bridges between 22 and 4 p.m.
As the green is very rapidly formed on these surfaces, salary vehicles will be entered as the temperature falls below 2 degrees.
Police also calls for this special service in need.
The beast of the dinosaures
The Tawa hallae looked like other meat dinosaures: this bip would measure about 2 meters long for 1,50 m, his post-member was powerful, his long-term clan was covered by a slow and recursive dent, his short arms ended by shocks and had a long chain.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing to be exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in the Sunday Science magazine, Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaures involving these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which made the time part of the lands of the supercontinent, the Panjee, and came to the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt said that the discovery of the Tawa will shine a new day the evolution of the first dinosaures.
Indeed, it refers to the parent's links, the distribution and the characteristics of these.
In 2006, Sertling Nesbitt undertakes other Palestinians, on the Gohst Ranch site north of New Mexico
Randall Irish of the Museum of Natural History of Utah and a member of the team of fouls tells them that there was sometimes a twenty-third of oxes in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary kitchen dating from Trias.
Scientists were very rapidly realized that a part of these osses belonged to a new species.
The crews updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theory about the beginning of dinosaurs evolution.
The researchers baptized him from the name of Tawa, according to the word of the Hopi Indians for the God of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is a completely exceptional discovery: the fossils of the Trias from are extremely rare and limit to some fragments of oss incomplete.
All Paleonology experts do not share this enthusiasm.
For instance, Martin Sander from the University of Bonn does not find that this discovery is specially spectacular, but it provides for some theories to confirm the beginning of dinosaur evolution.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaures occurred on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete what makes very difficult the classification of all the first dinosaurs.
The experts are inter alia to when the Saurians have been divided into three major evolution groups: thermopodes (carnivors) which include tironsure and velociraptors later appear and whose birds, sauropods, quarters on the round, and those who are appearing to them and ornithic herbs, which are part of the species such as torratops and stegoseure.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theropodes.
This species presents an interesting report of both primary and developed characteristics, said S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found indexes that let Tawa hallae have small air sacks at the corner level, as well as the birds that are the descendants of the thermopodes.
These small air pockets facilitate the breathing of birds in relation to mammals.
It seems that in the Hallae Tawa, the greens were also partly filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, Tawa is one of the oldest thermopods presenting small air sacs in his oss.
As the apparent line of large sauropodes also had air sacs and a light ossure, they may be thinking that their common older had already the benefits of this innovation.
Three subsequent migration vagues to North America.
As the most known primitive dinosaures lived in South America, researchers concluded that the Saurians had appeared there.
Thus, the three large lines of evolution were divided and divided from South America to the rest of the world is to say the whole land that formed the supercontinent Panjee.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the Paleonologist team has also discovered the remains of two other theropodes that are not particularly appearing to him.
The three species can not fall from a common adventure that had been mixed, advanced researchers.
Alan Turner of the New York Natural History Museum and Coautor of the Journal of Science Studies said there were at least three migration vagues to North America.
There have been a few contradictions.
Martin Sander, Palestinianian in Bonn, said there is an older species, the sileaure, which lived in the current Poland and belongs to a group appearing to dinosaures.
According to him, it could be a wrong vision because there is a large number of dinosaurs fossiles in South America that have been preserved while there are almost no other continents.
On the contrary, how the dinosaures have been able to become the dominant tights of the secondary era while they were coming from a relatively rare line of the retreats branch, and still remained a mystery today.
At the time of Trias, the dinosaures shared their habitat with many other retreats, such as the ancients of the current crocodiles and many other saurians.
By the end of the Trias, dinosaures disappeared around the planet so that the development of many new species, while others, who were appearing to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurasic.
However, such success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander see two hypotheses.
There could be a massive extinction to which dinosaures have survived deeply while other retreats would have disappeared.
Or then, dinosaures were better adapted, and therefore they could remove competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the decline of a favorite meteorite of a group of animals, which was also developed during the Trias, which has been shocked in the shadow since that time.
Vienna's solidarity in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signaries of the whole world.
There are teachers from the University of Toronto, Cambridge University, Vienna or Berkeley University in California.
There are course charges from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Brussels.
Evacuation by the casino police at the University of J.W. Goethe de Francfort makes vagues on the whole planet.
278 teachers and teachers from University J.W. Goethe, but also other higher educational institutions in Germany, Europe and North America and South America express their solidarity with the protestant students in the Westend Campus.
In a German and English statement they condemn the police's intervention requested by the Director Committee of university.
Last week, the president of the Werner Muller-Estler University had made evacuation of the buildings occupied by students and teachers in greve after the graffiti walls and works.
Five students were blessed during the evacuation.
Signaturers believe that degradations did not justify “a very violent intervention from the police command against students and teachers who had organized their own course”.
Evacuation is an "inacceptable achievement" to the freedom of research and education.
The fact of focusing solely attention on the acts of vandalism is only to "delegitimate and criminalize protest" and try to forget the reasons of mobilization.
The Executive Committee of the university has thus been subject to discussions that would, however, be essential.
Scientific loads require immediate suspension of the committee of criminal proceedings.
Most employees did not participate in degradation.
Legitimation of protests
The youth of the Verdi Union of the Services Sector and the German Union Confederation (DGB) are a solidary students.
Protections are only the legitimate expression of a growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional secretariat of the youth of the Sindicat Verdi.
As regards the Minister of Sciences of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), it took and caused the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of places is totally unacceptable, is it said to the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden last Sunday at the current time of television.
We understand the sense of protests, but we do not accept the vandalism, expressed the Deputy CDU of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (the left) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few pending walls to criminalize protests, Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke) said
Instead of reflecting the arguments and returns of students, they are evacuated.
The left party has made a movement to the Minister of Internal Affairs to report on the conditions of the police intervention.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time she was the reputation of secret city, prohibited Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a secret weapons research place under strict monitoring.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants at 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the Common Reputation is to be the Soviet Silicon Valley.
There are important places of production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, the representatives of Zelenograd created links with Riedberg, the place of French sciences – with the university institutions and the innovation centre of Francfort (FIZ).
There were recital and latest meetings from the representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a “the close cooperation protocol”.
The signaries were the Moscow Vice-Women of Juri Rossljak and the Anatoly Smimou of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz Project Section Chief for Francfort.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and PME, with the strong scientific research point, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also of economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
In turn, Russian scientific companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutions and institutions.
There is the Institute of Moscow Electronics, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaja-Electronika.
The community was established in 1958 as "socialist villa" for arms research.
Zelenograd (Literale "Greens" translation) takes his name of the collines covered in the heart of which the research centres are implanted.
The S21 project: a car for Stuttgart
Stuttgart 21 project is not sufficiently high.
It's nothing less than “new heart of Europe” for its parties.
If we want it. S21, it's much more than the smoothing of a rail chair, more than a colonial construction project that will extend the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtermberg, in a deceased chaos of channels for a decade of years.
Stuttgart 21 is born from the spirit of the 80s.
The line head cars, with ways that ended in full city, had the reputation at the time to be the liquors of the transport technique of the 19th century, which had been effected by modern rail furniture sabote because it had to have been much time to pass back to front.
Stop, stop, go – that's what we need to do.
That's why Line Cars must disappear: in Francfort and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train passenger, which is at mid-way around the TransEuropean Rail Magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, where the slogan "Europe's heart".
The achievement of the S21 project will really start, although the visions of the 80s are not longer compatible with the reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to shoot the car in the respective capitals of Hesse and Baviera, was exorbiting.
Actually, the line chairs do not really possibly pose problems of entry and output since there are modern, reversible trains with authors and pilot cars to two extremities.
However, the achievement of Stuttgart 21 is now started next to the new trace of the interface line to Ulm.
Regional and common policies have introduced it.
The iron road company is from the part, because it is the taxpayer who makes the risk costs of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public undertakings.
From urbanism, this project is relatively well justified.
There is a urban space that – if it is believed in the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
S21 is nervous for the rail transport system.
The passage guard and the expansion of the section are designed for a trafficking of persons assigned - and it is typical for the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time it was not the competitive of the good market flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on the strengthening of goods traffic because rail transport is much more respectable than by road vehicle.
But the new trailed, with his inclinations, does not correspond to goods trains.
S21, and this is much more seriously involved in other rail projects indirectly.
For example, six billion euros will be entered into the Soab project.
That's the official number.
Experts think that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade, this money will miss for other points of joining and enforcement in the network.
The list of the Department of Transports mentions in any sixty large projects.
One of the most important ones is the expansion of the section through the Rhin Valley of 180 nine kilometers.
Since 1987, this line is built in the random.
It would be really urgent to support here on the champion.
But the S21 project makes the effect of a shipping sabot.
In the Rhin Valley, it is in the way to become the extreme routine of international goods traffic, and it is in full heart of Europe.
The Government examines the court made on the airport
In Wiesbaden's regional Parliament, the Government of the country called for the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court on the prohibition of night aircraft.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDD/FDP coalition was responsible for examining experts on the legal point of view the judgment made by the Administrative Court and that is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Cassel Court had justified in a written document that the country should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the case or the project of construction of the Northwest Aeroport station from the Frankfurt airport would be achieved.
The authorisation to switch at 17 flights between 23 and 5 mornings, as the country's government considers, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night aircraft.
The coalition should have decided for 4 January if it wishes to make a sentence in cassation against the sentence made.
The critical opposition of this period and tries to press the representative of the Government so that the circumcision to be sent to the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig.
The head of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gumbel invited the CDP and the FDP to return to their promise before the elections, which was to ban the night flights.
It's very difficult to be allowed to keep his words, said the head of the Tarek Al-Wazir Verts by making the allusion to the FDP slogan "We keep our promises".
The Minister Dieter Posch reaffirms the claims of Schäfer-Gumbel who claims that the Government of the country is trying to authorize even the night flights by using "the lawyer and robbery."
There is time to carry out a specific legal review.
Coalition does not want to make decisions on the basis of a "prime fast impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition on the statements of his fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely enhanced.
American banks repay the granted aid
The large American banks, which are very touched by the crisis, are deployed from their link to the State.
The Bank of America announced merry that it had completely paid $45 billion to the Tresor for more than 30 billion, corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp Safety Plan.
The CNBC American TV chain reported that Citigroup also intended to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to slow down tax restrictions, which comply with the acceptance of the nets, such as the limitation of the good assigned to the leader and the higher cost regulation.
The Bank of America launched an increase in capital by sales of heads to investors who reported to him $19 billion.
The rest of the sum provides boxes of the bank that are well filled with the sale of several other sectors.
Mercredi last night, Kenneth Lewis, Director-General of the Bank of America, had expressly grateful for the US contributions: the capital injection was significantly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had summarized its capacity by saving the Merrill Lynch investment bank as the most strongest of the financial tour.
The Citi-Gruppe also intends to provide money on financial markets in order to be free of the entire State.
The US bank could thus start a capital increase of $20 billion since Thursday, reported the CNBC chain quoting banking environments.
The Citigroup's talking port did not want to comment this information.
In June the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had paid the public funds they benefited.
Acceleed election
Finally, everything happened even soon than planned.
Another two weeks after the removing of the current editorial post Nikolus Brender by the German Administration Board of ZDF Chain, the follower is already appointed.
The Committee wished to vote last night for the appointment.
Peter Frey, who directed the Berlin edition of ZDF, was the great favorite.
However, the chain did not want to confirm - officially - the vote to not anticipate the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also the will that the ZDF Markus Schacher should not be accepted by the Administration Council.
Frey, who was the candidate of Schacher, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known in the closure of the edition.
Two weeks ago, Schacher had proposed the Governing Council to extend the contract of Nikolus Brender for five years, but that was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council were favorable to Brender's revision and others voted against, and Brender's vote by vote represented a degree that was not expected for Schacher.
Indeed, the CDU that is major to the Administration Council has already heard several weeks before the vote has been voted, did not want to reduce Brender at its post.
This is Roland Koch, the President of the Hesse Land, who had organized a link against the head editor.
He refused that the contract of the very head-editor was extended by calling that the rate of hearing of ZDF information emissions had decreased under Brender.
This is the reason why protests were still held, almost until the vote, shutting the growing political influence on ZDF.
At the end there were even 35 public experts who were employed in the debate and estimated that the way to act in Koch was anti-constitutional.
But that won't serve to nothing.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born 4 August 1957 to Bingen.
He studied the political sciences, the pedagogy and the Roman languages (Spain).
He then worked at the Southwestfunk (Rhenania-Palatinat radio) and Frankfurter Rundstein (Germany national portfolio daily).
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first in the newspaper "hour-journal" (day newspaper).
Then his passenger continued: from 1988 to 1990, he was the member of the headed editor of the time; then, in Washington in 1991/1992, he was head and presented by the "Morgenmagazins" (the morning submitted); until 2001, he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF, then Head of the Berlin edition.
After Brender's disgrace, while it was just to be a journalist of the year by the specialized Medium Magazine magazine, the Verts announced that they would have a constitutional complaint.
Coch's advisor to the Administration Council, the President of Rhenania-Palatinat Kurt Beck, said last week that countries should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty in order to not be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not consider to ask for the retirement of the political personalities of the ZDF monitoring committees.
Peter Frey, likely Brender's poster, had been able to handle with the Governing Council by criticing the Committee with verily in his decision to remote Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schacher was able to propose it for the post of editor-en-leader without losing the face, as well as the Administration Council could elect it without the suspicion of putting a political party at post.
In the arithmical representations of the parties, Frey is left-left free classified.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: After a year of education, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the country decided to show a more conciliation: at a meeting between the Ministers and the Delegates of the Rector Conference, a agreement was made on the point that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to get out of their studies.
In particular, they agreed to raise the weight of the reviews: a single review must allow to closure the selected study module.
Furthermore, workload should be reviewed in order to ensure "real and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate recognition of reviews between universities and foreigners.
Countries also undertaken to organize more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master's branches.
At the regional level, there must not be different regulations from one country to another.
Reviews
Since the beginning of the last June study protests, the Ministers of Education of Countries and universities have stopped speaking to the mode: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to have a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board decided to significantly reduce the number of reviews: "All modules must normally be concluded by a single review," may be read in a document of 30 pages on the future conditions for accession to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, states that, slowly reducing the load of reviews, it should be possible to stop delays, which were significantly disadvantaged for the study.
Studyability should be overwhelming in the future the decisive criteria of the study organization.
The modules, as the background should be carefully reviewed to see if you can't avoid this feeling of shocking that you sometimes feel in the course selection.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor to Goodtenberg (CSU) is inflicted by delegated trompier.
Students should have the possibility and margin of work in order to enable and promote the personal initiative.
The new regulation will apply access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 accreditation agencies on the whole federal territory which depend on the accreditation advice established by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted a certain pressure on countries in order to ensure that the programmes are not too strict and the review regime are not too strict.
In some countries, universities and higher schools have already been heard with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
Rhenania-Palatinat is until now the only country to have given its agreement to provide more means for the development of the Bologne process.
With these funds, universities have to organize tourist programmes to strengthen the Pedagogical Orientation Offices, as well as review offices and international relations services
Countries and universities prescribe a budget of EUR 10 million.
Starting 2010, the Government wants to submit to Parliament an amendment to the Legislative on Higher Education institutions.
Following this, only one review should be carried out to closure its studies.
The organization of studies must be more flexible, moreover, it must be able to ensure the recognition of the notes from other higher education institutions and the access to the Master.
From the end of the next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles will be examined.
On Thursday, the Government and opposition again discussed the issue of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated but critical have been heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said that it would like the organization of educational policy to go back to the future to "the closed doors" of Ministers and universities.
After education, students as interested persons should be able to express a little.
The future diplomates of higher education are received the support of the President of the Delegated Delegations of the Conference of Delegates (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of students is very useful" said she Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Countries with which the HRK works on a common reform project.
For the Union of Education and Sciences (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn are not enough. He claims the right and possibility for each Bachelor deplored to register to a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller member of the CEW Directorate Committee also requests the countries to ensure today's students to Bachelor, that there will be enough places for Master's studies and conditions of study as well as possible.
The countries, therefore, have to build more course loads.
Instead, the Ministers of Education did not suggest the possibility of enhancing access to the Master.
More than one page note on Herta Müller
It's through these words “Arrivée in Germany and it's very nice, almost more control...” that begins a work of the Poet Werner Söllner, in which he thematicizes the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany, who won the freedom but lost his language territory at the same time.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucarest and, afterward, director of collection in a house of edition for youth before installing Francfort on Main.
Söllner received several literature prices; in 1993 he had the very conviction of poesie from the Goethe University of Francfort and since 2002 he was director of Hesse's literature forum at Mousonturm's artist house in Francfort.
He had much talked about him in last Wednesday non-literarian circles, at a Congress in Munich, which was the theme "The German literature in Romania in the sight and the deforming look of your Securitate folders."
Visiblely destabilized and generous, Süllner made a statement in which he acknowledged his German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Womendorfer, who had cooperated as an informant for the Security Political Political Police.
Süllner received in 1989 the price of the German language together with some of the participants.
Experience tests were initially started in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner “It is why someone who has not enough to resist trials of intimidating the Security”.
The poet Werner Söllner is Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoration of the Nobel price for Herta Müller and its exemplary literaries with the dictature power mechanisms, the literary scene is broken and, in particular, the community of German authors originating in Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and the lowest of a political system, based on police monitoring and sponsoring.
Werner Söllner is, as it can be said according to current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Securitate dossier, IM Walter played a role, ensures the literature specialist Michael Markel after the condemnation of Söllner and returns to the positive impact of IM Walter who had interfered in his favor.
"He could take him out of all the difficult situations at the time," said Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before this public was unexpected, however, it was not so surprised to have a former dissident of his collaboration with Roman secret services.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the Securitate's spots had already written Herta Muller in July in the Di Zeit, after reading the 914 pages of his own file.
It may be expected that the victims will have speculations and sometimes cause what real names have been hidden last the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
On the contrary to Germany, where the consultation of the Stasi dossiers is a reliable process, the attitude towards the heritage of the security dossiers is still very confused.
Systemic clarification has been unlocked and frozen in the past years.
Only in 1999 a national council that corresponds to the Birthler institution was created to work on the archiving of the Security Archives (CNSAS) but the refund of the dossiers has been soon passed.
Since 2005, there is a law which defines the archiving management.
The influence of old members of the Security Security in Romania is still very large, it is confirmed by the interview of an elderly responsible for the Teenesvar Security that, after the announcement of the Nobel Price transfer to Herta Müller, he expressed in a decent way towards the laurate.
She had a psychologist, and finally we asked him only one time.
The famine of power thought it could be possible to express here, without any gene, under the cover of the freedom of expression.
Certainly, many inelectable questions are associated with the case Söllner as this is so often occurd in a hidden guilty context.
Why now? Who has been spoiled? The shocked reaction of auditors, with Söllner, lets hope that the follow-up of this chapter will be more defined by a smile of knowing than by accusions and feeling of pain.
On the genesis of Herta Muller's work, who received the Nobel price yesterday, is more than one note on page.
Tumpets at the League Champions
It was the impression that a representative came there, shooted to four edges of all the right of a celebration of a sympae, on which the manufacturer of sports articles had stolen his goods when the new trainer of Christian Gross mounted at least the quarter in a Mercedes Class C, which was just called, a other platform sack of the supplier on the hand.
The man, whose clan key would attract the attention, left to the city that was still foreign.
On the other hand, our fifth would have been able to take himself the flight – he had no alcohol and he wasn't able to have happiness.
He had been a nice evening, but tomorrow he had to get back to work.
Because now it's going to be starting.
The words of the Swiss that we had come to join three days earlier were clear: “We have reached the eighth end”, which is, in the link of chambers thanks to our 3:1 against the Unia Urziceni of Romania,” but we do not have to let us overcome the success. This will be a brutal battle to not turn back”.
The "great work" is waiting for the Sunday.
Here, it is to repeat the results of the champion link to daily.
And the weaknesses that were referred to on the surface after the three sending objectives of Marica (5.), Trish (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Storage to sort
The eighth end of the Champions League Championship (match go 16/17. + 23./24 February/ match return 9./10. + 16./17 March) will be shooted on December 18th to Nyon.
The joy of the full functional entry of the successor of Babylon was so modifyed.
And the joy was not only modified in those who had brought chance, who had transmitted to the destabilized professionals of Stuttgart, an unfair motivation and the joy of playing.
I've been seeing the players and I told them that they should focus on their instruments, I advised them to be more courageous, explaining the "smuggler of the souls" – Gross - the receipt of success that sounded so much that had no more effects with the Babbel career.
He launched a certain magic, announced Jens Lehmann - part of Babylon, "and the foot when there is a new impulsion, it sometimes happens things that we would never have believed possible."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of suspension for fertility, advanced the best player through its dynamicism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" identified by a proverbial "frees wind" and the method of work of the new chief: "It is someone who passes to action and requires discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babylon had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart hasn't passed the head, guarded by the Horst Heldt manager
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs especially tenacy.
As Gross, players and managers remain well assessing the victory against a totally overwhelmed defence and disappointed Roman invitations.
They also won in Glasgow before having four days later a bad wave in Leverkusen with 0:4, Khedira object.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had reached one of the season objectives but that there were others who were still far.
We haven't passed the hard cap yet.
That Heldt's day of his 40th anniversary did not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first weekly victory since three months, is from the events of the weekend that a television interview of the guard of but Jens Lehmann had been bonding just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others take, not Jens, against Heldt, in response to Lehmann's accompanying criticism.
He had accused the direction of style weakness and said she had decided to change trainer under the pressure of puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousial since his day of free after the matches was removed.
Lehmann's statements were “marked by a clean selfish” funded Heldt and announced the consequences of the goal guard.
They couldn't become friends for their lives.
In all cases, they were agreed to all the rest, namely, that without the previous work of the group by the replaced trainer, the strong sportive and combating representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “for a large part in success”, they returned Heldt and Lehmann in the sweet – and even the man in the plastic shoes acquired.
World weight Championship
The warm battle in Berne: Kevin Johnson the challenged it was unexpectedly and normally the world's Championship Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds, Ukraine defends the title of the world's chain of heavy weight according to WBC Federation.
On the one hand, the judges were imposed on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko maintains its title of the world's weight champion.
The WBC Federation announced that in the Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had brought a victory to the one-time of judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time, Klitschko defends his title since his headback on the scene in October 2008.
Before Ukraine had already reported the title of the WBO and WBC Federations two times.
Unfortunately, he did not have the KO so waited.
Klitschko, slaughtered 39 times in 41 professional battles, has two times declared his fault because of wounds.
The challenger Johnson has to accept his first fall in the 24th battle.
In the Berne Aren, before 17.000 spectators, the Great Klitschko was especially wanting to dicte the battle from the top of his 2,02 meters from his left.
Johnson, of 11 centimeters smaller that had announced the end of the Klitschko era, succeeded in avoiding the cuts of the champion, so Klitschko tried to enter his game against harmful right.
Johnson, too passive to a challenge, especially tried to pass through the rounds.
Although he continues to provoke Klitschko in words and skins, his shoes were only very rarely reaching the champion.
It is even the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, over the distance of the 12 rondes exceeded with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of fun in the capital of Switzerland before the battle.
He insultated Klitschko the treaty of a "zombie zombie" who is not really capable.
During the Wednesday, the champion was not able to prevent Johnson by making him cut off his nest sunlight "to see his eyes".
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko was again imposed at his fourth battle since his rear back on October 11, 2008
After a pause of almost four years, he had struck the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and restored the WBC ceinture that he had previously left without fight.
This year, defending his champion title, he reverses the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola from the United States.
"I just took a shock in this battle and I'm in perfect form," said Klitschko to explain his rapid return to the ring.
His relief is trying to join the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is Champion of WBO Federations and IBF.
But it's the British David Haye, who, covered the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, takes the WBA's ceinture.
This was, Haye had canceled a match against Vitali Klitschko that had been held in September.
It seems that his promotion company intended to play this match now at the Wembley stage in London.
The Kunduz case
On the front of the opposition: the head of the Parliamentary Group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of the Goodtenberg defence of lies in the case of the Affaire Kunduz.
The SPD and the left (the left) parties request the chance of explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - after reviewing the last information on the aircraft of Kunduz, the opposition repressed the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor to Goodtenberg (CSU) to have discussed some of the facts.
The Minister intentionally "formed a contraverty" on the murdering band of two cytern trucks in September, said the Chief of the Parliamentary Group of the Verts, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the ERD Chain of "Tagsview".
Of course, this means that he lies.
The order to kill was given to the total unprecedented rules of the International Security Force in Afghan (ISAF).
This is the content of the NATO report, which has been read by Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Thursday, according to new media revelations, the target of the fleet was in reality, not to destroy the buried trucks, but aimed to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people had been killed or blessed during the American aircraft attack which had been launched at the request of the Dutch Countries Goerg Klein, Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left requested the Chairman Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak in the shortest terms before the Federal Parliament and to find out what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague of the Great Renate Künist are viewed that Mrs. Angela Merkel should clearly tell whether the targeted masturbation strategy is part of the Afghan Government's Afghan government policy if the happiness, military and information services have approved this new strategy.
The Government ' s speaking port rejects these criticisms.
The happiness has not influenced armed interventions in Afghanistan, said it.
On Saturday, votes were more stronger to express doubts about the real reasons for the return of the Inspector-General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as was presented by the Ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper information, the information they had issued to Goodtenberg on the attack of Citrus trucks was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have dismissed the existence of the NATO report and hidden the Minister some generic details.
In the course of the two high officials, however, they have heard that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of Colonel Klein and a military police report.
The "Frankfurter General Suntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had in time requested a clearing of facts in a mail.
Until now, he has not received answers
On Saturday, the Ministry did not want to comment these accuseds and return to the federal Parliament's investigation committee that would be the next Monday to bring the light on the facts concerned.
The Song Worlds
Some see, all overwhelming, pictures and hear voices that no one else sees no one or hears.
There is no only in psychic diseases, or under drug effect, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena appear during the sleep, it's okay.
When we're long in our assuming rooms, we can give us the most crazy dreams and fantasms.
However, who, smiling, makes experience of dream state, hears and sees things that others do not understand, quickly have the reputation in our western world of being crazy or drugd, or at least a original.
Such images and voices are not only in psychic or under the effect of drugs.
It's our imagination that is in question: it's the same neuron activity that allows us to design houses, painting tables or write romans, but it sometimes encourages the limits between dream, fool and reality to be found.
A conscious state, taking the form of a dream, can be presented under the most different forms, in the best cases, this is called visions, in the worst of the fool.
But even if the decreetor and the effects differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard van Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the calls, psychos and hallucinations are very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or deliver when equilibres, neuro-transmitting substances of the brain - in the first place, dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonine and aquelcholine - are broken and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is perturbed.
Complete hallucinations and delivering thoughts are often shown during a shysofrenic psychosis.
The earthquake force has no power on the person.
Since antiquity, philosophies and doctors have always been struck on the relationship between fool and dream.
For Aristote, the hallucinations were a shape of smiling; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatrists, found in 1861 "a great similarity between fool and dream", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychist with all irregularities, imaginations, deliverations and sensual illusions".
We are in the autumn 2001 when Henning T becomes a personalized band.
His body is in two sizes of creating colours.
The earth attraction has no more power on him, he plans at the root of the platform.
He feels a shock.
Before him, the creatures of ailable demons, grimming, the instant mouth, showing the dents.
They continue him, give him shocks with sweet flamboy shoes, smell him against the walls, he smells pain in the whole body.
Sounds angry, wicked, hurling, out of walls and radios.
He can't support these voices that insulte and humble.
Henning T. strikes two cables from his stereo chain, in fact a ball and attacks it to a platform-based crack.
He goes on a bathroom and goes around the shock.
He's sweet.
The ball is down.
If this serves you of lesson, they shouted the voices in a heart to smile him. "Go in a clinic and take care!"
Today Henning T. to 40 years of age, he lived six acute psychoses, the last two-year date, the first 20-year-old age.
She was disabled by LSD.
Diagnostic : psicso-affective, paranoid, in addition, it is maniaco-depressive, he takes medicines against depression, hand, skizofrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he was married for three years.
During psychism I lived terrible fears and deep desires.
Illusion is a cruel reality.
A percentage of the population suffers at least once in his life of skizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common disease after depression.
In a crysophornia crisis, the persons concerned cannot make the difference between the internal world and the outside world, they are in an exciting state of hyper, which makes it possible to suffer hallucinations, megalomania, relative folie or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices commanding, commenting or dialoging.
Optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned can't make the distinction between the important and the insignifiant, the brain can't filter the distorting signals, the conscience is shocked under the feelings.
Like the dream, psychologic opens the excluses to a slight of ideas and fantasms brings the deepest beds of conscience.
The perception of reality in psychosis was based on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, Hedelberg's Head of Psychiatry Division (General Psychiatry in Universitysklinikum).
The sczophrene is in full center of the situation, with a meaning covered on it.
At the same time, he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is the reason why Schyzophrene often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the possibility to adapt the reality, illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
Do experience once in his life of hallucination.
According to Fuchs, "the sensitive and spatial structure of the reality that is perceived during the psychosis is fundamentally preserved."
Delivering thoughts and hallucinations are based on the reality, the alliance of life is in a real framework.
Why our brain does this kind of horses, it's always an enormous for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everybody to lose the perception of the reality, according to Fuchs.
But just a few people will develop a psychology.
It seems to have a genetic predisposition to the skizophrenia, but studies on jumeal have shown that genes are not the only determinant factors.
The researchers believe that the persons concerned are present incredibly cerebral lessions.
The neuron maturation of the brain is supposed to be a premature stage of development, for example by a mother’s viral infection during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But what remains still unexplied is the way the neuron system's anonymization is produced and overwhelming the fact that it does not appear for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience may be a psychological decline, however, if there is predisposed.
Similarly, hallucinogen drugs can deploy psychoses because they act on neurotransmiters.
When our brain is heat.
What's stupid, we say the professor of Psychiatology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychologists suffer from their hallucinations and take medications to defeat it while others buy strong drugs to sell it.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusion is often just a point of view.
Kasten has assembled the reports on hallucinations and illusory images for ten years: last year he published his results in a book titled "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are well part of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychos, but also of a countless number of other pathologys.
The psychological disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migration, epilepsia, plaque sclerose, Alzheimer's disease or chronic traumaism.
It is surprising to see that in some conditions even the brain of healthy persons is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the brain areas that treat sensitive perception are hyperactive or not sufficiently refreshed; when our brain is heating but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can disable this state as a brain lesion or psychose.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, love chagrins or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, a third of the participants recognized having done at least once in his life the experience of hallucination.
In 2005, Sarah K. at 16 years, she lived in a small town of Mecklemburg-Pomerian, and she went to school.
A young girl is going to make it normal to say.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recreation, a young boy, mysterious, at the long hair of the chain, gives him the word.
When she answers her friends look at her, they're surprised - no one else sees nor hears this boy.
They think that this tired young girl is a lunatic dream, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She's washed, listening and seeing this boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sit next to her on the bank.
It may even see its presence in time.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds that young sympathy.
I'm fool, sometimes asking her.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The night appears in general.
Remember visions are weak.
When it is in class, it is possible to follow the course because the teacher is just in presenting a new student in his eyes and ears while it is invisible for others and the teacher is visible in explaining equations in the table.
The night appears in general.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that arrives too rarly and too late, she can not often do the distinction if it is washed or dream already, if the images that she sees, the griming faces or the young girl with bloody snakes on the arms and feet are in front of its open or closed eyes.
Let me calm, cry to these creatures.
She's not talking to her parents or friends, they would take it for a fool.
On Monday 2009. Sarah K. has 20 years today.
She had her bag last year and she lived with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she went into contact with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well she's not foolish.
The fool is also an art work of hope.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulations, the probability is great that he has hallucinations in the end of a certain time.
I think that the brain isn't enough occupied, so that there is an animation.
Sarah K., the only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was small and often played all of them.
Her hallucinations started when she was 13 years old, that the man she called her father, since she was age of thinking, wasn't her real father.
These are the same cerebral areas that are active for visual and acute hallucinations, and for real impressions and bruits, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between the illusion and the reality. "All experience," says Kasten "is in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form themselves in the brain, so they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy persons are not fundamentally distinguished from those in acute psychosis.
In the contrary to the sczophrenes, mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasms are not real images.
This is why Kasten advises his patients to love hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our too much-centred world, we are unfortunately tending to take imaginative experiences for pathology, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Head of Psychiatric and Psychiatric doctor of the Hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychiat is a serious, painful disease, but also contains something positive, creator - the fool is an art of hope.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called oniroid, a special form of change of conscience by the dream.
Oniroids vercus are very complex semi-revets that are perceived as real by the living one and that it can't differ from the dream even when it is in heavy state.
Oniroid conscience is demonstrated during traumaism or in extreme pathologys, such as patients who are fully conscious of polyradiopathy, makes experience of a motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and world, due to a total and sustainable moveable incapacity, he replaces this real situation that leads to his life, by its imaginative world that is disappeared from reality.
It is a mental limit state between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change has occurred but the real situation is represented in imagination.
Indeed, it is an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation, an organizational capacity that is given to us men, not to shame in the loss of conscience.
Everything is real even later in the memorys.
Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, artist of art describes also his oniroid experiences in his book "Cary of Heart" as an action to save the soul.
He has 49 years of age when his conscious part for a trip of several days after the operation of a cardiac valve followed by a transplantation; during that time his body is condemned to remain immobile in reanimation.
Claussen slows in a world that he created all parts, visits foreign places, travels in time. He sees in an old man alive in a rail sanitary, a robot to his horse watching his health.
He lives at the middle of the age among nobles that produce drugs on blood.
He is removed by a Greek moto that brings him to his country, survives with his hospital bed in the neighbor of the Alpes and meets a mafious Korean.
It is completely absorbed in this imaginative world, everything is real even later in his memorys.
According to Clausen, these internal trips are fundamentally different from all dreams.
The dream is a very different state, writeing what he lived.
Instead of dreams, memories from mind travels are extremely clear and very detailed even the years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and intensive than real life.
The intensity of this life makes the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oniroid delires, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our internal representations of the external reality are even in ill state.
Any change in the state of conscience, the psychologist Kasten "is possible to cause a deformation of what we call the reality."
A experience that can also be really rich.
The first necks may fall
Burden
To 27 years, children will take the post of the house of editions.
The appointment of Kallen at the PDG of Burda editions is a intermediate solution: Hubert Burda wants to take the press group, said to the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding must remain at 100% a family company.
Hamburg - In long term, the editor Hubert Burda sees his company among his children's hands
The two children will have 27 years of age and are strongly decided to integrate the company, said Hubert Burda, 69 years old in Spiegel.
All details were resolved in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will be taken later.
We should also see if they are capable of it.
It cannot be imposed to 7500 collaborators without knowing whether they have the ability to take care of them.
This would democrate children and the company.
Burda had known on Thursday last day that he would take place from President-General since January and that his post was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Karen, 52 years old, is a member of the Administration Board since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technological sector.
Then he was employed by the Tresor sector, to say that he was responsible for the company's capital and after Jürgen Todengrandfer's department, he also took the head of the marketing, foreign sector, print and finance.
So for the first time, it is not a family member that is headed by the Burda editions.
Burda's children were 19 and 17 years old, her son Felix, who had 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also serves to do the link of the next 10 or 15 years."
Burda precisely states that the holding must remain at 100% among the family hands.
The ruin has always occurred in families that have left to be income by a capital bolimia, which have made huge spills, thinking that they could still blow up.
This has never been my strategy.
I never have dreamed universal power, said Burda.
I do not absolutely see myself in the role of the country's preceptor as it could be Springer and I don't intend to be part of these international links like the Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Integral beauty
All you can want, in the area of beauty and well-being, to handle.
This is the same goal as the English Court, which has come to anaugurize in the Commercial Centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to care and attention to the body.
The spa, situated at the eighth stage, opens prestigious teachers like Hedonai, Laser epilation specialist, Spaxion, with its relaxation and ethical treatment rooms, Luis & Tachi, coiffers, Marina d'Or, which has a sport room, or Western and its natural cosmetics, among others.

Everything starts with the introduction of your personal code on a tactil screen, situated in front of the device.
several videos then show us how to correctly implement our exercise programme.
His director ensures that 15 minutes (heating and eating), which are sufficient to work all the muscles of the body.
And if we have done our body, we want to pass through the coiffure room, the teacher Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer hair repair rituals, lightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusiveness seem to have been the order words of this urban space, which will be open every day from 10 a.m. to 22 p.m.
Variated collections
Christmas approaches and it's never superflu to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party guard.
The form of decoration, very important to put the silhouette in value, is one of the variables we need to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
Fergie's paint has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decollency. This is not very advised.
Finsa and Barcelona, with electric car
The Finsa Electricity company, in collaboration with the Barcelone Board, created the LIVE Office.
This is a project to develop and promote electric vehicles in the Catalonia capital.
The ‘LIVE’ Office will define and coordinate the road sheet for electric vehicles in the city and will establish mobility agreements by performing, coordinating, providing subsidies, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric vehicles, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to start what will become the transport of the future.
3 ‘Electric cities’
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
This is three cities chosen by the Government in the MOVELE Plan to launch electric vehicle installation.
The Endsa Electric Company has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitate of Catalogne.
It is aimed at promoting research and technological development activities in the Catalogne's autonomy Community.
Among these are energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Finsa participates in the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company participates in standardization groups at the European level and has undertaken a set of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero entered “a future of calmity” for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, entered "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish car industry that, remembered, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the Government ' s Chairman, Zapatero recalled the implementing measures launched during the year to support the automobile sector.
"No Competitiveness Plan of the Car Sector, we had today a landscape of abandon, closed by some of our main production sites," stated the President of the Government.
“We can consider a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector, thanks to this plan and to the decision to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector,” he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, including the Integral Plan for the Mobile Sector (PIA), had allocated 800 million euros to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 assistant companies, which mobilized an investment of more than EUR 3 million.
The Executive Chief explained that this investment was intended to develop new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the Government's support measures in the 2000E Plan in cooperation with autonomy communities and automotive enterprises.
According to the President, this plan allowed 6 per cent of the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in Spain and contributed to a strong increase in registration, which made progress in November by 40 per cent.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Collection Salon, a meeting space for the professionals and the sweeters of the engine world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Cristal Pabellon of the Campo House of Madrid.
It is a exposure surface of 20 000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exposures will be presented.
It is not only possible to find motorcycles and collection cars, but it will also be found in ClassicAuto Madrid in any kind of items related to the engine world.
Thus, in the field exhibition, we can find accessories, rechange parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectioners and curious collectioners.
Among the participating companies, we will find Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car rental specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restoration, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of cars, or Cochera Classico, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Externe approximation test
But the commercial activity of this room will also include parallel activities: assemblies, sports exhibitions, availability tests, presentations and concours.
Availability tests with cars and collection motorcycles will also be carried out on an adjusted circuit outside the exposure park.
Mazda3 i-Stop : Sustainable sports spirit
Mazda means to prove that the sportive spirit is not failing with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has been integrated in Mazda3 the motor stop and starting system, baptized in i-Stop, a device which, at least for now, is available only on Engine 2.0 to 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 illustrates the good note she reached in its whole.
Detailation, finalisation of the vehicle, housing, behavior, mechanic, i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are noted on the new Mazda3.
Starting by the conducting position, the front seats would be presenting an ergonomic and excellent fixing.
The flight toucher is also particularly pleasant to him.
Continuing with the whole form of the control table and the console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a future inner design, with many buttons and commands, as well as red and blue colours.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
This is why we can say that Mazda3 is well that Civic, both Japanese, is in contrast with the sovereignty of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to overcome.
In continuing with the accommodation, this Japanese car is more comfortable than enough to allow four adults to travel with a higher comfort level.
Add to all this a great cover to regular forms.
The engine's automatic stop and starting system, at least for now, is only available on the engine of two litres and 150 horses and with manual change of six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. He illustrates by his finish, low sound, performance and management of his consumption.
In fact, although the most requested Mazda3 are the diesel models, those who do not perform a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with the essential engine, both for its large speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the selected model for the test is the Sports, otherwise it presents the largest number of series elements.
Between the series of machines, the switch-changing assistant (RVM) which removes the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the sensitive inside view, the board computer on a large screen, the stationing capteurs, the independent climateization, the plug and light captor, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio, as well as the 17-minute alignement routes, are particularly remarkable.
Furthermore, as if this equipment was not enough, this version of the Premium Pack that includes the other elements of adaptable bi-xenon pharmaceuticals and a BOSE audio system with disk loader.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of its best compact cars.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not much kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the switch engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only inconvenience of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the end of Luxury and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sport.
In contrast to this important amount, Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
"Prima" of luxury
L.A. Recover the red mass of sensuality incarned by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have more than ever blewed, stones of so elegant models than sexy for the outdoor of Nine. (Fotos : Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", sophisticated as well as dwelling, had opted for a dark "Lady".
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, this is a device that only allows to look at its e-mail, without offering the possibility it would only be to see some type of joint parts or to navigate on the Internet.
He benefited from his five minutes of glory to the United States when the Time magazine was designated as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see it in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for youth.
In contrast to the Smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, or not less than half of what is costing, for example, the data subscription of iPhone.
With the success, the company launched two new devices: one design only for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, for six times more than Peek.
FonPeek, presented last night at the Web event, is the European invent version and its third incarnation.
It's so limited as his grand-american brother, but it's a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes routing throughout Europe.
Those traveling with a Smartphone already know what represents the fact that it is to reject the data when it is crossed or searched for an WiFi coffee (or a Fon connection) to consult his email.
The idea of a rolling to a fixed price is incredibly sweet and it makes it work as long as it works.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but in me, I should have made a physical thesis to understand them and good lunettes to read the small characters.
Remembers of the European Commission to propose approachable roaming tariffs in all Europe have been in a sense of perceived effect.
In the outside of its country of origin, the data are able to use, and it is not wrong.
What a small piece like the FonPeek (this is always curioso that it is called Fon when it does not have Wifi) offers this type of tariffs, it means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals for them to restore their data network.
Childle is another good example, he understands downloading books and other Internet research.
No subscription and no gallery.
This is a connected device and is payed for its purchase and not each month.
And that's what I hope to see a day for the FundPeek: a purchase option with life access as Peek has already been proposed to the United States.
I don't want to buy it.
I'm looking at my e-mail on my phone, thank you.
I simply want it because I think it is a more fair form for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system.
The favorite color of Michelle
The yellow is certainly the color of the first woman of the United States.
If it was taken by Barack Obama to the President of the United States with a routine and a mantel of this color, she actually chose the same to join it in the second moment, without doubt, the most important of her life: the transfer to Oslo of the Peace Nobel price.
Michelle Obama had a very likely model in these two occasions: in addition to their like color, a yellow shooting towards the green with brilliant reflections, both times the holding was composed of three parts: clothes, clothes and mantels, in the same tissue, and was ored by a large brodery or a collar.
Although a first shock of eye, it seemed to be the first woman of the United States to follow the slaughter of the Prince of Asturies and had chosen to return the same holding.
But the tissue in which the two assemblies are cut makes them very different.
If it was a dentist, instead, she carried a printed speed to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green house shoes for the first time, and a similar model, but do, this time.
The coiffure also changed: the hairs are now highlighted while it was left by them as previously.
75% of working mothers had professional problems because of their mother
Labour discrimination has increased in the past few years, especially for young generations who want to be mothers.
That's what reveals the study “Fecondity and professional career of women in Spain” carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women Institute.
The survey, conducted by 9 737 women from 15 to 75 years of age, does not doubt: 75 per cent of the mothers working have seen their limited professional career because of maternality.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the start of couple life and the number of children, if women are working or not, and the type of employment.
Those who have no activity outside the home, have part-time work or have a little stable job, set up in a couple early, have their first pregnancy and have more children.
Instead, women with stability employment, mainly in the public sector, refuse to enter into a couple and first pregnancy, and have less children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age have been fixed with their first child at average 3,7 years after being installed in a couple. This number is 4.1 in those working in the public sector. “This data shows that women with a stable job have needed more time in their life to get it, which brought them to retreat the unity and arrival of children.
Furthermore, the type of employment has been largely influenced by maternity, but less than the date of common life", explains the CSIC Margarita Delgado's research.
The level of studies is another factor that crosses the difference in the age of women's marriage and their first childhood.
According to the survey, the higher level of training is, more they are married and have their first child late.
The difference also remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, primary and higher studies were mothers for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 years in average.
“Another discernment appears also among women, according to their level of study.
While elementary studies have been married and their first child before finding a stable job, those who have made a medium or higher study invert this program and give the priority to obtain a stable work as a prevailing condition for marriage and arrival of a child," says Ms. Delgado.
Diane Kruger also the good value
Oreal Paris has come to add a new name to his jalous list of ambassadors : Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actor will infiltrate the image of several brand products, pointing out the universal rate “for I do well”.
Joyeux Christmas protagonist, one of the most elegant actors of the international scene, is thus joining other celebrations in the Oreal Paris, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before it, the last ones to be paid in this club if selected were the Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto actors (Slumdog Millennium).
In men, the cosmetic mark also contain luxury embassy: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in Lost).
The prices of the British Mode
The Britishs have much to say in the mode world.
His largest representatives, creators and mannequins, at the Royal Court of Justice, were meeting for the annual transfer of their prices, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed you.
The ex-mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chooses Best mannequin of the year.
Manuel Vincent's poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Ass Pocker (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a thirty-third of "radiographies" of writers who crossed his literary life (and sometimes, their other life).
It does not according to the predictable and appreciative kinds (biographic, life and work summary), but is looking for something like the noyau of creating personality.
The trip is exciting, and Vincent does not spare no frauders or illuminations.
Good joy, this book is also an encouraging invitation to reading and recreation.
I'll leave you here some instantaneous.
On Albert Camus: “In its pages, I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical cleaning, even if I felt without the name: the joy against the famine, the moral without guilty and the innocence without God.”
About Samuel Beckett: “The Nihilist, the Alegoric Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between imputence and ignorance, with a poetic humor that was sweet in sense, such as the lamb of the kitchen that didn't kill him.”
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that was thirty years old, in the flesh of which he conjugates the emotion of adultery to the satisfaction of the remnant, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching the heaven by the way of perdition. "
About James Joseph: “Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be graved by the northern face, on which the best alpinists still slow and take.”
On William Faulkner, "This was a strange guy.
In itself, he sometimes said he was the heritage of a Territory owner of the comte and other times that he was the son of a black and crocodile.
These two dreams were great. ”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This written writer collected the cry from a bridge by this Munch's personality to bring his echo to the bottom of the 20th century's night, in his literary form, and he put it into the fleet of himself and calling the post-periority with a violent talk to the astics."
On Dorothy Parker: “Another day she took herself and a man: “God good loved, I pray you to stop writing as a woman.”
On Joseph Conrad: “On his tomb were slaughtered the verses of Scener: “The sleep after the effort,/ after the temper, the port,/ repos after the war,/ after life, slaughtered the death ravi.”
On Virginia Wolf: “In his bags she also carried his depressions.
His husband accepted very normally that she told him that Edouard VII was epicing it among the shines or that birds were sing in Greek.
There has never been a patient and loved man whose literary talent exceeded the fool.”
Sur Pio Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos if it's not to try to dismiss the Church at Baroja?
What do you try Benet if it's not to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did it do if it is not to be awaiting the glory of this man so that he serves him of piedestal?”
A lack of aggression
Last week, my mother, who had about 70 years, walked in our neighborhood in the town of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed next to her and our dog, a mele blood saved from the SPA and did not weigh more than six kilograms, and without saying, they had two pieces of feet left the dog grieved.
Our abuse is great, because we do not see what there is to be a pleasant to aggressively a small animal without defence that, moreover, was left.
It must be added to the identification of a woman who was tranquilly walking and who, when she harmed these individuals, is in a position to fear for her physical integrity, because an energetic that attacks a animal is able to do the same thing to a woman, a child, an older person or, infinity, any person lower than it.
The episode takes place at 17 hours, a mardi as another, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog's kids all day.
We have heard a complaint to the Commissioner of the neighborhood even if we don't want that it serves to big-choss and not to touch sensitivity, we just want to clarify that the murderers were Spanish.
The identification has brought us to condemn this fact.
We don't understand what happens with youths so they are pleased to harm freely a animal without defense that gives us affection, friendship and holds us company.
We don't know where the good education and respect of animals and persons were carried out.
Michelin and Fesvial, together for the shipping port
The manufacturer of Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of the floor, mainly among the youngest motocyclists, as it has today shown the two structures.
This initiative aims to make aware of the importance of the port of the ship, because it is the only one of protection to avoid blessures to the head, or even the death, in case of accident in two wheels.
Michelin stated that this campaign was inscribed in the line with its commitment to road security, which “besides the design and manufacturing of more secure products”, and claimed that it contributed to this objective by other works in pedagogical and informal nature.
This new shipport encouragement campaign in two wheels, under the ‘Tobe or not to be’, will be a first phase during which spectrums will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the broadest distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road security is a constant concern for the company, because as a pneumatic manufacturer for two road vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop more secure products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles has progressed
After almost two years, the market of light commercial vehicles starts to see a little light at the top of the tunnel.
9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12,6 per cent in 2008, and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 months of consequent reduction, according to the numbers of the Anac and Ganham manufacturers' manufacturers' manufacturers' paternal trade.
The good news should, however, be angry, since the reference to comparison was particularly bad in November 2008, with a decrease of 60 per cent compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the reintegration of the last month, the accumulated records for these 11 months are 40 per cent below those of the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles in the category of light commercial vehicles are added (tracks of tourism, pick-up, frozennets, light flowers and light chassis trucks) 95 853 were sold.
The large clouds that are most affected by their request have not been dismissed, but indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are performed by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay for almost 100 % of cases through external funding.
In addition to restrictions involved in the limitation of bank credits, other factors such as increased unemployment rates or the persistence of bad economic union should therefore be added.
In this situation and in the difference of tourism vehicles, the aid for the purchase of 2000E was few.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs who want to purchase a light commercial vehicle less than 3,5 tonnes with a level of Co2 emissions that is not exceeding 160 kg per km, they may also benefit, but the number of operations speak of themselves.
Last night, at Ganham, it was reiterated the need for the administration to address special attention to these vehicles and industrial vehicles (cames and bus).
The association of grants prescribes a year similar to the end of 2010, for which it calculates a decline of sales (touring vehicles and 4x4) of 19 %.
Emergency help is now binding
As this has happened with the ABS antiblocking system, and how this will be done with ESP stability control, emergency relief systems will be a binding element on European cars.
They are already binding on tourist cars and newly registered commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a car has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measures imposed by the European Union are aimed at strengthening the protection of peetons, even though, by its action mode, it can also contribute to avoid many back shocks.
The urgency assistant acts by increased fresh pressure in the case of emergency detected by the system by the driver's footstep.
But the last does not always keep the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of car components Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident couldn't support the car before the collision, and half of them did not benefit from the whole force.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The aid intervention requires the maximum of the train system, reducing the distance that the car is required to stop.
According to a EU study, if all the cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1 100 mortal accidents in which peetons could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of these smart-free systems: it would be calculated that a four-first left with fertilizers would be avoided.
In that case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, through a radar or a camera, detects the obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to slightly acting on the carriage.
If the driver reacts, he helps it by increased pressure on the pedale, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although collision is inevitable, the device exercises the maximum effort on the goods to minimise damages.
General Motors stays until January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Opel de Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably 8 –, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer said that there will be more time to complete the Opel's backup plan.
Nick Reilly, the new GM Europe's President, believes that each point of the plan has been adopted before the party concerned.
This may include that the final document, which will first be submitted to workers and to the Governments of the country where the plants are found, is reported until the beginning of 2010.
However, with GM, a decision on Saab's sale should be taken in the next days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish Government has renewed the pressure on the American manufacturer so that it takes a decision soon.
GM agrees to be in contact with possible buyers.
One of them might be Geely, who also intends to buy Volvo, but the candidate of the Dutch Sport Skyper manufacturer, supported by the Russian Convergen Group, takes the importance.
In the case of no agreement with them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese Baic company.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
On the flight of Porsche Boxster Spyder
In order to develop their last and precious duty, Porsche engineers went from the Boxster S and successfully slowed it out of nothing less than 80 kilos, which leaves the balance only 1 275 kilograms.
This led them first from the automatic toilet that was replaced by a manual rooftop to reduce 21 kilos, to use aluminium doors such as GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the climate, 13 kilos, to reduce the reservoir from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winning, to mount sport bacteria, even 12 kilos, and with low pounds of 19 pounds, five kilos.
Finally, they refused to the CDR-30 audio system, wining so 6 other kilograms and replaced the doors by tissue pounds, economizing the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the PDK box, the test was carried out on a manual model of six speeds, mainly on roads of the secondary network in the mountains, with particularly turbulent virgins.
His behaviour can only be qualified of irreproachable.
The reduction of weight does not prevent the driving car on the ground with applomb.
On the other hand, it was long that we had not tested such a small and light model that, at the same time, guarantees both security in virgins, including a large speed.
It is a small athlet, capable of switching his muscles to small speed during the necessary time, until we asked him to split, swim, restore and smell his engine again...
This is what we want. Thanks to his direction, as well as to the specific, the car will do what our hands will show on the flight.
And she'll do it with a surgical precision.
Son of a Engine to volunteer
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened by the "sport" option or by a system that changes the switch of the engine, already used on the Panamara.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at the arrest or in the time of recovery.
The suspension is closed, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The revestigation of the roads we travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite slow, but the car was well managed the pool nests.
E-assistants took an act of presence on the whole track, while on some girls we found a small morning and gravities later in the morning.
Finally, a ultra-level car, more divertible to drive and that is much more than a simple change of Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, the icon of the Coco Cocoon line and the occasional shoot of the house's delays, the song shows his face of a bad girl with the same content as his channel sacks.
More than a "Bad Girl" or a "I Girl", it's "Bag Girl".
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Labour Caja has got a triomphe exclaiming 91-82 during his visit on the Arrow Field of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffering from the Dusko Ivanovic team. It is also headed by its group, after the large spectacle of Mirza Teletovic, which, with eight carriages to three points, was the best of his team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team complied the major absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of collective commitment and work, even if she had had to wait until the end to return the victory.
Furthermore, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 carriages with three marked points, widely determined the final victory.
The match began rapidly for the blue and red, which took the advantage since the beginning.
The fact that the first four carriages of the Vitoria team were marked since the perimeter, they were allowed to predict that they were cut on the Israeli terrain with the warm pounds.
English and Teletovic were the main artists of the first quarter.
The second fourth time was on the same tunnel, but the Alava team chose Barac's internal game and Eliyahu's work, which was received by accumulations and applauses to return to his old house, to increase their advantage in the pause (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to note as the best player of his team, with 13 marked points, although the “minute six” evaluation of Splitter had already been expected that this night would not be the best of Brazilians.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the good way to the pause, nothing was played away from there, and the Avala team wanted to remember the Vitoria that it was not so easy to win on their field, and thanks to "the hand of Elias," they could enter the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic's players, blessed but far away from being dead, needed to shoot some skilled action to take the air, and at this time, Mirza Teletovic's channel, who, with three consecutive shops and help of English and Ribas, returned the accounting to a slight score (54-67), and the locals were successful to reach at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team was out to play all over the last period and English and San Emetrio (60-75) suggested that they would not let anyone take what they had merely for the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not appoint and tried to support it since the line of the three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter removed for mistakes, Ivanovic players did not shoot, defended well, and the Israelites were approached during the last minute (80-85), the party was already played and the victory fled to Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Fears prevent the Unicaia of delivering battle
The Unicaya has lost brushly in Greece faced the Olympics, and he gave the head of the Eurolia Group B, when a match marked by the lack of players of the Unicaya, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaga team has not been affected by the environment of the Peace and Amicide pavillon, nor by the rival overwhelming, certainly one of the most powerful of Europe and has a large budget.
The first quarter-time game was allowed to dream the andalouss. A aggressive defense and three chairs with three consecutive points, two of Mr. Omar Cooks and one of the Guillem Rubio who broke the local team 12-18 at the nineth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaya, although the local team's arsenal with the internal game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, was allowed to turn the score 22-20 at the thirteenth minute, at the time of an action, a bagarer start, between the mentors of North American Beverley and Williams, involved the disqualization of the two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing its superiority in the two camps, while the outcome of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal bugs of Carlos Jimenez pained on the Unicaja.
The internal players and the lituan award Linas Kleizas, with their cartworks at three points, crossed the 44-32 advantage at the nineteenth minute.
Unable remount
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympics, who, despite the 19 losses, showed the difference in the meeting held in Malaga 66-48 at the twenty-seventh minute, making the head of the group chance.
The Unicaya tried to overcome the absences and the last outcome of the skooter was shocked by Robert Archibald during the meeting.
Despite all of these problems, Unicaya, thanks to his organization, to Cook Carkers at three points, and Lewis' support, there was a little hope of 66-57 at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was almost impossible because the Olympics were implacable when the players made pressure and showed their suppression in centimeters in the area.
The croata pivot Nikola Vujcic, successfully engaged in relocating the score at 81-62 at the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaya was presented, accepting the winning of the Olympics.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the wage they would pay on the basis of their profile, through a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the most small number of real estate advertisements, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The tool " How much should you be paid?" calculates user payments from more than 140 000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
Since a week that the application works, the research engine found that, in general rule, the Spanish worker “spends wrongly,” explained in a reporter, who is responsible for Trovit’s products, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available by Trouve from his research engines in the United Kingdom and in France, Spanish are less well paid.
A British IT programmer resulted from 45 226 euros per year and a French EUR 31 059, while a Spanish receives EUR 24,000.
Similarly, a driver was 34.247 euros in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 in Spain.
According to Trovi, the latter-governed work in Spain is the server, with EUR 11,592 net annual net, monitored by the seller with 14,725, and the opening work, with EUR 15,667.
In the past three months, Internet jobs are the driver, medium-term jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for Zelaya's start
The Brazilian Government has established a period for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The reversed Chair shall leave the diplomatic ligation until 27 January 2010, date of the official end of its mandate.
Francisco Catunda, the embassy of Brazil in the Honduras capital, confirmed TV Globo that he knows he must leave the embassy, where he is refugeed since 21 September, before that date.
"He has conscious that he must go on January 27, after the exemption of his mandate, he must search for another destination."
The chain also mentioned the former mandate, which confirmed its intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: "My position is to get out as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya by phone.
After the elections of 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the embassy of Brazil until January.
However, the same week he tried to find refugees in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya rejected the state of political enthusiasm that he had claimed to impos the government as chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After raw days since the last spring, in which the infringement of assets constituted the dominant note on the markets, the incertitude is again surprising, which is not surprised because it is their natural status, in a environment where agents take decisions on a future by incertain nature.
The remedie used by the Central Banks to stabilize the markets was to pay debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly providing sufficient liquidity to near zero rates, so that financial institutions purchase assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchase of assets has been practiedly finished and, without dealing with their non-conformable liquidity policy, they start to put a little swimming in the reds, as the ECB has done, with their appropriation for one year in the next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic relaxation without heterodox measures, and we are being assisting in an inverse of risk prime reduction.
Budgets volatility and disappearance of enterprises are again increased, although they remain very distant from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were obliged to socialize the private risk and public debt again affected.
There is again a commitment to the quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been refugees chosen by investors, resulting in an increase in differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was affected by this episode of instability, but then standard & Poor'sa threatened a new review at the lowest qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a bit of incertitude is not bad to stop the defenders of the moral risk, which reiterately tried to cause a conscious case of the world's economic policy responsible who had abolished the destructive effects from the limitation of the credit on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is to decrease a new day of thanks.
However, the situation of Dubai is like a tribal struggle among the emirats to return his place to the power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that deceives a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the rose pool.
Fit in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that the Ecofin would save Hungary from a non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a Member State in the euro area to not respect its commitments.
In contrast, the Ecofin urged the Greek Government to transparency and makes its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope it, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after a few exceeds in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, while our disappearance from public debt increases in the measure of European enterprises obligations, we have no concern.
If European disappearances were reduced and our continued to increase, then it would be a Spanish dydiosync risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anemous. When our predictive indicators obliged most of the studies services to advance their relaxation models and to revise their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the charge of a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it will not have much hope for their warning.
Once again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for now "certainty is the mother of security".
Connected Sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene in the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputy, where the Spain's energy strategy was discussed in these days for the next two decades.
After his intervention, who was followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán asked for the press what he had spoken before the Subcommission at eight clos.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 million euros until 2020 to 60 billion to 2030, where nuclear centrals today operating would remain open.
If not, the necessary investments would not be up to 600,000 million but to 95 000.
On the contrary, Iberdola considers that investment should not be dedicated to increased production capacity, but to the distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue is changed, and the power must be increased.
It is also focused on gas and carbon centrals, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, in particular, renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that more than 18 000 MW are needed, with other “energy energy”.
Galán, who believes that the project of the Sustainable Economy Act that the Government has adopted is in line with what its company claims, did not want to attack the Royal Decree to encourage national carbon consumption, which opposes climate relief policy.
According to him, there is “a clearly long-term balance” in this sense, despite the “pontual” measures, as the president of Iberdrola has qualified.
Whatever it is, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are on a long term, have to be taken, because they take some time before they reach their maturity and that a stable payer framework is necessary for them.
Ferrovial wins the air maintenance market in ten airports
The Swiss company, Ferrovial branch for land airport services, will play the privacy association of the Irish airline Air Lingus for goods services in ten European airports where it is presented.
Paris, London, Francfort or Brussels are part of the most important.
The agreement, whose terms have not been revealed, has a five-year period.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Castilla-La Mancha and Alcalá University of Henares signed a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligence Innovation Centre.
The Alliance prescribes an investment of 20 million to 2012, with 50 % from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be carried out of energy efficiency on authors and airports.
Acciona controversies his first author in Australia in Hochtief and Buygues
Acciona is struggling for its first author in granting in Australia, the market on which it works already as energy and water manager.
The play channel is a tunnel estimated to $1,700 million ($1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to enable Acciona to set up in the country as a company of public and automotive workers.
The city's chief wants to be disposed at the end of 2014.
After having chosen the public/private cooperation (PPP for its initials in English) to conduct the project well, under a business plan under the Tower of Erns & Young, the local administration has already a list of finalists that will be charged by the channel and the operation of the rent.
In the expectation of the submission of their offers in May, the investment planned is $1,700 million ($1,047 million), and in the last phase three consortiums, with a significant presence of European constructors.
The Baptized Transity group is conducted by Acciona, only Spanish company in literature, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian constructors, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists of subterranean work.
In contrast to the Acciona team, it is built the Northern Direct Consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager of Transfield and the French constructor group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has been tested is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (Filiale of the German Builder Hochifica, which is available to its ACS's participation), a local company, Balderstone (owner of the German Birfinger Berger Group) and the specialized gallosis company in public works Razel.
Australian infrastructure market promises great channels and privatizations, but it is a great difficulty if it is not through the acquire of a local construction company.
A strategy that has followed the Hochtical and Bilfinger companies, already mentioned, besides Asian references, and which remains a non-valid step for Spanish ages in the sector.
ACS is worth conquering a market place by its participation of 30 per cent in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton.
Millennium assets
Acciona sets on a geographical area of the most important for the sector, where it has already a large presence through its energy provider activities and the dissolving sector.
Among other actives, it has the largest eolian park, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leaders in the grouping of companies with a budget of 700 million.
It is now intended to consolidate these two areas and to benefit synergies to enter into the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The subterranean road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the Northern Link, is called to link Toowong's western road to the device road to Kelvin Grove (see map) by 4 km from the tunnel. This is the largest project to reduce the traffic in Brisbane.
The calendar established by the administration indicates that the appropriation will be held during the summer 2010 and that the work will begin in December of the next year.
Despite the fact that this pathway will be opened at the end of 2014, the channel is not expected to be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will understand two ways, an electronic packing system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide $500 million for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochific
Australia continues to widely fructify Hochifica, which mentioned last night the obtaining of a contract with the government estimated to 154 million.
The company detained by ACS will equipte, through its local Leighton subsidiary, the infrastructure of the high-level high-fibre national network infrastructure.
This intervention will allow 4000,000 people to have fast internet access and provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company entered the King George Tour construction project in the city of Brisbane. Works have not yet started, and Hochtief concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC can be assisted by a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine filial, will be able to build a tunnel of 2,1 km long for an authorisation in Slovenia, for a amount of 64.5 million euros.
The company has obtained this contract a few days after being seen in the increase of the tunnel of Bosruck (Autriche) for a total of 130 million.
Alpine comforts his experience in the construction of tunnels.
The launch of the channel is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its achievement will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore can help Renfe’s advertising
Renfe has granted advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Mrs. Rushmore, for a budget of approximately three million euros per year, reported the rail operator.
The contract indicates the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was chosen among 16 agents who were submitted to the call of offer organized by Renfe, among which four were finalized, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity during the last three years.
From now, Mrs. Rushmore will be charged by the design and production of campaigns.
Amendment from 63 million to France Télécom to free competition
The French competition regulator has affected a amendment of 63 million euros in France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited the telephone competition by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and by regular consumers' trust programs.
With this sanction, the former French monopolie and state company accumulates more than 450 million euros in amendments since 1994, due to the obstacles that it brings to its competitors.
Inflicted sanctions have also been increased because the authority that ensures competition is considering that France Télécom has committed similar crimes in the past and that it is therefore reciprocal.
Application shop
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephone subsidiary followed the switch of other operators and opened an Internet Application Book, with a view to increased recessions from vote transmission.
At the beginning, the Orange's application trade will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It should be waited for 2010 to arrive in other countries like Spain.
Their participation in the Championship League reported 476,4 million in the Real Madrid and Barza since its creation
The Championship League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, the Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, which was placed in the third and fifth position of the clubs who put the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is head of the list.
Manchester United is head of the list.
Gain the EUFA Championship Liga does not only provide the glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of the large clubs.
Indeed, the competition has shared 5 362,5 million euros to 105 teams (of 12 Spanish) which participated in the event since the development of the tournee during the 1992-1993 season, according to EUFA information.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona were well served at this division.
The white club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for his participation, and the only, with the A.C. Milan, has returned three times the troop.
The catalan club, which is currently the title and last winner of the former Coupe of Europe in 1992, is the fifth of the list.
Headquarters are the Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams who, in addition, funded the most money for their participation in the last Championship Liga.
And that's, though they've lost before the Barza.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, as regards the money reported by the Championship League, although it has reported more titles than any other (5).
Distribution
This paradox appears to be explained by the complex payment procedure applied by the EUFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini is expected to win 1 090 million thanks to the Champions Liga.
In this sum, EUFA will spend 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs participating in the classification matches (including Madrid Atlantics) has received 2.1 million.
Furthermore, those who have been successfully able to participate have received only 3.8 million to be there, with more than 550.00 euros for each debated match.
There is also a bonus in the case of victory (800 000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team), which are arriving in the eighth end of each, eight teams that arrive in the fourth end are 3.3 million.
The last four teams will receive every 4 million.
And the Champion will win 9 million, face to 5.2 receiving by the other finalist.
Thus, as regards fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and at least 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barza was 2.5 million to have reported the Super Coupe of Europe in August.
However, there are variable payments, which are allocated to 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important and has four affected places.
The sample of the previous year is 40% of the money affected, 30% for the second, 20 % for the third and 10 % for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played during the edition of the current year.
New Romasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The New Romasa Group referred to the details of the purchase of actions by which it intends to purchase a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not allow it to start a public purchase offer (OPA) for the totality of the titles.
Concretely, New Romasa offers EUR 1.5025 per action, which will be decreased in 10 years and will be paid to 1 per cent per year for this report.
Sos' actions have been finished at EUR 1.85, and New Rumasa's offer is therefore assessing the company 18 % below the market.
According to New Romasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects Sos' real evaluation.
The offer is provided by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for the shareholders to show their interest in the sale of titles.
CNMV has not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos' company claimed that it had been contacted with the regulator.
If it had happened, the decline would be of 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
By waiting, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to stay outside events of purchase and vault offers and judicially comes from his former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of Mary Luis Jordá as the director of Internal Audit.
A decision that is actually the first woman to take a headquarter in the food company.
This is a newly established post which will depend directly on the President of the Group.
And it is not exempted from poleics, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for more than 230 million Sos to salazar companies.
Furthermore, the possibility that in the next months Sus reveals new fund displacements cannot be discarded.
As regards the credit to Salazar, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) declared yesterday before the National Audit that they had been informed of the displacement of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorises the Paternina exclusion OPA submitted by Inversora Mer
On 9 October, the National Commission for Value Market (CNMV) authorized the Exclusion OPA submitted by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina.
The Supervisory Authority explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms would be adapted to the existing standards and that it would consider the content of the explicit sheet presented in accordance with the amendments applied on 2 December last.
The CNMV indicated that the offering relates to the acquisition of 550 008 action from Federico Paternina to a price of EUR 7,65 per action, which represents 8,95 per cent of the social capital, consisting of 6 142 786 actions granted to negotiations on the bourses of Madrid and Bilbao.
He also explained that 592 778 million actions have been immobilised and that they could not be transmitted before the end of the offer, which stated that the price was established by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these bad days of time and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Each day, thousands of cars that have been taken up a left are returned to a garage, where a expert must evaluate the decay and the cost of reparation.
Each left is different, and the calculation of the peak costs and work time may be a long and complex job.
Calculate the cost of a reparation of EUR 20 000 to 30 000, including the parts and the working hand may take two or three hours.
However, with the assistance of the most recent IT tools, this would be a question of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Service providers and solutions for the evaluation and maintenance are included in the collection of information provided by manufacturers, and then treat them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the North American Group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of estimates are performed with its products.
Other companies in competition in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far away from being simple.
According to Eduardo Velazquez, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
Furthermore, the quantity of data to be treated is still increased, and in the past five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched in the past 15 years.
When a new car goes on the market, these enterprises go to work.
This is a very hard work, since each of the thousands of vehicles must be catalogued and registered.
Furthermore, a "intelligent" graphic image of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a tourist car.
If this is a model sold massively, the work can be prepared in a week if the process progresss very quickly.
If it is a little sold car, it can take three or four months. Actually, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of commercialized cars in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have, for example, information on Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to transport vehicles, the number exceeds 99 %.
To do documentation and development of databases, Audatex has eight shared centres throughout the world (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in some brands.
The national seat is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than hundred technicians (general experts in mechanical experts) are working simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million each year to develop these databases.
Each month, 2,5 million data are registered, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these enterprises to give them a variety of uses and propose different products.
The most common application concerns the reparation and maintenance, but, in accordance with the countries, there are also tools for the management of cash parts or to calculate the value of a car or residue.
The only company that has a guide that refers to the value of the opportunities vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to make a idea of the type of support that it can provide to the professionals of the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the phare product is AudaPlus, the standard solution for the expert evaluation solution.
There are cars, motors, light industrial vehicles and weights.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes account of the reparation time estimated by the manufacturer or the painting bars.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is EUR 5,75, for customers who use it shortly ten times per month.
Then, each insurance company, who performed thousands of experts, negotiates his price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it is out of the mount chain, only thanks to his chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicles green, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the Internet professional sector, which allows to investigate spacious vehicles.
His statistics service is very useful to identify trends, to realize geo-demographical analysis, or to know current problems by mark or model.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a determined mark have been moved to the garage for a pane or how serious wrongs have occurred for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company that is dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It trades, inter alia, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as an access to substances, prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as providers of services and solutions for the evaluation of males, panes or defensors.
The evaluation GT guide is an historical market reference product.
The company works with 24 000 users in garages, 3100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
His business volume increased by 20% per year in the past three years, and it has made an in 2008 EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of the last year, she entered its internationalization process, with the installation of a office in Paris.
On the other hand, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and was implanted in Spain in 1979.
According to the sources of the company, 62 per cent of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38 per cent remaining in North America and South. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33.000 garages, with 3,000 in Spain.

Inquiries on the internet of accidents cars
In October last month, the Solera group purchased Autoonline, a internet platform for sales of cars, words and special cars.
The operation involved a cost of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the capital of the company, which could expand the next year to 15% remaining.
The objective of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a large international market.
This service is only addressed to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, location companies, garages, casses and professional sellers that must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was established in Germany in 1996 and has been performed by more than 650 000 operations throughout Europe, with 500 000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 soldiers and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3 000 advertisements per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed cannot be circled, but, on the other hand, some parts that are not covered can be used as rechange parts.
Collection cars can be reregistered, although they have been removed, after complex routes.
Garage duties in four stages
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user receives a duty in only four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the rechange room, create a duty and generate it.
The use facility is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince the older professionals that are reacted to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1 034 vehicles, including 666 tourists, 109 all-territories, 137 motes, 78 flightnets and 44 cars.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are needed.
Once the model to repair is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model concerned appears then the necessary part is selected.
The user may include variables such as the work hand price, majority or reduction, then it can print the duty to give it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an exhibition tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
The main difference between these two systems is that the garage destination does not include the estimated work time.
The use cost of this tool for the garage is EUR 350 per year, which can be subject to credit.
Today, the Audatex company works so that these images are in three sizes.
It is an innovation that mechanicals see very good eye, and it will allow, for example, to select a door and to turn it to see the internal face.
