How long are these symptoms present?
and all the pains in the breast cell should be treated in such a manner, especially in the light of your age
and with high temperature
and it is also necessary to check the levels of your colesterine and artificial pressure
And do you have high temperatures now?
And do you now experience this pain in a brain cell?
And if it is hard to breathe you.
And can you tell me what other symptoms you have instead of these?
And how high your temperature was
And I've got a cash.
And I've got a little slight with a box.
And I've really got a strong pain today in the breast cell.
and whether this is the time for the proof of the calamity which you are understood
And it's a pain in the breast cell.
And I think I've got a little high temperature.
And I want you to describe the place where the breast cell you experience pain.
and they also have a little higher temperature
And your diabetes history.
And do you know it feels like my breast will be disappointed?
And you know, people always smell on me.
And you're suffering in the skin cell.
And you said it's the pressure in the breast cell.
Some in the family have problems with heart, heart deal, micro-inflation, high level of colesterin, high arterial pressure
Is there any other symptoms or problems that you have noted and related to mouse pain?
Do you have other sicks at home with such symptoms?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Are you experiencing a shock now?
Are you still paining in a brown cell?
Because it's the grip season.
But we should not stay without attention because of the existence of a crude cell that has a cardiac nature
But now the more important problem is that pain in the breast cell.
But I've got a little breathing.
But I know that many people spend on me.
But we have to go to the treatment of any pain in the breast cell with the maximum seriousness.
But you're breathing well now, right?
'Cause I'm not remembering this pain in the summer cell.
It's like it's like somebody's sharping your crazy cell.
You're still feeling sweet.
Do they regret the symptoms of bad selfishness?
Do you have any other chronic diseases, such as high arterial pressure or something like that?
Do you have any other chronic diseases or medical problems, such as diabetes?
Do you experience this pain in a crude cell?
Do you have high artificial pressure?
Do you have this silence?
Do you know what the symptoms she had?
Do you see this image?
Get a lot of smooth tonight.
But I'm looking for the diabetes tests.
But she had symptoms in exactity as I have.
How high the temperature you have?
What artificial pressure do you have?
If you still have high temperatures
if you have the temperature of 30 and nine or above
If you think your symptoms or problems guarantee the improvement of the external type
I got the temperature yesterday.
I've got a little high temperature yesterday.
I had a temperature yesterday.
I'm experienced here in the breast cell of pain.
I'm also a little hard breathing.
I'll send you a picture.
I'm trying some pain tonight.
I've got a little bad head tonight and the temperature is up.
I think it's a grip.
I think it's a simple shape.
Does that remember that like a very hard man sit in your shirt?
all this began almost simultaneously with the main pain and the increase of temperature
I'm having a pain in the center of the breast.
It's like it's the pain in a sweet cell.
I've got it in the fire.
It's in the center of my breast cell.
It's in the center of the breast cell.
I've got a pain in the smell.
I'm very worried about this pain in the wound.
I want you to describe this pain in the smell.
as high arterial pressure or diabetes
As exactly in the center of the breast cell.
From high temperature you can now take a tissue in the form of ladys.
Now, Mary, tell me how many days you have shown these symptoms.
Now you said you feel pain in the smell.
From time to time, I feel a little pain in the wound
Well, if you're showing some other symptoms instead of pain.
Or is someone sit on your feet?
Similarly the same high temperature and cash, the main and muscle pain
Stress directly in the center of my breast
Show me this image where you feel pain.
Because you have high temperature.
So you think some of these symptoms could be related to pregnancy?
So your children have some of the same symptoms?
Tell me about your pain in the breast cell.
Temperature increases the night
The temperature that I had in the last two days
Temperatural began to increase last night
It's Dr. Porter in the quiet point of help.
All right, can you tell me a little more about your pain in the wound?
Well, I feel pain in the front of my body, here, in the wound.
Well, I'm feeling a strong pain in the smell.
So when I feel pain in the smell
What kind of thing do you feel in the smell?
When did you begin to feel that pain in the wound?
Where are you feeling pain in the grain?
Whereever you feel this pain in the grain?
You're experienced something like a murder in your sweet.
You know, I have a diabetes and that's all.
You said that you're experienced this pain in the breast cell.
Currently increased colonial infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and Britain in the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
Community infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in Europe/European Economic Zone and Britain, while confirming that, despite the various stages of its development in different countries, the Pandemic COVID-19 has severely increased in all countries.
In view of the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and offices, it is necessary to increase the level of preparation to the pressure of patients with COVID-19, which require treatment and, in particular, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, Mr. Huhahn of the Chinese province of Hubay was fixed in several cases of pneumonia of unknown ethiology.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Control and Prevention Centre reported that the infection reconstructor was a new type of coronavirus, currently known as the coronavirus of the second-third respirator syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since this time, SARS-CoV-2 disease was called coronaviral infection (COVID-19).
According to the data available today, about 80 per cent of COVID-19 people are easyly infections, i.e., in the form of respiratory ways with pneumonia or without it, most of the diseases are infected.
About 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases have been developed in a more serious form of hospitalization and in the other 6 per cent is critical if intensive therapy is required.
The mortality level of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is about 4 per cent.
This study is analyzed by the trends of commutative COVID-19 in each countries of the European Economic Area (ECE) and Britain and compared to trends in the Chinese province of Hubai.
We are also compared with the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/ECE and Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 diseases in the EU/ECE and in Britain
After the success in China, COVID-19 was distributed to other countries and currently in the rest of the world of COVID-19 is developed according to the same dynamic as China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Pandemic of COVID-19.
In the magazine number of Eurosurveillance, dated 5 March 2020, Mr. Spyter (Spiter) and his colleagues reported about the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, which responded to the criteria defined by WHO's existence of disease.
The three first confirmed cases in the EU/ECE were registered in France on 24 January 2020, and all three diseases returned from Mr. Huhah of the Chinese province of Hubay.
As at 15 March 2020, the cases of COVID-19 were identified in all 30 EU/ECE countries and in Britain, from 31 December 2019 to the date given, 39 768 cases of infection and 1 727 deaths, including 1 441 deaths, were fixed only to Italy.
Determination of culinary quantity and cumulative disorder
The European Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases (ECDC) is updated every day at 8:00 on the number of registered cases of COVID-19 in each world countries, such as the Ministry of Health, National and Regional Health and WHO.
The data are used to analyze COVID-19 trends in the EU/ECE and Britain and compare it with Italy.
As a level of dissemination of active cases of COVID-19 was estimated for 14 days, taking into account the normal COVID-19 in each EU/ECE and in Britain from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented a comprehensive number of cases contained in each country at 8:00 15, 2020, compared to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID19 in EU/ECE and Britain
Tendence to the development of the total cultureal disease of COVID-19 for the 14-day period in the EC/ECE countries and in Britain, the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (ris. 1).
Communitional COVID-19 in the EU/ECE and in Britain in general began to grow about 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 a rare scale of this indicator (complementary material).
This was mainly a huge growth in Italy's registered diseases, but also in all other EU/ECE countries and in Britain, similar trends have been observed to increase the cultureal disease of COVID-19 (complementary material).
2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/ECE countries and in Britain compared to Italy's similar indicator for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to that data, the general number of cases already registered at 8:00 15 of March in 15 other EU/ECE countries and Britain compared with the number fixed in Italy for about 3 weeks ago.
Our results demonstrate the rapid increase in the number of registered cases of COVID-19 in the EU/ECE and Britain.
CVID-19 observed trends make it possible to suggest that pandemics are developed with compared speed in all countries.
This is unlike different stages in different countries, with different reactions taken by national public health bodies, and, perhaps, different criteria for recognition of diseases and different rules for the selection of patients for analysis on the existing COVID-19, including the “insurance” testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors reported that nearly 10 per cent of the patients with COVID-19 needed intensive treatment, and IME noted that hospitals and hospitals have already been filled in these regions.
At the current time, data on the income of patients with COVID-19 in the hospital and (or) in the EU/ECE are available only for 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases (not submitted).
However, there is a systematic collection of such information to complement the current monitoring data of which is the number of registered cases and the number of deaths.
According to the outcome of the 2010-2011 study, Europe has observed a significant number of cocks in the intensive therapy offices and the hospital intensive offices: from 29.2 to 4.2 in Germany for 1000,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 cookies in intensive therapy offices and intensive income offices per 1000,000 people in 2010-2011).
In the sixth updated report of the ECDC on the results of COVID risk assessments, the modelling of health resource loading systems with evaluated COVID-19 in each EU/ECE countries and in Britain is more than 90 per cent of the risk of the missing cocks available in intensive therapy offices.
As at this time the case is grouped in certain regions of the EU/ECE and of the United Kingdom, hospitals and intensive therapy are generally providing the population of a certain territorial group, information on cases of identification and quantity of coke in intensive therapy offices is recommended to provide at the 2rd level of the Territory Nomenclature for Statistics (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the EU/ECE and the United Kingdom of COVID pandemics are deeply developed.
The countries, hospitals and the hospitals should therefore be prepared to the contact scenario of SARS-CoV-2 in deficiency for a long time, and to increase the number of patients needing in medical assistance and, in particular, intensive treatment, for example, in the suffering regions of Italy.
As reported in the last report of the ECDC on the results of the risk assessments, it is important to maintain the dissemination of SARS-COV-2 operative, preventing and integrated approach to the follow-up to minimum impact, since, taking into account the expected number of diseases in the decisions of persons and hospitals, it may not be enough to understand, adopt and correct their response measures if such measures are not before.
The report on the risk assessments also lists public health measures aimed at reducing the impact of pandemics.
There is only a small time in which they can intensify their control efforts in order to delay the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the loading to their health systems.
If not, the next days or weeks of health system in other EU/ECE countries are covered with the pressure of patients that will be required for intensive treatment.
The smuggling of the coronavir infection 2019 (COVID-19), raised by the coronavirus of a severe respirator syndrome (SARS) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was a tragedy for humanity: at this time, China and other world countries have ended more than 30,000 people, and the number of infected over 800,000.
Similar to the homological SARS-CoV virus that caused the development of a severe replicator syndrome in the 2003 year, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transferred from the flight museums and produces East Symptoms using the same mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is different from the less gravity of disease and lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more injured and affected by older people than youths and men more than women.
In response to the deep growth of new disease publications in this article, a current and comprehensive review of the rapidly developed research object is proposed.
We consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethiology, virusology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of this disease.
Although the answers to many questions are only to be found, we hope that this review helps us understand and eliminate dangerous diseases.
The pregnant (China New Year), who was on 25 January 2020, became an unprecedented and forgotten event for all Chinese people who were urged to remain home during the holiday and for many weeks after it.
In view of the high levels of similarity with the coronavir (COV), the slowness of a severe respirator syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) was called the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the co-conciliation disease 19 (COVID-19).
Epidemia began in the Chinese city of Uhana and quickly spread around the country and then almost 50 other countries of the world.
According to 2 March 2020, more than 80 000 cases of COVID-19 have been identified, and more than 400,000 patients have been rescued.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a “food number one for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.cmbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have occurred for more than two months, including article on his virus, epidemiology, ethiology, diagnosis, diagnosis and treatment, starting from the first report of 7 January 2020, which has been determined as a result of the virus issued from a number of patients.
This review constitutes an attempt to overcome the results of the research in the new and fast development of the object.
As we can try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavir, the coronavir of the Middle East Respirator Syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We also discuss the facts of prevention and prevention of diseases, as well as some of others, at the time.
The colonavirs were traditionally related to the number of pathogens that are not mortally dangerous for humans, and primarily caused about 15 per cent of general respirator diseases 4.
However, in this centuries we had two times faced high-patogenic human coronavirs, namely the coronavir of a severe respirator syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavir of the South-East Respirator syndrome (MERS-COV), which were marked by the disease in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 had been distributed accordingly and rapidly to many other States with a terrible level of disease and mortality.
As a result, the current COVID-19 is the third degree of coronavir infection in the history of humanity.
As indicated in Ris. 1.1, the report on classs of unknown origin was first conducted in the National Commission for Health of the CRC from Hut on 31 December 2019.
After seven days, the genetic follow-up of the virus was issued.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was registered in M. Whanya.
The epidemic was soon distributed in the neighbourhood of the city, the provinces and the country.
20 January, it was known about the infection of healthcare workers, which made it possible to transfer a virus from humans.
23 January, Mr. Whanya was introduced and stopped the work of urban public transport.
24 January, on the basis of the first clinical study of this disease, it was noted that 21 of 41 patients with the confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contacts with the market of marine products in M. Whanya, which was considered to be a direct point of dissemination of infections from unknown animal.
30 January, WHO declared that the abuse of the coronavir is a global emergency situation in the field of public health.
At the time of the preparation of this report, the disease has been distributed throughout China and has already occurred in about 50 other countries around the world (ris. 2).
In view of the intense development of the situation, the end-scale and the risks of the decline, it is still to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, the following updated epidemia development picture (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHP1QA) was presented by 8 866 patients, including 4 021 patients with confirmed COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 was supported by all age groups, but in the main case, people from 30 to 65 years of age were diseased.
About half (47.7 per cent) of infected were over 50 years, very few — about 20, and only 14 infirmed ones have not been performed for 10 years.
SARS-CoV-2 inhibited among men above (0.31/100 000), than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed by classs in the province of Hubay and nearby regions.
In the meantime, the symptoms of COVID-19 were 5 (2 to 9) days before the diagnosis was decided.
The incubation period was averagely 4.8 (3.0-7.2) day.
From the time of the symptoms before the death in the meantime, the day was 9.5 (4.8 to 13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95 per cent of CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the corrected R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
On 23 January 2020, an explanatory increase in the number of infected, assembled by the expansion of the Chinese New Year of transport.
Death among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1,44 per cent (95 per cent of CI: 1,10 to 1,86 per cent), and the adjusted mortality rate among patients is 3,06 per cent (95 per cent of CI: 2,02 to 4,59 per cent).
The third main factors of risk in the case of COVID-19 were: gender, age (≥60) and grave cases of pneumonia.
The colonavirs represent the subsequence of the major defensive viruses contained in a meaningful RNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta coronavirs are known.
In the case of the SARS and MERS glucoprotein glucoprotein glucoprotein (S) coronotencin receptors of the 2nd pharmaceutical type (ACE2) and dipipiptidazo-4 (DPP4) are connected to the cell receptors of the member symptoms.
The cytopolam is released by the gene of viral RNC; after the replication of viral genes, the CNN will generate viral maintenance vessels, which are then removed by the membrane cell.
The first reports of SARS-CoV-2 were held on 10 January 2020.
It is established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavir, which is 99.98 per cent corresponding to 10 subsequent images collected in the first age of disease, on the market of Huanung Sea in H.H.H.H.H...
Genetically SARS-CoV-2 closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2-electronic mikroscopie has been found in the ultra-tratton rows of human respiratory episode.
The ACE2 human farmer has been a SARS-CoV-2 receptive, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S-Protein SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2-human farmer than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less gravity disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate an unknown short-consumed white coded orf3b and a secreted white encoded orf8.
Orf3b virus bracky can play a certain role in the view of the virus pathogeneity and give IFN expression; but orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, the collection of authors in Chapter with Choo (Zhou) presented reports on the chronographic structure of the full-mentioned ACE2 farm with permission of 2.9 r in the composite of B0AT1 aminoxissul transport.
They found that the complex, in which open and close conformation was collected as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can connect two S-protectings, which serves by evidence when recognizing the coronavirus and infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic medication in the treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Inheritance and interim host
It is known that the source and SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV were a flight from which the virus has been transferred to humans through cylinders and herbs respectively.
Through the philogenetic comparation of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirs, it has been established that the first partners of SARS-CoV-2 are a museum because 96% new virus is identified as two similar to the SARS coronavirs, namely the coronavirs of SL-CoVZ45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown for what kind of kind has become a interim host whose virus has been able to overcome the spectacular barrier and to shoot the human; the way to transfer is still to find out.
Mr. Zzi (Ji) with colleagues suggested that the virus transferers from the flight to the human was a serpent in the process of geo-combination in S-Protein.
The results of their study of Chinese scientists from Guangchou suggested that pangolin is long-copylane, which often uses the traditional Chinese medicine, is the potential interim owners of SARS-CoV-2, which are based on a 99 per cent genetic dimension between panovirus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference between both genes is very large, so it is considered that the final results with specific evidence are not yet obtained (rise 33).
Physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2, most of them are still unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive for 48 hours in the medium and up to 5 days at temperature below 20 °C and 40 to 50% of power.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is feeling of ultraviolet and inclination up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; the effective blocking of the activeness of the virus may be efficiency, 75 per cent of theesthetic sphere, chloride deficiency, perus oxygen, chloroform and other growing manufacturers, but not clorgyxicin.
Human population generally does not have an immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are admissible to the new virus.
There are no data on detailed immune reactions to SARS-CoV-2.
So we can only refer to the early study of other coronavirs, first part of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (res. 4).
As a rule, the body of virus is first recognised by an immune system by means of the recognised images (ORD), including the P-type receptors, the Toll Toll Receptors, the NOD receptors and the RIG-I receptors.
Through different virus mechanisms, the expression of deterioration factors, dendric cells and interferonal symptoms of type I, which maintain the dissemination of virus and accelerate macropharmaceutical factors with regard to viral antigen.
However, through the N-Blee SARS-CoV, immune reaction may be avoided.
Soon in the fight against the virus, an adaptive immune reaction is included.
T-lymphocyts, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the protection of body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate generation of virus-specific anti-virus in B cells, and CD8+ T cells immediately kill infection viruses.
T-Helpers produce anti-apopulative cytokine that helps protective cells.
However, the coronavir may inhibit the T cell functions, causing them a programmated hybrid.
Guest immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, and antikörper, also plays an important role in combating viral infection.
For example, the anti-thermals chosen from the resolved patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system is the local education of a large number of free radio roots, which may be caused by a serious damage to light and other organs, and the worst scenario leads to polio-deficiency and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, whose classic proof is more likely to affect older people with co-conciliating pathologys and pregnant women.
The probability of infecting above is to those affected by a large number of viruses or have infringements in the immune system.
According to the results of the investigation of the first 425 cases of infection in Mr. Whahn, the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, the study of 1 099 cases showed that the incubation period in the average of 3 days was divided from 0 to 24 days.
The latter described above, based on the data of the demographic 8 866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) day.
It is very important to adjust the deadlines introduced in the case of incubation periods, which allows to prevent the dissemination of the virus of the infected topics, in which diseases are unlikely.
The general practice was a 14-day career for persons contacting virus or infiltred virus.
Should the cartinine be extended until 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 often is the high temperature that can be the only indication of other symptoms, such as soft cow, heavy breathing, muscle pain, heading, main pain, heavy pain in the mountain, poor, heavy pain, heavy, diarrey, toxine, and red.
Some patients have noted the skin and (or) hypothesis a week after the start of the disease.
In difficult cases, diseases have been rapidly progressed, and patients have developed the island of reservoir disease, septic shock, metabolic acid and coague.
Patients with high temperatures and (or) symptoms of respirator disease and hepatitis should be checked on virus in order to diagnose at first.
Demographic study, carried out at the end of December 2019, showed the following symptoms dissemination indicators: 98 per cent — high temperature, 76 per cent — sugar, 55 per cent — heavy and 3 per cent; 8 per cent of patients needed the art ventilation of light.
Similar results have been received in two recent cases of infection in the family and transfer of virus from unsympathized.
The compared results were received in 2012 during the study of MERS-CoV patients, with the main symptoms (98 per cent), the sugar (47 per cent) and the weight (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of them needed artificial ventilation, which is much higher than the patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher part of MRS ' s mortality than COVID-19.
A diarree (26 per cent) and a heavy pain was also observed in MRS patients.
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high temperatures (99-100%), sweet coal (29-75%), diarree (40-42%) and heat pain (13-25%) and light art ventilation requires 14-20 per cent of patients.
On February 14, COVID-19 was 2 per cent and the overall number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66.576.
In comparison with this SARS mortality rate to November 2002, 10 per cent of 8.096 cases were confirmed.
In the case of the demographic study carried out in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37 per cent of 2 494 cases confirmed.
According to the early study, the basic reproduction indicator (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was defined at the level 6,47 to 95 per cent of the reliable interval (CI) within 5,71 to 7,23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
The comparation of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV on symptoms, mortality level and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The higher capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to disseminate MRS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but mortality level in the case of the new virus below, compared to two lasts.
Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much harder than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV episode.
The clusters have often been infected within the borders of a family or group of persons who are assembled together for any reason or who have been assembled together in any transport, such as rail ray.
Patients often moved to M. Huhn or in other affected regions, lived there or contacted in the last two weeks before the start of the disease.
However, in the reports, people may be a virus portator without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and healed patients from the hospital may again become the portators of the virus, and this is an emergency signal to extend the time of the career.
At the early stage of patients, normal or decreased lecocytes (especially limbocytes) in Perifer blood were normal or reduced.
For example, 1 099 patients with COVID-19 have been placed limfopens with a 4x109/L level, including 1 x 109/L, as well as higher aspargain aminotrasphere and virus.
Some patients have found increased the levels of peen, muscle grains, and migoglobines in blood, and most patients observed the increased levels of C reactive wheat and the seat in blood.
Patients with heavy D-dimer levels have been increased, and the number of limfocides was constantly decreased.
The majority of patients with COVID-19 have been detected in rentgenographic breed cells, characterized by inequalities with both sides or inhibits in light.
Patients are often developed in typical pneumonia, injury to light and respirator disease.
In the development of non-controlled reparation, coping of iron and progressing fibrosis, the OHCH has a significant gas violation.
The disfunction of pneumonics type I and II decreases the levels of surface-active connections and increases surface length, thus decreasing and increased risks of light decline.
Thus, the worst results of rentgenographic studies often correspond to the most serious cases of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the elimination of pneumonites, the formulation of hygienical membranes and the interim limpocital infiltration, and the multi-year synchronization cells in lyric patients died from diseases correspond to the pathology of virus infection and ORSS and similarly found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As a primary criteria for COVID-19 diagnosing, the RNK SARS-CoV-2 was used through polymeric cep reaction with retrocryption (DCCs with rear transcriptase).
However, in view of the high levels of false notoric results, which can accelerate the epidemia development of 13 February 2020, China began to make a diagnosis based on clinical indications (which do not believe only in the GDP with the rear transcriptation).
Similar situation with SARS diagnosis.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to compare the data of the history of disease, clinical evidence, laboratory tests and results of rentgenographic studies.
Mr. Fenig Zhang (Feng Zhang) described the protocol of the application of the SERLOCK method, based on CRISPR to discover SARS-CoV-2; this method allows to identify synthetic fractions of RNK SARS-CoV-2, with a quality of 20 × 10 to 18 million/l to 200 × 10–18 million/l (10-100 cops of the origin micrometers) with the help of the identification fields that are not used in complex equipment.
This new method, if it is successfully checking on clinical prepatries, may significantly improve the sensitivity of tests and their welfare.
Because of the lack of anti-related anti-conscious coronavirus, the doctors may mainly provide to patients with COVID-19 only supporting therapy, while trying to use some therapeutic methods that were used or proposed in the treatment of other coronavirs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other virus diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antibodies, immune administers, steroids, plasmas of produced patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was proposed to use even the plasma of remedies for treatment.
The pharmaceutical companies aim to develop anticorps and vaccines to combat virus.
At the main stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks in the main light, and may, at least, affect other ACE2 bodies, for example, a heavy and heavy traction and shooting.
Nevertheless, violation of work and refusal of breast-feeding bodies is the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Therefore, to facilitate symptoms and life salvation, it is critically important to support respiratory functions, including general oxygen therapy, high concentration of oxygen, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive milk vent, which are depending on the deterioration of diseases.
Patients with heavy reservoir symptoms need support in the form of an extracorporal membranal oxygenation (ECMO), the modifyed blood selection method used for the treatment of the threat to the life of heart or respiratory inadequacy.
Furthermore, the main importance for patients with SARS-CoV-2 is to maintain water-solar balance, prevent and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of the functions of livingly important bodies.
It is known that cytokine storm is the consequence of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients identified by SARS and MERS virus.
The cytokine storm represents the form of a system deployment process developed in response to the cytokine series, including TNFAL, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFNAL, IFNō, IFN Gamma and MCP-1.
These cytokines lead to immunocytes to a large number of free radio cuts, which are the main cause of UNO development and polio-deficiency.
In the treatment of quotine storm, especially in patients in a serious state, the importance of immunity is important.
For the treatment of cytokine storm, corticosteroides and tocilysums were used, monoculent anti-terms who serve as an interlayin-6 inhibitor.
The number of other methods of cytokine treatment based on immune advertising include immuno reaction modules aimed at controlling T cells; IFN- Gamma, IL-1 and TNF cytokine processing; cytokine advertising; cytocyclopaeting, cytocyclopetric owners 4 and hystodetalastic inhibitors.
In order to reduce the degree of breast-feeding processes, SRS viruses are widely used as immunity administers.
However, steroids are not useful when treating heavy damages in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they may cause serious adverse effects, especially avashal osteonics, which significantly deteriorate prognosis.
However, short corticosteroid rates are recommended in small and medium-scale care when treatment with patients with COVID-19 are critical.
At the time of the preparation of the document, there is no confirmation of effective anti-virus therapy.
However, the internal remdeciver, a nucleoid analysis, was effectively treated by the American patient from COVID-19.
Remdesivir is recently developed by the anti-virus, originally developed by Gilead company for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and the Marburgian virus.
Later, the redistributor also demonstrated the possibility of other viruses with single-centured RNAs, including MERS and SARS virus.
In response to these data, the Gilead company provided data to the Chinese drug composite for a couple of studies on patients identified by SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are not tolerated.
Furthermore, balicitinib, α-interferon, lopenar/ritonavir and fishery were proposed as possible therapy options for patients with close respirator symptoms.
Combined treatment with the use of stronavir/ritonavir may be associated with diarrees, tosnotes, routines, phenomenon and other disorders.
It should be careful to monitor the interaction of these preparations with other medicines designated to patients.
Plasm of resolved patients and anticorps processing
Blood clothing in patients with current disease is very long used for other patients suffering from the same disease or for healthy population.
Indeed, there is a relatively high number of anticorps in the blood of recovered patients.
The antiquity is in immunoglobuline designed by B-lymphocytes to combat pathogènes and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and are directly neutralized.
On the basis of this preference, the blood plasma was set out of the group of patients treated from COVID-19, which then induced 10 weight of the patients.
During 24 hours the symptoms of their symptoms have increased, reduced the acid and virus load, and increased oxygen saturation.
However, to propose a massive application of this method before the specific therapy, it is required until the check and non-disciplinary explanations are carried out.
Furthermore, the therapeutic effect should be aware of some deficiencies related to the application of the plasma.
For example, antikörpers may be excessively encouraged to the immune system and cause the symptoms of cytokine emissions that, in view of toxicity, are potentially threatened to life.
The concentration of anticorps in blood is normally insufficient, and the plasma for the treatment of patients in critical states requires much.
It is not easy to develop and make special antibodys enough to combat global epidemic.
Thus, more important and practically, to determine the B-cells of healthy patients and to determine the genetic code of effective anticorps or scratch to find effective anticorps against critically important virus wheels.
So we can move to the mass production of anticorps immediately.
Chineses used traditional medicines to treat different diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends significantly on the combination of many form components, which is different from the diagnosis of disease based on Chinese traditional medical theories.
Most effective components are still unknown or have an indefinite action because they are difficult to identify and check these components or their optimal combination.
Currently due to the lack of effective special therapy of COVID-19, the traditional physician has become one of the main alternative methods for the treatment of patients with easy and medium-sized symptoms or for patients that are injured after the heavy stage of disease.
For example, capsules Shu Feng Jie Du (Shu Feng Jie Du) and Len Hua Zin Wain (Lian Hua Qing Wen) were effectively recognized in the treatment of COVID-19.
The largest part of the patients with COVID-19 was observed in several provinces in which the Chinese traditional medicine was used in treatment with 87 per cent of patients including Ghanese (63,7 per cent), Ninicio (50 per cent) and Hungary (50 per cent), while in the Province of Hubeia, where the Chinese traditional medicine was used only to treat about 30 per cent of the COVID-19 patients, was fixed as the lower (13 per cent).
However, this is sufficiently strict comparison, since the evaluation should be carried out in account of the number of other factors of impact, such as the number of patients and their illnesses.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boly Jhan (Booli Zhang) and his colleagues published research materials in which the treatment was performed exclusively on the methods of Western Medicine and the combinated treatment of Western Medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the length of normalization of the body temperature, the elimination of symptoms and medical assistance in the station was less than in patients who used the combination of the methodology of Western and Chinese traditional medicine, whether in patients with only western methods.
It is more surprised that the percentage of patients who began to deteriorate symptoms (of a easy state of heavyness) was noted below in the group which had been treated through the combination of the Western and Chinese traditional medical methodology than in the group only treated by western methods (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent) and the mortality level in the first group was lower than in the second group (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
However, the effectiveness and security of the Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely controlled studies in more and more regions.
The specific interest also represents the possibility of describing the action mechanism and explaining the aspects of the effectiveness of components used in the Chinese traditional medicine methods or their combinations.
Patients suspected or reaffirmed the existing COVID-19 are primarily experienced a strong fear of absorption and even death diseases, and people closed on the carrantin also experience a smoke, unity and more degradation.
Furthermore, infection symptoms such as leakage, hypothesis, and cash, as well as malicious treatments, such as corticosteroids, may cause even more anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages, the illness caused by SARS was reported about a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depressions, increased concerns, illness, psychototic symptoms, divisions, and even sozial conduct.
The binding monitoring of contacts and cardinees in the number of measures undertaken by health bodies for COVID-19 may increase the concern and feeling of guilty related to the dissemination of infections, carrants and social climate in their families and friends.
Consequently, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspected and contacted with them, as well as all the other persons that it requires.
Psychiatological support should be formed by multiple profiles of psychiatric assistance, to provide clear information with regular and accurate updates of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics and treatment plans, and to use professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contacts.
Effective vaccine plays an important role for the interruption of the infected animals and infected persons to admissitive guests and are often used in addition to antiboviral therapy used for the retaining of episodes caused by new viruses.
Vacuum was made based on S-Protein, which is intended to develop long-term and high-active neutralization anti-related and (or) protected immunity to SARS-CoV.
In animal studies, lively weak vaccines from SARS virus have been developed.
However, before the start of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these possible vaccine in natural conditions should be identified in their use in older patients, the model of the mortal forests and the protection of zoovirals.
Perhaps the fact that SARS's virus was lost 17 years ago, and there was no new case.
At the same time, consequent cases and classs of diseases caused by MERS, which are born in the Middle East and distributed in other regions by maintaining zone sources in the arcades of endemics.
For combating MRS, vaccination strategies were developed with the use of inactivated virus, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, novels, viral components and recombinant skin elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunity persons is an urgent and critical task that requires a decision to maintain the epidemia.
There are, however, severe difficulties for the delay (in the midst of 18 months) to develop vaccine, and the dynamic vision of coronavirs.
As previously unknown diseases, COVID-19 only begins to show a full picture of the clinical disease by thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients have been slowly rescued without complications.
However, COVID-19, similarly SARS and MERS, also relates to the high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with heavy disease.
In this regard, health bodies are critically important to form a prognosis model in order to determine the priority of their measures, especially in areas in which the lack of resources is observed.
Based on the current clinical studies, the following factors may affect the prognosis of the disease in patients with COVID-19 or are related to them (Table 33):
Augmentation: age was the most important factor in prognosing HIV virus, which also corresponds to the truth in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 is mainly affected by patients from 30 to 65 years, 47.7 per cent of whose 50 years old, according to the above study of 8 866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive therapy were more likely to have source diseases and complications, and they were significantly higher than patients who were not required (in average 66 years against 51), which indicates that age is a pregnant factor for patients with COVI-19.
Pol: SARS-CoV-2 infiltration among men above than among women (0.31/100 000 against 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Disorder and complication: in patients with COVID-19, which are required to intensive treatment, above the possibility of degree of microarm damage and aritmia.
Cardiological manifestations were also the principal cause of the death of patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be linked with ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which could cause a violation of the breast work in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and original diseases are closely linked and can result.
Delays identified in the laboratory studies: the level of the blood reactive bleeding reflects the heavyness of the skin or damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential pregnostic factor for depression of disease, therapy reactions and final recovery.
It was also proposed to take into account the interrelation between the P-reactive white level, the degree of disease and the COVID-prognosis.
Furthermore, the results can also increase the level of lactodehydrogenasis, asparagin-aminotranfesis, alanin-aminotranphesis and creatininasis.
These farms are distributed by different bodies, especially by hearts and breasts, and their emissions are affected by the skin.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart-sharing or pending disfunction.
The main clinical symptoms: to predict results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, the data of the raw cell and the development of the clinical symptoms should be taken into account for other factors.
The use of steroids: as already described above, steroids are immunity advertising that are widely used in infectional diseases as an additional therapy to reduce the deterioration of the deterioration process.
Since corticosteroides were widely used for patients with heavy forms, many of the survivors have developed avassial osteonics that resulted in live disability and low quality of life.
Thus, in the case of the use of steroids for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, these preparations should be designated in small surveys and short courses.
Psychological stress: As already described above, many patients suffer unexpectedly strong stress because they are often to survive long periods of care, to deal with high uncertainty and to observe the death of their parents and other patients.
To eliminate stress in such patients and help them to return to normal life, psychological consultations must be conducted and long-term supported.
According to the demographic research at this time, COVID-19 epidemia seems to be different from SARS epidemia.
In addition to replication in lower respiratory ways, SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other coronavirs that cause common abuse diseases, can successfully grow in high respiratory ways and cause weak symptoms or have no symptoms at the early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients in which the first stage of disease or not yet ended in the incubation period may, by means of their ordinary life, distribute virus in significant scales, which significantly cause epidemia control.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV virus was considered when patients were ill, in most cases in the early stage of infection.
Thus, today's COVID epidemia is a larger SARS epidemia, and it is harder to control.
Currently, in China, a great work has been announced by Mr. Uhahn and neighbouring cities, as well as the career regime has been extended by almost all the people to stop the scope of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Although these measures have a great damage to the economy and other areas of the country, the number of new patients identified is reduced, as it says about the slowing levels of epidemic dissemination.
The illness has been completed by the optimistic estimates at March, and the infection phase is 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hutter (Paul Hunter) with colleagues stated that the COVID-19 smuggling, which seems to be much higher than SARS, would not be ended in 2020.
Researchers from the group called Irra Longini (Ira Longini) have made a model to predict episode end and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 virus could be struck to two thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian Specialists Group reported that SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in massacres of noise and horses taken in patients that were recovered and decreased from the hospital two weeks ago, as indicated that new virus could become cyclic diseases similarly.
However, the reduction of the new cases in China is insufficient, indicating that the current strategy could have been effective.
According to the original prognosis, Ebola was to shoot up to millions of people and to be caused by polylion of patients.
But by a strict cartinine and exclusion of diseases at the end of the end, it could be controlled.
There is a probability that, like SARS-CoV virus, the infecting capacity of SARS-CoV-2 virus can be decreased, and for a while it disappears or turns into a less pathogical virus associated with humans.
The following is compared with COVID-19 epidemies with SARS and MERS (ris. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high speed of transmission through a cash or a defect, as well as by direct contact with the polluted virus.
The virus was also discovered in the box, which means that it is also possible to transmission orally-fectively.
According to one of the last studies, 41 per cent of the 138 studies may have been the result of hospital infections, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 nurses.
Consequently, serious precautions should be taken to protect the people, particularly health workers, social employees, their parents, colleagues and even bilateral, contacting with patients or infected.
The first line of defence against the risk of infection is a mask for persons; and the surgical masks and the N95 (Serial No. 1860s) replicators are helping to control the dissemination of viruses.
Surgical masks do not give microcaps to potentially infected smoking in the air and to sit on the surfaces with which they can be transferred to the surrounders.
However, only the N95 levels (Series No. 1860s) can protect from the respiration of virus from 10 to 80 mm, they have only 5 per cent of virus; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same as SARS-CoV-2, and they are both large as 85 nm.
As parts may even pass up to five surgical mass together, medical workers directly contacted with patients must take the N95 (series No. 1860s), not surgical masks.
Besides the mass, medical employees should be able to put fire on the figure of the protected gallet to further reduce contact with viruses.
Virus can also fall in body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor slaughtered SARS-CoV-2, despite the shock of the N95 class; the virus may have been in his body.
The medical employees should therefore also have a transparent slipper or protected closure of the type.
All populations in the suffering or potentially substantive threats of the regions are urged to switch the hands of their disabled means, try not to get out of the house, respecting self-resolution, and to limit contacts with potentially infected people.
The admissible distance to the patient is considered a distance around a metro.
These measures reduce the risk of infection and prevent the dissemination of virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known, the high level of humanity is similar to SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, should be a alarmed signal for China, taking into account the experience received during the SARS in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Headquarter of the Disease Centre in M. Huhan has supported the citizens, reporting that the new virus has a low contagious and limited reproductiveness when transmission of humans to humans and that prevention of dissemination and control of diseases is not a problem.
This statement was significantly reduced the social tension, especially during the period in which the country was prepared to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and was critically critical when diseases could be held in the borders of Mr. Huhahn with minimum losses.
The Chinese health organizations can renew this serious lesson and in the future make significant improvements.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more attention to the public statements since each word takes into account the citizens and may affect their relationship and decisions; (2) monitor and react more closely on the non-disciplinary information carried out from the clinic, and not expect official reports from the doctors and officials; (3) to take more decisive measures to maintain the potential epidemies at the previous stages of its development, but not to enhance publicity; and (4) to enhance the institutional and effective teachings to enhance the information of the population of epidemic diseases and the regular improvement of the system of reaction.
COVID-19, previously identified by an unexpected coronavirus of a severe respirator syndrome of second type (SARS-CoV-2), began at the end of December 2019.
At least two months of disease, the whole China has been covered and the document was distributed in 50 countries in the world.
Because virus is very similar to the coronavir of a heavy respirator syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms of a heavy respirator syndrome (SARS), with the COVID-19 reactions.
However, between COVID-19 and SARS, there are significant differences that are significant to epidemia and patients ' s treatment.
COVID-19 affects older people more than youths, and men in higher levels than women; the percentage of serious cases and mortality among older people is also higher than among youths.
Deadability in the result of SARS above than in the case of COVID-19,91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
The virus of COVID-19 patients is distributed even with unsymptoms of disease, while HIV patients and SARS generally affect the environment only in serious cases of diseases, so that the distribution of COVID-19 is more difficult than SARS.
This is partly explaining why SARS-CoV-2 is much faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have a negative common switch on the existence of SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, patients treated can redistribute positive virus tests.
All of this increases the risk of dissemination of virus.
In such a rapid movement of COVID-19 research, some important issues have remained unsolved, i.e.:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of 96 per cent of the SARS-CoV-2-related SARS coronavirs, we cannot still say that SARS-CoV-2 was identified from the flight museum.
What kind of animal was the interim species transmitting the virus from the original heritage, such as the flight mouse, to the man?
No answers to the first and second questions, we cannot be able to stop the path of transfer, and epidemiological circumstances can at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical trials demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 was linked to ACE2, but how is the virus involved in diet cells and the following pathological changes?
Is the virus also related to the manufacturer of ACE2 cells in other bodies?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure the rapid and accurate determination of diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long is epidemia?
How is genetically evolution in the process of transmission of humans to humans?
Is he a cause of world pandemic, will he also disappear as SARS or will it periodically reciprocate such a grip?
These aspects have an important importance, but to search for answers to these and many other questions, it requires time.
However, we don't have any other choice except to stop epidemia as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zonic origin of human coronavirs
Mutuation and adjustment have stimulated the coevolution of coronavirs (CoV) and their portraits, including the people, over the millenniums.
Before 2003, two human coronavirs (HCV) were known to make easy diseases, such as normally simplicity.
The succeeding of a heavy respirator syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respirator syndrome (MERS) has changed our view of how catastrophic and dangerous human coronavirus could be infiltrated.
The demonstration of the coronavirus of the second severe reservoir syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in Central China at the end of 2019 reiterates the coronavirs and surprised the high transmission of the virus, but less expressed by this virus as compared with the SARS-CoV virus.
The coronaviral infection of humans represents a zone, and the understanding of its zone origin will be very useful.
Most human coronavirs originate from the flight museums for which they are not pathogeneous.
It is also known by the interim mediators of some human coronavirs.
Determination of animals directly affects prevention of human diseases.
A study of the interactions of coronavirus animals can also be lighted on the pathogenesis of coronavirus in people.
In this review, we provide existing data on the seven human coronavirus, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as their zone origin and ways of intervision.
It is important to note that we have a comparation and a comparison of different human coronavirs with regard to viral evolution and genetic recombination.
This is also considered by the current epidemic of the disease raised by the coronavirus found in 2019 (COVID-19).
Moreover, it is noted that the conditions necessary for the successful change of the media and the impact of the virus on the heavyness of disease are made.
Coronavirus relates to the family of Coronaviridae, which represents a group of defensive viruses with one positively polar RNC new.
These viruses with the most largest part of the GNC-containing virus, which consists of 26 to 32.000 nucleotics, have been called through their form, which reminds the colon when considering electronic microscope.
In view of the structure, the coronavirs contained non-sectified genes with an identical organization.
About two thirds of the gene contained two large partly open-converted counting frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the protection of the pp1a and pp1ab platforms.
These proteins are further transformed to generate 16 non-structured sheets marked by NSP1~16.
The last part of the genome contains the open counting frameworks for structured whites, including the switch (S), the switch (E), the membrane white (M) and the nucleoprotein (N).
In other lines of coronavirus, there are also a number of line-specific acessor whites encoding.
Based on the differences in the white sides\ coronavirs are divided into four types (alpha, beta, hamma and delta coronavirus), the beta coronavirs includes most human coronavirs and shares four lines (A, B, C and D).
There are philosogenetic evidence that the majority of alpha and beta coronavirs are the museums and grises, while birds are the main reserve for gamma and delta coronavirs.
Thousands of coronavirs continued to overcome intervision barriers, and some of them were evolving to the dangerous humans of pathogens.
To this day, seven human coronavirus are known.
The human alphacoronavir HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63.
The last five betacoronavirs include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, the coronavirus of the severe respirator syndrome (SARS-CoV), the coronavirus of the southern Eastern Respirator Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and the coronavirus of the second SARS-CoV-2 respirator syndrome.
Human coronavirus HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 are generally calling symptoms of easy shape, such as simplicity and (or) diar.
Unlike them, SARS-CoV viruses, MERS-CoV and recently discovered SARS-CoV-2-Patogenics, severely infection diseases of lower diet in comparison with the number of patients with the higher possibility of development of the close respirator disease (ORS) and the detection of unlike symptoms.
The first ring of the human coronavirus HCOV-229E, B814, was obtained from the sample of disabled patients in the 1960s.
Since then, comprehensive studies have been collected more detailed knowledge of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 viruses that cause local infection symptoms.
Indeed, there was a general concept of acceptance, which has been considered a human coronavir in generally harmful.
SARS was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history in 2003; over 80,000 people had suffered, and the overall mortality rate was about 10 per cent.
Decades later, the syndrome of the Middle East (MERS) has led to a long epidemic in the Arab semi-orienter, and the disease has been distributed in the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCOV), which was then transferred to SARS-CoV-2, is the rebuilding of the current episode of the coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), which led to more than 3 120 lives on 3 March 2020, and the number of 910,000 infects.
The security signal is received, and the peace must be prepared to the dominant SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronavirs have zone origin, their sources are a flight mouse, museum or home animals.
Many data collections have shown in the benefit of the evolutional nature of all human coronavirs from the flight museums, with which viruses have been well adapted and which are not pathogical, but demonstrated a wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 episode left China and all the world a serious call for medical, scientific, social and moral views.
A study of the zone mechanism of human colonial origin allows to understand their natural history that moves to their evolution and factors that limit intervisional transactions.
It may also raise or accelerate the search for a reserve, a interim and implicit SARS-CoV-2 portator, which is very important to prevent re-distribution of disease in the future.
This review contains general information on the origin, intervisional transmission and the pathogenesis of human coronavirs.
In particular, we are marking and considering the following general feature: the original viruses from human coronavirs are generally not pathogenic for their reserve portraits, but have a patogical nature after the intervision of the new mediator.
We also analyze the trend of human coronavirus evolution, according to which transmission is often associated with the deficiency of pathogical properties.
The same context is considered by the outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 support.
The colony of animals has been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before HCOV-229E has been obtained in the first sample of the skin of patients infected by skin, different coronavirs were in different infected animals, including indexes, muscles, cows, sweats, sweats, cooks and dogs.
The past decades have been identified by seven human coronavirs.
Table 1 provides a short history of the discovery of human coronavirs in chronological terms.
The first stage of HCOV-229E has been obtained from tests taken from patients with the infectation of higher respiratory routes in 1966; the virus was further adjusted to the increase in the light cells of WI-38.
Patients, identified by HCOV-229E virus, showed sweet symptoms, including the main pain, injury, general impairment and pain, while high temperatures and cash were observed by 10 to 20 percent of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCOV-OC43 virus was chosen from the organic culture and the sequence of a series of museum passes in the brain.
Clinical signs of HCOV-OC43 infection are similar to the infection of the virus of HCOV-229E, which are not excluded from the impact of other pathogenes of diet, such as glup type A and ritovirus.
And HCOV-229E virus, and HCOV-OC43 virus have global distribution in the world and normally are transmitted to dead wide ranges.
The main incubation period of these two viruses is less than weeks and the disease should take place for about two weeks.
According to the results of voluntary research, healthy people in the virus of HCOV-229E have developed a common simple shape.
Only few patients with weak immunity showed a serious infection of lower respiratory ways.
SARS, also known as “typical pneumonia,” became the first for the whole history of humanity a well-documented pandemia identified by the human coronavir, and the manufacturer of the disease was the virus of SARS-CoV, a third of the identified human coronavirs.
The first case of SARS disease was identified at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guandon.
During the SARS epidemic, 8 096 cases of disease were documented and 774 deaths were distributed in many countries and various continents.
Unlike superactive distributors, each diseaser was able to cut nearly two other persons; the incubative period was 4 to 7 days, and the skin of the viral load was at the 10th end of the disease.
Patients identified SARS-CoV have marked pain in muscles, main pains, high temperatures, general deficiency and awareness, and among the more later symptoms were counted skin, shock and respiratory insufficiency.
Distributed laboratory indicators from standards with SARS are limfopens, pestilences and higher cretinity levels.
Patients with SARS also observe diffused allergic damage, epidemic cell proliferation and increased macrophage levels.
About 20 to 30 per cent of patients are required in intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In such difficult cases, more than low-scale ways may also be identified by other organs, including heavy-sized track, pending and skin, which is generally associated with cytokine shore, which can be placed annually, especially for patients with weak immunity.
The first virus was elected from the open biopsy of the sick parent who came to Hong Kong from Guango.
Since then, huge efforts were aimed at studying human coronavirs.
At the end of 2004, HCOV-NL63 was elected in a 7-month child from the Netherlands.
First, it was established that it was mainly affected by children of older age, older people and patients with weak immunity and respiratory diseases.
For HCOV-NL63 disorders, such as nickel, conjunctit, high temperature and bronchiolite.
Another independent study describes the selection of the same virus from a natural material taken in the 8-month boy of the Netherlands who suffered from the pneumonia.
Virus was found in the Netherlands, but in fact it is totally distributed.
According to the report, HCOV-NL63 is a cause of nearly 4,7 per cent of largely distributed reservoir diseases, and the skin that caused them is the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 are connected to a constructive laring, which also calls a crop.
HCOV-HKU1 was elected in Hong Kong in the same year by a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pounds and bronchiol.
In addition to the nervous pneumonia and bronchiolite, HCOV-HKU1 are connected to aesthetic disease.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 virus, which causes respirator diseases, have been identified throughout the world.
All of these four human coronavirs, which caused infections, were well adapted to people and their mutations, which were infected by high-pathogical diseases, generally poor, although the incidents were and their causes were not known, as a rather example of HCOV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, caused serious infections in the lower diet roads in China.
Normally, obtaining the effective ability to transfer and maintain human body, these human coronavirs are less vulnerable or pathogeneous.
The Coronavirus of the Middle East Respirator syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first chosen in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the light of 60-year-old patient with the beach-in-law and sexual inadequacy.
Most laboratoryly confirmed cases had been placed in the Middle East, but in different European countries and Tunisia, passenger cases and dissemination were registered through epidemic second cases of invasion in close contacts.
Another second report from 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical symptoms of the south-East Respirator syndrome (MERS) remind the symptoms of a severe respirator syndrome (SARS) for both infections are a progressive deterioration of pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also deteriorated insufficient injury that MRS is still different from the other diseases caused by coronavirs to human transmissions.
More than 30 per cent of patients have been observed with iron-case symptoms, such as diarea and routine.
At 14 February 2020, more than 2.500 labs confirmed in the Middle East Respirator syndrome with high mortality levels (34.4%) were registered as one of the most known mortal viruses.
During the midst until the end of December 2019, Mr. Huhah of the Chinese Province of Hubay were identified by patients with pneumonia, which now, regarded by the past, linked to the infection caused by the coronavirus of a severe respirator type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization announced that the continuing infection of lower respiratory ways called SARS-CoV-2 was a global emergency situation in the field of public health, and the disease itself was called “CoVID 19” (COVI-19).
At 3 March 2020, 90 053 cases have been registered in the world, with about 3,4 per cent of death.
It should be noted that mortality in the Chinese province of Jubai is 4,2 per cent and under its limits is 1,2 per cent.
SARS-CoV-2, such as SARS and MERS coronavirs, causes a heavy respirator infection characterized by increased temperature, cash and heat.
Some patients also observe diarrees.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and is able to quickly move into the syndrome of respiratory inadequacy.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, taking into account the high geophysics of nucleoid sequences (82%), these viruses, however, are different winds of philosogenic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 apparently is less pathogical but has more ability to transfer with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The cases of unsymmetric SARS-CoV-2 infiltration are registered, which demonstrates the ability of this virus to divide rapidly throughout the world.
As a result of the comparation and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other six human coronavirs, important substances and differences are demonstrated.
First, coronavirs have similar incubation periods and the duration of their diseases.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the remaining six human coronavirs.
Second, COVID-19 symptoms are between SARS-CoV and four human coronavirs caused infections (e.g. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections are similar that are mostly observed in the infection of human coronavirs that cause infections involuntary, including nonspecific, light symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as in the SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of COVID-19 cases can be set, although there is a little lower proportion.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is also noted in interesting legislatives, characterized for human coronavirs that cause infections, as well as for SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is, as at least, the same high as in human coronavirs that cause infections.
On the other hand, it is still to verify whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced with each successive transition of the virus (i.e. by the identification of each next person), such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as well as other human coronavirs caused infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the figures of cala.
We still need to answer whether the actual-oriented transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is the same significant (also in some circumstances), as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Special interest is also a question of the possible period of SARS-CoV-2, characterized for human coronavirs caused infections.
However, the continued development of COVID-19 will depend on the features of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenicness and sustainable dissemination.
All four human coronavirs that caused infections with easy form symptoms were well adapted to people.
On the other hand, they may have been well adapted to these four human coronavires.
Other words, and those and others could be called the only slightest after the pandemics of human coronavirs in the past.
Human coronavirs that cause severe diseases and human coronavirs have only not survived.
In order to do so, human coronavirs must be replacing in the human body sufficiently so as to recover adaptive mutations that oppose density factors.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 is further extended and more people will be infected, so that virus is fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop through the career or other activities of control of infectional diseases.
For many years, the population circle four outbreaking coronavirs that make a common circle in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require animal reserve.
High-coated coronavirs SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt enoughly to people, and their transmission could not be supported.
They must be kept and multiplied in their zone reserves and search for cases of injury in human fabrics, perhaps through one or more interim or heavy portraits.
SARS-CoV-2 has some kinds such as SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and four outdoor HCOV viruses.
It is quite easy to be delivered as emergency HCOVs, at least now.
But he's more pathogenic than involuntary HCOV, and less patogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is still seeing whether he is fully adapted to the human and whether it will circle in the human environment without a reserve or a interim animal mediator.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCV virus, we will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, interim, stimulating and reserving viruses.
Life-evolutional noise of HCOV, if it brings closer preconceiving with the same high-level homology with nucleotics.
Previous virus is generally adjusted and non-pathogeneous in the portable.
Similarly, the reserve portator continues to have HCOV for a long time.
In both cases, the nuts are naturally infected and are natural HCOV or their parent virus.
Unlike that, if HCOV was only put into a interim portrait directly or around the time when he was brought to man, he was not well adjusted to the new media and often patogenic.
This interim mediator can serve as a zone source of human infection and play the role of the eliminating median, allowing the virus to be replicated, and then moved people to increase the infection of people.
HCOV may be transferred to the tube infection if it is not possible to keep the transmission inside a interim portrait.
Instead, HCOV viruses can also be adapted to the interim mediator and even to establish long-term edenity.
In that case, a interim driver is a natural reserve loader.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the SARS patient had an anonymous contact with pleasant animals (children).
For further security studies, the traffickers showed that the anti-IgG anti-filtre to the SARS-CoV virus was higher than the population in general.
Gimalian cylinders (Paguma larvata) and an anotovical dog on the markets of living animals have become the first established virus portators such as and almost identical SARS-CoVs.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all civilians on the market, SARS cases have no longer been reported.
At the same time, SARS-CoV did not determine, in most cases, that it would make the conclusion that gimalian citizens could only serve as a interim mediator, not a natural SARS-CoV reserve.
It is noted that, since 80 per cent of the different animals on the Guangchou market have antikörpers to SARS-CoV, it is impossible to exclude the possibility that interim pollutants can also serve a number of smaller types of muscles.
All of them say stupid SARS-CoV virus.
The following search for a natural SARS-CoV portrait has identified a close-general CoV flight museum called a typical coronavir of HKU3 subcontaminated aircraft museum (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and presented in Chinese sub-commerce flight museums.
The museums are positive to SARS-CoV and the genetic SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and the other coronavirs of the flight muscles are 88 to 92 per cent the same homology as the SARS-CoV.
These studies have set the basis of a new concept that the flight museum was a porteur of new human pathogens.
The flight mouse also identified a number of SARS-profit coronavirs (SL-CoV), but none of them, except one of the WIV1, could not be excluded as a living virus.
It is known that the SARS-CoV receptor is a human angiotensin-converting farmment 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, obtained from the delay of a flight museum, uses ACE2 age museums, citruss and humans as a receptor for income to cells.
Awesome, the reverse of SARS adverse patients could neutralize WIV1.
Today WIV1 is the most closest parent of SARS-CoV in the flight museum, dividing 95 per cent of the nucleoid hypothesis.
Despite the high geology between these two viruss, WIV1 is generally not a direct parent virus SARS-CoV, and the flight museum is not an immediate reserve of SARS-CoV.
The philosogenetic analysis relates to the same group as CoV-HKU4 years of age museums, and CoV-HKU5-year museums.
CoV-HKU4-year mouse and MERS-CoV are using the same mediator, the dipiptipidazo-4 (DPP4) to detect viruses.
Consequently, the depending RNK-RN-Polymers of MERS-CoV virus is closer to the follow-up of the beta coronavirs of the flight muscles identified in Europe and Africa.
There was no living MERS-CoV virus in the wild flight museums yet.
The nucleoid sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest parent of CoV-HK25 are only 87 per cent.
The flight mouse couldn't be an immediate reserve of MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, research on the Middle East showed that the smuggling snacks are seropostitive to neutralizing anti-télés, special for MERS-CoV, as well as the snakes of the south-East in many African countries.
Life MERS-CoV, the identical virus detected in people, has been removed from the native skins of single snakes, which further reaffirms the role of the slaughter as the real reserve portators of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that the skins, experimentally infected with MERS-CoVs, have observed low symptoms, but the massive virus deployment.
It is not only that the infected viral has produced virus in a respirator, but also a physical and oral way, which is also the principal way to select a virus in the flight mouse.
However, there are still questions, since many confirmed cases of the Middle East Respirator syndrome did not have an anonymous contact with the symptoms before the emergence of symptoms, and they are rightly related to the transmission of humans or the transfer of unknown channels, including uninstalled animal species, which are MERS-CoV porteurs.
SARS-CoV-2 logology corresponds to the 96.2% of the RTG 13-year museums set out in the Asian subcontinent Rhinolophus afnis.
Like in the cases SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, diversity between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to include their parents' relationships.
That is, the flight mouse could and not be an immediate reserve recorder of SARS-CoV-2 only if there are no identical coronavirs in the future.
Proposedly, direct animal mediators of SARS-CoV-2 should be among wild species that are sold and died on the oil market of marine products, which had been associated with many main cases of COVID-19, which indicates that the possible case of transfer of animals is possible.
A few recent studies based on the metabolism sequence concluded that a group under threat to the destruction of small muscles known as pangone (Manis javanica) could also be transferred to the parent betacoronavir, the parent image of SARS-CoV-2.
The geophysics of these new genes of pangonic coronavir 85-92 per cent corresponds to SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13, with an identity at the nucleoid level by about 90 per cent.
They are classified in two substances of virus differencies such as SARS-CoV-2, in philosogenetic trees, one of which is closer to SARS-CoV-2, with the identity of the minexics at the level 97.4%.
Instead, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more differentious, despite the higher geology in all genus.
In the early study of sick pangolines, the definition of viral constitutes was also reported in light tests that were similarly parent with SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of collection and manual processing were used to obtain genes, including about 86.3 per cent of the full-scale viral genes.
It is not possible to exclude the possibility that pangoline becomes one of the interim SARS-CoV-2 animals.
However, due to the diversity of comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronavirus by pangoline-CoV-2, there is no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangoline.
Furthermore, a distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is still shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronavirus with Pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in flights, pangolines and other mushrooms is not yet installed.
While the highest hypology was found in the SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus of Pangoline-CoV-2 family SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RTG13 were the most high genocide homology.
Very theoretically, high levels of similarity between Betacoronavirus, Pangolina's family SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 are related to parallel evolution through electricity.
The anti-protectional proposal is a recombination between the betacoronavirus of pangolina, the family SARS-CoV-2, and RTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the movement force of evolution, the recombination is widely distributed among beta coronavirs.
The final decision on the direct zone origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still not.
In addition to high-pathological HCOV viruses, HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HU1 are also studied.
Philogenetic evidence shows that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E can occur from the flight coronavirs, while the parent viruss of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 are discovered in grums.
It was reported that the coronavirus of the flight museum called ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and identified in the North American Trinity Success, demonstrates close birth with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E has been genetically linked to another coronavirus, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that his interim mediator could also be sweepers.
In order to clearly clarify the modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronavirus are entitled to figure 1 and table 2.
The philosogenetic analysis provided evidence of HCOV intervisional transmission in anamnesia.
When the intervisional transmission of HCOV-OC43 and the people from home animals occurred in about 1890, pandemia of respireator infection was registered.
The history of the intervisional transmission HCOV-229E is not so clear.
The alphacoronavirus of flights, close-coated HCOV-229E were found.
The alphacoronavirus is among them.
Some data support the direct transmission of the virus from the flight museum.
First, people, not alphabets, could contact aircraft mouses in general environmental lows.
At the same time, people are closely contacted with the alphabets.
Second, the alphacoronavirus of the flight muscles HCOV-229E, in flight museums, varied and non-patogenic, while the alphacoronavirus of the alphabic reservoir in the infected animals.
Finally, alphacoronavirus was not found in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be excluded by the possibility that the alphacoronavir, the parent HCOV-229E, has received from people.
In fact, the flight museum is the direct source of human pathogical viruses, including bees, Ebola virus, Nipah’s virus and Hendra virus.
So it is unexpected that the flight mouse could directly transmit HCOV-229E people.
On the other hand, while the alphacoronavirus of the flight muscles could serve a giant tube of HCOV-229E, the alphabics and the cylinders could be the interim mediators transmitting people's virus, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of intervisious transfer from the flight museum to the swimming museum and the one-bodies to man.
Evolutional origin of MERS-CoV virus from the flight museum known as its original identification and then confirmed the follow-up studies.
It is obvious that the flight mouse gives a rich pole of virus diversity for intervisious exchange of genes and intervisional transmissions.
Thousands of years, inhabited colonies, close social interaction and ability to fly with the "ideal distributors" museums.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV virus was introduced to unilateral observances for decades ago.
He was well adapted to these observations that were converted from a interim porter to a stabil and natural reserve portor.
The MERS-CoV virus has a very easy disease and is characterized by relatively low frequency mutations.
His episode transfer to a person is an accident, and the human remains a stupid MERS-CoV, since its transferer is not supported.
Unlike the role of the helmets in transmission of MERS-CoV, pangolines, if there is, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In particular, the beta coronavirus of pangolines is high-pathogeneous in pangolines.
They may be sweet betacoronavirs, parent of SARS-CoV-2, as well as cylinders in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, we must confirm or eliminate several intervisional transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals.
First, the mouse flight may be a reserve-measurer for the virus parent of SARS-CoV-2, almost identical SARS-CoV-2.
People can share the environmental weight with aircraft mouses by smoking or cutting the tissue of these animals.
Secondly, pangolines may be one of the interim pollutants in which the parent SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been discovered.
People are infected by the virus by the part of the tuss and the use of the food of wild animals.
A lot of animals, including homes, may be SARS-CoV-2.
The investigation of domestic and wild animals on anticorps is correct.
Third, as indicated above, a recommendation and adjustment of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in the third way that had contacted both with flights and pangolines.
Search for animal origin is continued.
In addition to various types of animals, three main factors of virus have also contributed to the transition of intervisional barriers.
They are mainly relatively high-speed mutations in replication of CRC.
Compared to other infected viruses, the calculated frequency of coronavir mutations may be considered as the average replacement rate of 10 to 4 per year, depending on the adaptation of the coronavirus to the new guests.
Coronavirs have an adjusting extraction of imboneclass, which causes the elimination of extremely high frequency of mutation and deficiency or even incapacity.
It is interested that the nucleoid analysis of Remdesirvir provides replication of coronavirs through the inhibition of this extraction of imboneclass and the independent RNK polymers.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising means against SARS-CoV-2, which should be checked during clinical studies.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times above their portraits.
Furthermore, mutation frequency may often be above if coronavirs are inadequately adapted to the portator.
In comparison with SARS-CoV with high-frequencies of mutation, SARS-CoV-2 mutations are seen below, which shows the higher adaptation to people.
The virus is already adjusted to another mediator close to the human.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also related to MERS-CoV, well adapted to unicorbatic observations.
Theoretically notable that vaccines and anti-virus antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 quickly lose efficiency as a result of genetic ray.
Secondly, the great gene of RNA in coronavirs has increased plasticity in the genetic modulation of mutations and recombination, thus increased the possibility of intervisional coevolution that will be used to create new coronavirs in the existence of relevant conditions.
This contributes to a number of unique accounting frameworks and functions encoded in the direction of the 3e end of the gene.
Third, through the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronavirs in case and often changing matrix during replication of CRC.
During the transcription of the DNA of coronavirus in the nuts that serves by a smooth mixture, it is often the changing of nitrogen.
High-economic and sub-general NNCs can recover and create new coronavirs.
The philosogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, both in animal coronavirs, such as SL-COV and the bag COV-HK9.
Virus interaction with the reporter on transmission
In addition to the three above-mentioned virus factors, another key factor for intervisional transmission is the interaction of the virus with the mediator.
This article as a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection in the events of intervision, is a recommendation of SARS-CoV.
Based on a comparative analysis between human-coV images and cyclings, SARS-CoV is considered to have a rapid adaptation to different portators, especially with regard to mutations in white S.
In general, the S coronavirus white RSD is in combination with the cell receptor, and the anti-coroner response is intensely chosen.
SARS-CoV is the 318th-five-first of the S1, which is linked to the angiotensin transforming farmment 2 (APF2), as well as its coreceptors.
SARS-CoV virus is enabled to identify ACF2 different animals, including a flight museum, cybers, museum and anotovical dogs, making possible intervision of the virus.
In fact, only 6 minocyclotic remains were found different from human and cive viruses, with 4 in the linked receptive for association with APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoVs have mutations of K479N and S487T in the RDC, which can increase the interaction of the skin wheel with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two minosules can be particularly important to adapt the virus to the person.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same liquid receptor as SARS-CoV.
Difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 white-S segments makes it possible to change the linking S white asylum to human APF2.
Indeed, a study using a chromost microscop says that the affinity of this connection is 10-20 times above between ACP2 and SARS-CoV virus.
It would also be interested to determine whether any other coreceptors are required to transfer SARS-CoV-2.
It is surprising that HCOV-NL63 is also linked to ACF2, but other S.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as HCOV-229E and 9-O-acetyl oxygen for HCOV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronavirs to people after intervisional transfer from animals.
In addition to cell receptors, the intervisional HCOV transmission results are also managed by other factors of dependance and the limitation of the portor.
The diversification of these portraits between humans and natural reserve portraits, such as a flight museum, a swimming swimming and grises, may be a barrier for intervisional transfer.
In order to successfully transmission of HCV viruss, the dependence factors should be confused and the results of the restructuring of the portraits.
In this regard, molecular determinators in this important area of interactions between virus and noise are still needed in definition and category.
Good results can provide an impartial full-general scope of dependence and restructuring of portraits for SARS-CoV-2 through the new CRISPR technology.
New HCOV reset: back to the zero mark
The diversity of flight-mouse coronavirs makes wide opportunities for new HCV.
In this sense, the coronavirs of the flight museum serve the genetic pillar for HCOV.
Furthermore, the intense mutation and genetic recombination are also the movement of Evolution of HCV and serve two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes that codify whites has the ability to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessions are important to adapt people to ORF8, as the SARS-CoV parent viruses were isolated, but they were established that they coded ORF8 divergent whites.
The 29-nucleoid delegation was found in the stams isolated at the beginning of human epidemie, characterized for SARS-CoV coronavirs.
The delegation deploys ORF8 to ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered a adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of the portors.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has the history of possible recombinations with the lines of alpha and gamma coronavirs, where the CNC-Dependant RNK polymer has been defined in a large number of smaller recombinatory parts.
Recombination was also defined in non-structural squads nsp9, most nsp10 and nsp14 parts.
Similarly, the epidemic MERS-CoV events were recombining between different lines, which occurred in the unrelated observances of Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinative events were also observed in other HCVs, where HCOV was recommendated with other animal coronavirs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that the artistic selection can contribute to indefinite changes in viral genes, which may actually result in the elimination of virus from selective pressures, such as the part of the immune mediator system.
The example of such effects is the loss of full ORF4 in the prototypical HCOV-229E, through a double-classified delegation.
While an intact open ORF4 counting can be observed in the flight and detection viruses of the parent HCOV-229E, the alphacoronavirus of the alpine demonstrates a single-classed insertion that leads to the improvement of the frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCV is also the pressure of selecting their reserve portraits.
In the infection of the flight museum, the symptoms or their absence were registered by the coronavirus, which is said about mutual adjustment between the coronavirus and the flight museums.
It was said that the flight museum was channelly and physically adapted to coronavirs.
For example, the deficiency of the active response in the flight museum reduces effectively the pathology caused by coronavirs.
Furthermore, the natural activity of the aviation cell killer in the flight has been led by advertising the NKG2/CD94 natural killer receptor and the low expression of the main cyclus of class I.
Furthermore, high levels of active oxygen, which provides high metallic activity in the flight mouse, may result in replication of the coronavirus, at the same time on the account of the extra-boneclease, thus creating the selection of the virus stamps that are high-pathogeneous when the new mediator is launched.
More pathogens of coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new wheels or white properties for the adaptation of the portor.
Thus, it was not unexpected that in the last twenty-years three new human coronavirus occurred.
Coronavirs are not pathogenic or have light symptoms in their reserve portators, such as a flight or a bleeding museum.
They are certainly replacing, not due to a strong immune response to the portator.
This is a secret why we see unsymmetric portraits and that causes serious cases of human infection.
The extreme symptoms are mainly related to the hyperactiveness of immune reaction and cytokine shock, which is more stronger than the immune reaction, so seriously light.
Instead, the immune reaction is not compared with the replication of the coronavir.
Similarly, the strategies of immuno reaction may have favourable effects on therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
In the flight museum, the interferon is particularly strong.
Thus, the interferon type I should at least have a favourable effect in the primary phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Furthermore, the NLRP3-inflammose actives in the flight mouse.
Based on this inhibition, NLRP3-inflammose using MCC950 may be useful with COVID-19 treatment.
SARS-CoV-2 recovery should be a general scheme with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While betacoronavirus has been found, the nucleoid homology with 95 per cent corresponds to SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of the flight museum, a nucleoid homology that corresponds to 96 per cent of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there has been found that cyber and other animals have translated viruses, identical SARS-CoVs have not been installed directly interim posts for SARS-CoV-2.
Betacoronavirus, relatively homological SARS-CoV-2, has been found to betacoronavirus, which says that pangolines could serve one of the interim portraits or that the fragments of the beta coronavirs can enter the final version of the SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining issues, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intended or created by a person.
The coloniavirs focused on themselves because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 sums.
Research of coronavirs in flight museums and other animals has radically changed the importance of zone origin and HCOV animals in human transmission.
Available evidence showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were originated from the flight mouse and were transferred to man through interim portraits.
If the SARS-CoV infection is from the contact between people and cycling on the market, the closure of the child markets and the destruction of the cycling could have been effectively put the end of SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of different lines of betacoronavirus of pangolines, closely-generated SARS-CoV-2, pangolines should be removed.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 persons are transmitted to pangolines and other multicopyers and how this may be possible to remain the tasks of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has been in single snakes for a long time.
They serve as an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and skin for local populations.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to provide all assurances for the control of MERS, as done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the distribution of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the periodic success of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccine against MERS-CoV in combination with other infected control measures.
As we can't remove these viruses, new genotypes can be caused by diseases.
In the world circle a variety of zone coronavires.
In particular, the coronavirs of the flight museum are extremely different.
There is a large number of opportunities for evolution and recombination of these zone coronavirs that will bring new coronaviruses that are easily transferred and (or) more mortal for humans.
In order to reduce the number of contacts between people and animals, it should be rejected from the culture of use in wild animals in some areas of China.
After urging tests, which have become SARS, MERS and COVID-19, the best preparation and plan of response to such situations is needed.
In fact, many viruses existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until there is no opportunity to enter the new territory.
Although many of the flight museums are proud to disseminate viruses when people learn to keep them away, they can minimize the possibility of contacting humans with flight mouses and other species of wild animals.
In order to better understand the environment of coronavirs and their natural portraits, the permanent epidemic oversight of minors is needed to prevent coronavirus from animals and future diseases.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent virus zonoos is to keep people beyond the environmental weaknesses of zoovirus.
In the head of the SARS-CoV-2, there are still few fractions.
First, if the flights have transmised the previous SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolines, it is interesting to see the situations in which the mouse and pangoline share the same environmental low.
Second, if the flight plays a more direct role in the transfer of man, it is necessary to determine how people have been connected with flight mouses.
Third, if the role of the true interim mediator plays a third multicopy, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different types, including people who fly and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including home animals, may be admissible to SARS-CoV-2, epidemiological supervision and experimental intelligence should be carried out.
If so, the flight, pangoline or another muscle, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its previous viruses will be defined in their natural mediators.
Further studies in this field are lighting on the evolutional path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have significant consequences for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in people.
The diagnostic criteria for “insurance suspicion” and ‘proof cases’ of COVID-19 must be updated.
On 6 February 2020, our group has published a short dealing guideline on diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-N-COV), which provides information on our experiences and are given correct recommendations to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronavir infection (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of the current results of research and clinical experience; the diagnostic strategy and the therapeutic practice have also been updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and introduce new diagnostic criteria for the “insurance suspicion” and “provided cases” in accordance with the document “The Recommendation for Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19” (Seventh Version) issued by the National Committee on Health.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCOV), receiving the official name of the coronavir 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus illness was called “a severe respirator syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as pandemia.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group has developed a short dealing guide and published it at the Internet website of Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This publication was a great attention to herself.
Let us note that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of the current results of research and clinical experience, so the diagnostic strategy and the therapeutic practice have also been updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, the National Committee on Health (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) issued seven publications of the “Therapy and diagnosis recommendation for COVID-19” issued by the National Committee on Health (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), which contained significantly some of its provisions.
Recently, in the work prepared by Choo (Zhou) with the counterparts, comments were made on our recommendations, with simple proposals on diagnosis based on clinical experiences.
This work was added to our recommendations of new practical witnesses, as well as to provide valuable information on this pandemic covering the world.
We reaffirm their work and express our appreciation.
However, according to the last issue of COVID diagnosis and therapy (true seventh version) and the results of the current research, and their work is needed to update.
In accordance with the seventh issue of the document (of 3 March 2020, p.), to conduct a comprehensive analysis when confirming the case of suspecting of disease, one element of the epidemiological history with two clinical statements of disease must be combined:
Epidemiological history: (1) migration or location history in Mr. Whahn and its neighbourhoods, or in other posts of population; (3) contact history with patients with high temperatures or spectator symptoms from G. Uhanya and his restaurants or other villages, where the diseases of COV were registered during the last 14 days before the age of 14 days.
Clinical detections: (1) high temperatures and/or brake symptoms; (2) external detections of COVID-19; (3) the general number of licocytes is normal or lowly lymphocytes at the early stage of the symptoms.
The diagnosis for a confirmed case of disease should be based on the case of suspicion with a patogentic or serial evidence of one of the following points, i.e.: (1) PRC tests in real time are positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-generation of virus shows high hypothesis regarding new coronavirs; (3) positive results of serbotic for SARS-CoV-2 anti-technology for SARS-IgM and IG; or change of the results of a positive incidence for the special RS-CoV-2-IG anti-G, or not at a rate of 4-year grade.
It can also be noted that in the second January (18, 2020 g.) and the third (22 January 2020) test of the document was added in real time for nuclein cyclings in the daily ways or tests of blood.
The pathogenic diagnosis of blood loss was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) exhibition; and then the need for a series of evidence was added in the seventh issue.
These changes are based on the results of the non-proliferated work of researchers employed by a positive optimistic set for the detection of nuclein cycling in rapid diagnosis, as well as for analysis of the daily ways of tests, including the selection of blood tests, which enhance the accessibility of different types and enables to include positive test results for special anti-thermal tests in the confirmation criteria.
However, there are more evidence regarding the need to demonstrate care when treating patients with typical symptoms and patients without expressed symptoms.
Consequently, the route map presented in the work of Chow (Zhou) and Dr. should be updated since the persons without clinical symptoms are classified as a group of low risks.
The evaluation system also requires specification in further clinical practices and research.
We conclude that we hope to receive more direct evidence and call for readers to leave their comments.
As regards the diagnosis of “insurance suspicion” and “provided cases”, we propose readers to follow and strictly implement the last recommendations given in countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports about five new death cases resulting from COVID-19 — day maximum
Bangladesh confirmed five new death cases on the result of COVID-19 per day.
This is the largest number of deaths from virus per day.
During the last day, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Diseases reported that in the number of registered cases of infirmation, there were 114 cases, as well as 33 injuries in the home.
Overall, 17 deaths were registered.
In the online-brifing, director of the IEDCR Dr. Midrabi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman were victims.
According to Dr. Mirdjaby, two of the age of 60, two of the age of 51 to 60, and one of the age of 41 to 50.
She also reported that two dead were from Ducky.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic of COVID-19.
Clinic staff reported the local Anadu news agency that was Jadaal Simon Rahman, director of the Bengal Corruption Commission, who had been treated in the Cuban Clinic Meitri.
On Saturday, in the Online Visa Declaration, the Minister for Transport and Bangladesh Obidul Kwader stated that the work of the public transport would be stopped for more long than was planned until the next Saturday.
The public transport work was stopped from 26 March and should be re-established at Saturday, 4 April.
Transport of goods of the first need — medicines, fuel and food products — has still been authorized.
The first cases of COVID-19 were registered in Bangladesh on 8 March by two persons returning from Italy and one of them.
At 19 March, these three people have already been rescued.
SARS-CoV-2 has overlooked the millions of cases of infection throughout the world
According to the University of Johns Hopkins, the overall number of cases of coronavir infection of SARS-CoV-2 was over one million over all over the world.
From the COVID-19 colony, at least 52.000 people died.
The same day as the first case of infiltration was confirmed in Malawi, and in Zambia was the first case of death from the coronavirus.
The North Korea stated that it was one of the few countries in which the infection of the coronavir infection was not fixed.
During the last day, the World Health Organization reported about 1 051 635 cases confirmed infringements, including 79 332 cases for twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. for the central and European time (0800 UTC) 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases were registered by the infringement of coronavirus, at least 5 900 years.
CBS News, with reference to the University of Johns Hopkins, reported that more than 1000 deaths were fixed in the United States environment.
The countries worldwide have announced that measures to prevent dissemination of disease were resolved.
On Thursday, Mr. Moskova Sergey Sweden extended the self-isolation of the citizens of the city until 1 May.
The previous President, Vladimir Putin, said that Russians throughout the country, despite self-resolution, would receive payment until 30 April.
Portugal's Parliament voted for 15 days for the prorogation of an emergency situation; the results of the vote were: 215 votes, 10 abstentions, and one “anxious” vote.
Saudi Arabia extended the comandant hour in the sacred towns of Mek and Meit on the full day, while the preceding time was only 3 hours to 6 morning.
Thai planned to introduce a comandant hour from 10 to 4 a.m.
The Governor of the State of Ogayo, Mike Duyne, declared that the rule of home self-isolation in the State territory was extended by order until 1 May.
The purchase in Australia limits the number of toilet packs that will be obtained for one time
On Saturday and Saturday night, Australian shops for Woolworths and Coles have decreased the number of toilet paper packages which can be acquired once in all shops of the country, to two and one package respectively.
The ALDI also set limits to one package in the lunch.
These restrictions were reported in cassets, as well as on the Facebook website.
As reported, citizens began to make extreme reserves because of the insurance that COVID-19 could affect the introduction of a general self-isolation regime.
The Woolworths network also limited the number of shopping toilet papers to one packet.
Previously, 4 and 5 March, Woolworths and Coles have already limited this number of 4 packages.
The Coles’ network in its press relicense of 8 March reported that, with the limitation of four packs, “the many shops of tuberculous papers still were still too fast, one delivery during the hour,” and called the question “bessistent”, while ALDI was published on Tuesday at the Facebook end, called this tendency “inexpected”.
According to the representative of Woolworths, in the past week a rare growth of sales was observed.
The Costco Magazine in Canberre was also limited by the number of two packages last week.
In order to fill the deficit, Coles was ordered to provide more parties and increase the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional parties while ALDI had made stocks for special early sales in the medium.
Russel Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Rileye Association, reported that ritualists are trying to fill the stocks, but it is difficult for the limitations of local authorities in terms of the schedule of shipping cars.
It is expected to increase the productivity, since the suppliers are trying to satisfy the request, but there are still less benefitous proposals.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some shops could not be able to conduct environmentally.
The News.com.au report reported by Dr. Gary Mortimer, a technological expert from the University of Quinnishland, reported that the shops were completed every night.
He noted that the toilet paper is a sound product, so the number of containers is small and the whole number of goods remains empty, increased by lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the legs could be filled, and the goods such as the roofs of tube papers and the deficiency funds for hand could be placed on these fields in large numbers, buyers probably wouldn’t have been so packed, ” says Russell Zimmerman.
Recently, the manufacturer of a residual tube paper Who Gives a Crap reported the end of the stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the toilet producer of Kleenex and Solaris Paper, which also produced Sorbent markets, reported that they work roundly to ensure enough number of goods.
Domain.com, the sales site for non-motiveness reported that when the number of purchasers in Melbourne was decreased because of the lack of buyers on the weekly day of work, some soldiers began to propose a free toilet paper for the first party.
The fourth daily publication of NT News, which was printed in Darwin, included a page of eight pages designed to solve and use as a toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australien report of 3 March, the shop was unfortunately imposed the number of goods purchased by claiming that they did not plan to do so.
Russel Zimmerman adds that other products are also used by higher demand, including medical masks that defined hands, galleries, hands and muscles.
Similarly, more than the events in Australia, on Sunday night, it was noted that the online magazine of the British Supermarket Oka also limited the sale of the toilet paper André’s two packs on 12 rules.
The World Health Organization announces the pandemic of COVID-19
In the midst of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic of COVID-19-infectional disease inherited by SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the term “pandemia”, only the levels of disease and not the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that the Governments must take measures:
“All country has not yet been able to affect pandemic development.”
This may be when countries will be identified, tested, treatment, excluding the disease, monitoring cases of disease, and mobilization of their citizens,” explained the Director-General of the WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan Gabrosus.
"We are deeply concerned at the level of dissemination and seriousness of disease and defect levels."
According to Dr. Tom Friden, former Director of the United States Control and Prevention Centre, this pandemia is a “precedent”.
He said in his interview, translating CNN in February, that "no other respirator virus other than grip has not been monitored from the time of his occurrence to an unexpected global dissemination".
Mr. Geberusus expressed the same view, said that “we have never observed pandemics that were called by coronavirus.
We have never seen pandemia that can be controlled."
First, in January, WHO announced that the emergency situation in the field of public health had international importance and then introduced a new status of pandemic.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergey and Infectional Disease, Dr. Antonio Fauchi, said, “This is just starting, it will be worse.”
At least 126.000 cases of COVID-19 cases have been registered by the Association Press on Thursday Worldwide, and over 4 600 people have ended.
The pandemic of Coronavir 2019 to 2020 gg. is the moment of the pandemic of the coronavir 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavir of a severe respirator syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The sum was identified in Uhana, China, in December 2019, and 30 January 2020, the emergency situation of international public health importance, which was then recognized by Pandemia on 11 March 2020.
At 10 April 2020, some 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 were registered in 210 countries and regions, resulting in the death of about 97,000 people.
About 364.000 people were rescued.
China ' s mortality level is 4 per cent, while 13.04 per cent worldwide in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The worst general symptoms include heavyness, cash, and difficult breathing.
Possible complications relate to pneumonia and a delicate syndrome of syndrome.
The first symptoms of disease are usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific treatment currently found.
The basic treatment is symptoms and supporting; the recommended preventive measures include the brain, the closure of the rats, the compliance of the distances between humans, the identification and self-isolation of people suspecting their identification.
The authorities have reacted to the situation by inducing travel restrictions, carriage measures, commanding time, risk controls at workplaces and the closure of different objects.
Pandemia has led to a serious global social and economic impact, transfer or elimination of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as to a wide disappearing deficiencies of goods affected by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, which has affected about 99.4 per cent of the world's students.
The Internet began to distribute information on virus, the cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and South Asia, or those who remembrance them outside, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of dissemination of virus are observed.
As a result of reducing the number of trains and the closure of the severe industry, air pollution and carbon emissions were reduced.
On 31 December 2019, the Uhan City Health Organization (Foundland of Hubei), China, reported on the event of pneumonia with unknown causes, and the situation was started at the beginning of January 2020.
Infringements were mainly linked to the optical market of Huanni Sea producers, so virus, as they believe, has zone origin.
The virus that has been injured by the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2, which has recently been opened with a large part of the coronavirs, pangonic coronavirs and SARS-CoV, and later found that the first case of disease occurred on December 1th, 2019, and that the market was not visited after that date.
Two thirds of the infringements registered in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, in the publication of the South China Office, Morning Post, which was not checked, it was suggested that the first case of infringement was the 55-year-old resident of the Province of Jupiter on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that the number of new cases of infringements in China was decreased but was unexpectedly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases of infringement in China first exceededed the number of new cases of infringement in China itself.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly decreased, in particular because of low-expressed symptoms.
On February 26, a relatively few cases of infringement among youths, with the patients whose 19 and the age are less than 2,4 per cent of the world; the Chief Scientific Council of the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallans, stated that 60 per cent of the British population will be informed until the preparation of an effective immunity group in the country.
Statistics include cases of infringement of people checked on COVID-19 and which test was positive in accordance with official protocols.
On 23 March, no country has been able to check more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, has been adopted an official policy that prescribed not to test only by low symptoms.
The survey published on March 16, showed that, until 23 January, 86 per cent of the cases of COVID-19 were not found, and that such unregistered sicks became a source of invasion for 79 per cent of registered cases.
Statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of real invasion in Italy was significantly exceeding the number of registered cases.
The initial evaluation of the basic reproductive number of infections (R0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
In the study published by the United States Control and Prevention Centre, the indicator may be 5,7.
Most of the patients with COVID-19 are well-being.
In other cases, the time from the start of the symptoms to the death was 6 to 41 days, the most private period of 14 days.
At 10 April 2020, about 97.000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
China, on 5 February, some 80 per cent of death cases had been over 60 years, and 75 per cent of the victims died had co-conciliated diseases, including heart-sociocial diseases and diabetes. Official data on death from COVID-19 include reports of the deaths of patients with positive results of COVID testing carried out in accordance with official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be higher, since official numbers may not take account of the dead people who have not been tested — for example, in the case of their homes, in the homes of older, etc.
Incomplete information on Italy shows that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded official COVID indicators 4 to 5 times.
The secretary of the United States Control and Prevention Centres (CDC) recognizes: “We know that [notified number of dead] below the fact,” his words are confirmed by the reports of some single cases in the United States. The similar account of incomplete data is often met in pandemics such as the sweet grip H1N1 2009. The first remarked death was registered in Uhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death of China was registered in the Philippines on February 1 and in the borders of Asia, France, on 14 February.
On 28 February, more than ten deaths were registered in China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions in all continents, except Antarctics, have been reported about the death cases.
All indicators are different from the region and the dissemination of diseases; they also affect the number of tests, the quality of health systems used in the treatment scheme, from the start of the disease and the population's people ' s success, such as age, gender and general health status.
According to the statistical data of the University of Johns Hopkins, the global number of deaths and infringement cases is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204).
Data is different in different regions.
In China, mortality rates reduced from 17.3 per cent (for whose symptoms occurred from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those who had occurred after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of mortality rates resulting from disease (CFR) -- percentage of diagnosed patients who died from diseases, and the percentage of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (disaggregated, and non-disaggregated).
These statistics are not attached to a specific time and reflect the population indicators since the infringement of the disease has been completed.
Some scientists tried to investigate these indicators on specific groups.
According to the estimates of the evidence medical centre of the University of Oxford, the mortality level of this pandemia in general is 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The top of this diameter is agreed with the outcomes of the first arbitrary COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as with the statistical research analyzing the impact of the CFR evaluation.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The pyck and accuracy duration of the switch are not defined and may be different from the location.
Macey Boni, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, states that “not-controlled infections are generally expenditure, and then, when the number of available nurses are finished, they are starting to abuse.
However, in the present situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prognosis about when this happens."
The Old Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, June Nanshan, claims that “all can end in June” if all countries are able to mobilize and implement the recommendations of WHO for the end of the dissemination of virus.
On March 17, Adam Kuchersky from London's Hygiene School and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 “is circleable for a year or two.”
According to the investigation carried out by the Imperial College Nila Ferguson, “together until the vaccine is established (possibly 18 months or more) is required to comply with the physical distance and other measures.
William Shaffner, Vanderbilt University, believes: “I don’t think that this coronavirus will ever be dismissed because it is so easy to be transferred, ” and that he “is able to become a seasonal disease that has been suffering every year”.
The ability of new success will depend on the collective immunity and the level of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively unspecified, and some infected persons may be able to overcome disease without symptoms.
Two most distributed symptoms are higher temperatures (88 per cent) and sugar cables (68 per cent).
A few broadly distributed symptoms include heavyness, education of microcarbons in diet roads (almost), loss of depression, breath, pain in museums and substances, pain in the hills, main pain, skin, skin, blood carcase, dialysis or cyanosis. WHO states that it is seriously diseased with the development of respiratory problems of almost every six-person.
U.S. Control and Prevention Centres (CDC) contain unfortunate symptoms such as respiratory disorders, permanent pains or feelings of illness, immediate consciousness, difficulties with the trial and smelling of persons or smells. In the use of these symptoms, further disease development can lead to a degree of consciousness, a skilled diploma, sepsi, sectism, and death.
Some infected persons may be insight without any clinical evidence, but the results of analysis confirm the facts of the infringement, so the doctors recommend to place persons who are closely contacted with patients with whom the diagnosis is confirmed, under strict control and investigate for the purpose of infiltration.
According to China's scientists' number of cases of insynthm disease is covered from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The general incubation period (time between the impression and the appearance of symptoms) is collected from one to 14 days; normally it is five days, and there is no fully clearness for the loss of the detection: for initial COVID-19 rates, in which the symptom was developed, was 30% and was up to 15%.
Some details on how dissemination of disease are still unknown.
The disease is mainly transferred during the close contact, as well as through small caps that are covered in the air together with castle, smoking or conversation; closely contacts are underlined in radio from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
A number of studies in the open box can be distributed at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 m (27 feet).
There are preferences that the virus may also be transferred through small cables chosen during the conversation, which can remain in the air over a longer period, and the respirators can also be trained at the outlet, including during the conversation, although the virus is not normally transferred to air.
The smells can pass into the mouth or the smells of those who are close to the people, as well as in light.
Some medical procedures, such as intimulation and heart-ly-life reaction (LLL), may lead to the distribution of extraction products and, therefore, to disseminate the virus in the air.
He may also be in the body if a person relates to the contaminant surface, including the skin that is following its eyes, feet or skin.
There are also fears that virus can be transferred through fecality, but the risk of transmission is considered low.
The Government of China rejects the possibility of physically-oriented transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is the first three days after the symptoms of symptoms, although it may occur both before the symptoms and later stages of disease.
There were cases when the tests were positive in three days before the symptoms were tested, and that is the possibility of transfering virus to the expression of symptoms.
There are only several reports on laboratoryly confirmed cases of illness, but in some countries, there were also cases of transmission of diseases from unsymmetric portraits.
The European Centre for Prevention and Diseases (ECDC) workers say that until it is clear that virus is easier, however, knows that one patient usually has 2 to 3 other persons; the virus can survive from a few hours to a few days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylen) and on the nervous (304) virus have been able to live up to three days, on the surface of a day, and on the medium surfaces up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary in depending on the ability and temperature, and a positive result of COVID-19 was received in homes and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transfer the virus to people, although the British authorities recommend hands after contact with the animals, exactly as after contacting other surfaces to which infected persons could be attacked.
The extreme respirator syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus found in the first three persons with a pneumonia from the group with the extreme respirator diseases registered in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the nature of the family coronavirs, and the virus can be destroyed by means of a good milk that develops its protected shelter. SARS-CoV-2 has a great link with the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is supposed to have a zone origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavir showed that it is genetically classified with Betacoronvirus, a parent of Sarbecovirus (monthy B) in combination with two other forms of flight virus.
At the geno-general level, it is identified by other types of coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that only one difference in the minocyclopedia of certain parts of the genius of pangon and human virus.
The integral genetic comparison today showed that the largest percentage of comparisons (92%) was between the pangonevirus and SARS-CoV-2, but it is not sufficient to prove that pangolines are interim guests of virus.
The virus depression may be diagnosed immediately on the basis of symptoms, although, finally, it should be confirmed by the analysis of the polymeric cep reaction with the rear transcryption (RT-PCR) infected secret or computer theography.
The results of the studies compared to the methods of CPRC and CT used in Uhana showed that the CT is significantly more sensitive than the CCTs, although less specific, since many of its visa functions correspond to other pneumonies and disease testing processes.
Since March 2020, the American Radioology College published the recommendation “No use of CT to scratch or as a testing method in the COVID diagnosis”.
WHO published several CRC testing protocols on SARS-CoV-2 and was first published on 17 January.
Testing on a polymeric cep reaction in real time mode (RT-CPC).
It may be carried out on respiratory tests and blood images.
The results are usually ready for a few hours to a few days.
Of course, the test is used by a snake, although it can also be used by the snake, and many laboratorys and companies develop serial tests that allow anticorps to detect.
At 6 April 2020, no one of them had been sufficiently accurate to obtain the approval for the general use.
A series test developed in the United States was approved to be used in extreme cases only by certified laboratorys.
The specific features of visualization of ringgenographs and computer theography (CT) are the asymmetric peripheral memories of the mathematic type and the absence of tripartite.
The Italian radiological society is established by a international map of confirmed cases.
Because of other infections, such as adenavirus, the COVID-19 pictures not confirmed by the CCP tests are limited to clinical specification.
A large study was conducted in China, compared with the results of the CCT raw cell and testing of the CCD, and it was explained that, although the pictures are less specific for infection, they can be decrypted quickly and more sensitive, and therefore the diagnostic method can be considered as an instrument for infected areas.
In order to diagnose virus with ringgen grams and computer thematics, we have developed soft neuron networks based on art intellectual.
Prevention strategies include the maintenance of common personal physicians, hands, avoiding sighting, legs or smells, use in the box or smells of salt, which should be elected immediately after the use.
Those who may already have been shocked should be obtained by the medical mask in human places.
In order to prevent the transmission of diseases, many Governments also recommend to stay away from any urgent travel to countries and regions suffering and limit the movement of citizens.
However, virus could be distributed in most of the world regions.
This means that virus is distributed among the populations whose members do not know where and how they were infected, and medical workers who are able to be infected are recommended to use standard precautions and precautions in contact with other people and eye protection means.
The use of citizens data with their mobile phones was concerned about the compliance of confidentiality, and the organizations, such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), and more than 100 other organizations, have expressed the statements required to restrict human observance.
A number of mobile applications for voluntary use were developed and proposed; more than ten experts were working on the development of decisions on personal data, for example, the registration of the user close to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user was closely contacted with a person whose COVID XIX test was positive, he receives the relevant notification.
Currently, there is no vaccine from COVID-19, although many organizations are working on its establishment.
The brake is recommended in order to prevent the dissemination of disease.
CDC (The Centre of Control and Prevention of Diseases) also recommends that the hands of milk and water are more than 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with strong pollutant hands, as well as before food, after mourning, chair or wound.
This is necessary, because, outside human body, virus is destroyed by a raw milk that covers its protective shelter.
Furthermore, if milk and water is not available, CDC recommends to use deficiencies for hand-based hand processing at least 60 per cent of the squirrel content.
WHO recommends that people avoid associations with the eyes, legs or smells of the hands.
The adverseness can be dispersed by a number of dispersions (in the surface of the nervous surface has become deficiency instruments starting to operate a minute later after the date) with the content of 62 to 71 per cent of the stain, 50 to 100 per cent of the disproportionate, 0.1 per cent of the hydrochloride, 0.5 per cent of the hydrochloride and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent of the video.
Other components, such as benzolconic chloride and chloroxyna, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in case of suspicion for COVID or its confirmation, such as office or daily station, all spaces such as cabinets, toilets, general use, electronic equipment, such as planners, sensor screens, claviers, distance management and banks used by sick people.
Medical organizations are recommended to close the mouth and the smell part of the ball or salphate, and to immediately select the hygienic objects used.
Those who may be infected are recommended to use medical masks because the use of the mask can limit the quantity and the range of exhibition products that are divided in the air during conversation, depression and cash.
The WHO issued instructions on the use of medication mass.
According to Steven Griffin, a virusist from the University of Lids, “the use of medical mass can reduce the culmination of people with respect to their persons, and the accession to the individuals of the clean hands is the main way of infecting”.
The WHO recommends that healthy people bring medications, only if they are at high risk, for example, to persons who care for COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of the mask, really, allows to reduce the number of associations to persons.
A number of countries began to call for the use of medical mass in public places.
The CDC, the United States, recommended to bring the skin mass of inmedicin assignment, and China individually emphasized the importance of using single healthy people, especially if they are closely contacted (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to take medical mask into public transport or human locations.
Tayland health officials encourage people to prepare persons with sweet mass in home conditions and to shoot them daily.
The Czech Republic and the Slovakian citizens are prohibited to go on the street without mass closing nodo and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Vietnam requested all citizens to bring massacres to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government imposed all the visitors of product shops to hope medical masks.
The Israeli Government was also requested to citizens to make a mask in public places.
On 1 April in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks are produced from the middle of March, all passengers were required to use medical masks in trains and between buses.
In Panama, people were required to take a medical mask in the street, so the people who could not get the mask was recommended to shoot them in home conditions.
Medical masks are also widely used by the people of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (as well known as physical distance) is an action to combat infection aimed at slowing dissemination of diseases by minimising close contacts between people.
Protection measures relate to the career, travel restrictions, school closure, workplaces, stations, theatres and trade centres.
People can use social distance measures by remaining home, restricting travels, avoiding human places, using uncontact welcomes and physically distant from others.
Many regional governments, especially extremely affected by suffering, currently prescribe or recommend social distanciation.
The maximum number of people who could be gathered in one place in accordance with the recommendation of the United States government and health organizations was operationally decreased, starting from 250 people (in regions where no COVID-19 data had been distributed) to 50 and later to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited the gathering of more than two people. The older persons and persons suffering from illnesses such as diabetes, heart diseases, respirator diseases, hypertension and deteriorate immune systems are affected by a higher risk of disease in a serious form. CDC recommends that they be stayed at home, if in the region is observed by the illness of disease. At the end of March 2020, WA and other health bodies began to replace the use of the “social dystation” of the “social dystation” in such a manner.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood so that people should be subject to full social isolation, instead of staying in contact with other people with alternative ways. Some states publish sexual health guidelines that should be used during the pandemic.
Among others, the recommendations were given to enter into sex only with your permanent partners with which you live, and you are convinced that there is no virus and its symptoms.
The patients with COVID-19 diagnosis and the suspected persons that they are infiltrated are recommended for self-resolution in home conditions.

Strategy to combat illness includes the maintenance of dissemination of diseases, disadvantage or relief.
The maintenance of the dissemination of diseases is at early stages and aims to monitor and exclude infected people, and underlines other infective control and vaccination measures to stop dissemination of disease among the rest of the population.
When dissemination is already impossible, efforts are made to reduce the consequences: measures are taken to reduce dissemination and improve epidemic effects on the health system and society.
Detention measures and reducing the consequences of dissemination of diseases may be taken at the same time.
Infection infection requires more extreme measures to recover pandemia, reduce the base of the case of infection at the level below 1. part of the infection management efforts aimed at decreasing epidemic pipe, known as the epidemic crisis.
Such efforts are reduced the risk of health income and provide more time to develop vaccine and treatment methods.
Nepharmaceutical interventions that can help to deal with illness include personal prevention measures, such as hygiene hands, use of medical mass and self-reliance; public measures aimed at physical distance, such as the closing school and the elimination of mass activities; the participation of the community to assist in the implementation of such measures and participation in them; as well as measures for environmental protection, such as the cleaning of surfaces.

In South Korea, massive squering and localized currencies were introduced, and were also organized the reporting system for the movement of persons informed.
In Singapore, the financial support was provided to individed persons on self-isolation and had granted great costs for those who did not.
In Thailand, the production of medication mass and strikes were increased, and the modelling on Britain and the United States showed that there are serious problems regarding the mixture (as not the stop of dissemination of epidemia) and epidemia (the growth of epidemia).
Optimum policy on dissemination effects may reduce the loading of the health system to 2/3, and mortality is two, but it is still to bring hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems to hundreds of thousands.
The injury may be a preferential method, but it is necessary to use until the virus circle among the population (or until the vaccine is developed before), because, in other cases, the dissemination of diseases will be quickly renewed when the measures are deficienciated.
Long-term participation in the allocation of pandemics leads to social and economic costs.

The Director-General of the WHO said that “the WHO is deeply concerned as the high level of dissemination and serious disease, and at least the deficiency level in relation to this problem”, is a serious critical of the inadequate approach to pandemic understanding, including the later declaration of an emergency situation in the field of public health and classification of virus as pandemia.
As a respondent negative reaction to the situation in the address of the Director-General of the WHO, Mr. Tedros Adama was sent for a request to make a departure signed by 733.000 persons on 6 April.
26 March 2020, United Nations human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting every human rights during the pandemic COVID-19.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to apply to its measures to save life and the responsibility for the organization of such measures was to be taken by the Government.
The Panel emphasized that the absence of resources or medical insurance should not be justified for discrimination against a specific group of people.
Experts stressed that every person had the right to health protection, including persons with limited opportunities, minority groups of elderly citizens, internal displaced persons without home, citizens who live in extremely bad conditions, prisoners, and refugees and other non-standard groups needing public support.
International Government organizations consider the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform designed to provide a timely and comprehensive information on relevant political measures in all countries, as well as for awareness of views and recommendations.
The digital area contains information on the political measures of different countries (Political Tracker) to strengthen health and world economy systems, eliminate the carton impact and travel limits, with a view to helping countries to learn to each other and to promote coordinated global response measures to combat coronavirus.
The Government of China was criticized by the United States, the Minister of Ministers of the United States, Michael Howa and Eduardo Bolsonar, the son of President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonar, for the action to combat pandemia, which began from the Chinese province of Hubay.
Many leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CKK) were allowed for the careful measures they were taken in the central part of China, and these volunteers demonstrated that the non-responsibilities of the political convergence in these regions were incompatible.
Some comments believe that this step had been aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China S Zzinipan from the angry of the public about the raising of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Chao Lizzanjan, expressed an inconvenience with the previous statement that the slowness of the coronavirus began in Uhana, but took part of the controversial theory, according to which COVID-19 occurred in the United States or Italy.
The Administration of the United States President Donald Trampa called the “China Virus” or “Uhanya’s Virus,” said that “the century in China is only injured to the situation of a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” and this expression was expressed in its mind by some comments that claim that this approach is racist and “except from the incapacity of the Administration of the United States ' s president ' s dissemination of diseases”.
The Daily Beast received access to the United States government telegram, which contains a communication strategic strict, as visible by the Council of National Security, which has the place to mention the following strategy: “All cases in China.
We are requested to distribute this information in any possible way, including press conferences and television statements.” such organizations, such as Politicals, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg, have stated that China's efforts to help countries suffering from virus are part of the “Propagandist” to obtain global impact.
Head of the external policy State EU Joseph Borrell warned the presence of a geopolitical component including the fight against the influence of the pira and the so-called policy of generosity.
Borrell also stated that “China continues to go on the idea of his role of a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States”.
China also urged the United States to reject sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some information to send assistance to the last two countries.
The donation of Jacques M 100 000 of Cuban medical mass was banned by the United States sanctions provided on 3 April.
U.S. authorities are also accused of transfering assistance for other countries to their own country.
There were also disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Czech and Italy.
Moreover, Turkey has brought hundreds of IDP devices for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government discovered the lack of support by the European Union towards the covering coronavirus of Italy.
Mauricio Massari, Italian embassy in the EU, said that “China has reacted in bilateral rule.
This does not clearly indicate European solidarity."
On 22 March, after the phone conversation with the Prime Minister of Italy, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, organized a sent to Italy of Russian military sanitaries, specialized for desinfection and other medical equipment.
Italian newspaper La Prespa quotes the anonymous “Political Source of High Level” which claims that 80% of Russian aid was “bespot or little useful for Italy”.
The Source accused Russia that it is trying to make a good impression on the world public at the geopolitical and diplomatic level.
President Lombardria Attilalio Fundain and the Minister for Foreign Affairs Italy, Louisi Di Mayo rejected the attacks of the media and expressed appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a shipping flight with medical assistance to the United States.
The secretariat Krimla Dmitri Pesko said that “Assistance to the American College, [Putin] suggests that when the American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are able to produce the time of production, they will also be able to provide answering assistance in the case of need.”
NATO Military Teaches, planned in Germany, Poland and Baltic countries, will be conducted in a decreased format.
The Secretary-General for Nuclear Disarmament Championship Kate Hudson has declared: “In the crisis situation today in public health, these teachings are threatened to live not only by the United States and many European participant countries but also by the people in which such events should be carried out,” the Government of Iran has been extremely affected by the virus. It is identified by about two decades of parliament and 15 other current or former political officials.
On 14 March 2020, President of Iran Husan Ruhani in an open letter requested world leaders, reporting that his country has experienced difficulty in combating the epidemic because of the absence of access to international markets in relation to the United States sanctions against Iran. Epidemia has generated calls to the United States to adopt social policy distributed in other state countries, including the inclusion of a single health system and the income of children payable for familie conditions and the increased financing of public health.
Politologs expected that this could be negatively affected by Donald Trampa's possibilities to re-elect the presidential elections in 2020, and that the pandemic relationship between Japan and South Korea was deteriorated.
South Korea was discovered by “inconsistent and passive career measures” by Japan after announcing that any citizen who arrived from South Korea will be placed on a two-weekly candidate to the Government's special posts.
The South Korean society has been markedly separated by the reaction of President Mun Joyna to the crisis.
Many Coreans signed the complaints that the President had acknowledged or called upon Mr. Mun to issue an implication for an inadequate reaction of the Government to the illness. Pandemia urged the country to adopt laws on emergency situations as a response.
Some comments express concern that this step allows Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the Parliament had proclaimed that the Prime Minister Victor Orban was providing immediately the right to manage the work of the parliament, to carry out elections and to punish those who would be accused of dissemination of factual information on virus and government measures to combat crisis.
The use of the coronavir has been called as a result of a number of cases of delivery deficit in relation to a global increase in use of epidemia, purchase of goods in the packages and shocks of production and logistic operations.
The United States Food Control Administration and Medical Products Warning has been warned for the lack of medicines and medical equipment, which has resulted in increased consumer demand and losses in the supplier work.
In several pools, panic purchase was also placed; this resulted in the situation in which goods of the first needs were lost, such as food products, toilet papers and slaughtered water, which, in turn, led to the deficit of stocks.
In particular, the technologie industry warns delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to the Director-General of the WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanum, the demand for individual protection is 100 times.
This scale has led to a twenty-third growth of prices compared to the common value, as well as the delay of the allocation of medical allocations for four-month months.
He also argued the lack of personal protection in the world, and WHO warned that health workers were attacked by this reason.
In Australia, there was a new opportunity to sell Australian goods in China with regard to the Pandemia of the Daigo system.
This was a lack of child food in some supermarkets and was then prohibited by the Government of Australia, despite the high dissemination of COVID-19 in North Italy and the Hungary region, and the high demand for food demand, both areas have been able to avoid the disadvantage of food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the stocking and illicit trade of substances and critical products that have succeeded have enabled to avoid the deficiency of food expected in Europe and North America.
North Italy, a agricultural production with small scales, has not proved significant falls, but, in view of the sector representatives, agricultural prices can grow.
Food shops were only temporary, even in the city of Uhan, while the Chinese government officials provided the access to the pornographic stocks to ensure the full nutrition of the population.
Similar laws required by food manufacturers for food conservation in cases of emergency are also existed in Italy.
The damage of the world economy was reflected in China: According to the media data dated 16 March, China's economy has suffered strongly in the first two months of 2020 because of the measures to combat the dissemination of virus adopted by the Government, resulting in which the volume of decreased sales was decreased by 20.5 per cent.
The mother of China is a large economic and productive centre, so the virus is considered to be a serious destabilization threat to the world economy.
According to Yate Damari, Economist Intelligence Unit, market guarantees will be maintained until possible results are not more clearly presented.
In January 2020, some analysts pointed out that the economic impacts of current epidemics in global growth could overcome the typical epidemia of 2002-2004.
One of the evaluations made by the University of St. Louis at St. Louis, the damage of the world's supply cemetery may exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact may extend to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Pet Exporters (OECD) has become to take “urgent measures” after a decrease in the decline of the oil prices of China's demand.
24 February, World Funds markets have been increased from a significant increase in the number of people infected by COVID-19 in the borders of China material.
On 27 February, the growing threats to the injury of the coronavirus various United States fund indexes, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dou-Jons-Index for industrial companies, demonstrated the most slowest decline since 2008, and the Dou Index slowed to paragraph 1191 — the most single fall after the financial crisis 2007-2008.
At the end of the week, three indexes demonstrated more than 10 per cent decline.
On 28 February, the Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the sovereign credit rating of China, but maintained a negative prognosis.
Actions have again fallen because of the fears of the dissemination of coronavirus, and the largest fall was 16 March.
Many believe that economic recession is possible.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian gave a high evaluation of the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond to more rapidly than at the time of the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most afflicted sectors in respect of movement bans, public closing, including tourist adjustments, and Government recommendations not to take any journeys.
As a result of all of these measures, many aircrafts have deleted rails because of a slight reduction of aircraft, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British Regional Aviation Corporation Flybe has stopped existing.
The negative impact on the crowd industry was as ever strong.
There were also several weight stations and swimming ports.
Epidemia was joined by the main tourist season of China’s new-day celebrations.
National and regional Governments have been abolished by a number of activities that participate in a large number of people, including annual newties, and private companies also closed their business and tourist adherences, such as the Hong Kong and the Shanghai Disease.
Many new events have been cancelled, and tourist adherence was closed to prevent the mass collections of people; for example, in Beijing the Prohibition city was closed and traditional temple halls were abolished.
In 24 of 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended a new channel until 10 February, the majority of firms had not been opened before that date.
In these regions, 80 per cent of the country GDP and 90 per cent of exports were exported.
Hong Kong authorities have highlighted the reactions to infective diseases to the very high and announced an emergency situation, closing schools to March and cancelling the New Year celebration.
Visiting points of small trade in Europe and Latin America has reduced 40 per cent.
In North America and the Middle East, sales were reduced by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, the visit of trade centres was 33 to 43 per cent compared to February.
Operators of the Trade Centres worldwide have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitary conditions, installations for the verification of the temperature of visitors and the cancellation of activities. According to the evaluation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America, which is called Pandemia, may leave the poverty of 14 to 22 million more than the same situation, but without pandemic.
In January and February 2020, the epidemic in Uhana lost about 5 million people in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese immigrants have been home in the provinces of their country or in the province of Hubay, and more than 10 million Americans lost their workplaces and have been sent to the Government in March 2020.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank, the Coronavir has been able to lose 47 million workplaces in the United States, and the unemployed level can reach 32 per cent. The self-resolution measures introduced in India remained without the work of decades of million Indian migrant workers receiving daily payment; the investigation carried out by the Angusa Reyd Institute showed that 44 per cent of Canadian homes was not worked.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers gave statements to timely unemployment, and 1 million British workers received a single social payment, and about 50 million companies in Germany moved their staff to the subsidiary government to the decreased working schedule — an unfulfilled working day.
Germany's payment scheme for a full working day was also introduced in France and England.
Art and cultural heritage were also strongly affected by pandemia that has affected the activities of organizations and individuals, either officially working or independent, around the world.
Cultural organizations and arts have tried to support their (financed by the State) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage to society, to ensure the safety of their staff and publicity, as well as to support arts.
To March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed to the world by an undetermined time or access was differently limited, and exhibits, events and presentations were cancelled or transferred to other dates.
In addition, active efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and another recent and renewed trafficking results of the dissemination of virus — the cancellation of religious services, large sports events and other public events such as musical festivals and concerts, technological conferences and modes.
In the film industry, Vatican also announced the cancellation of the Treasury Week in Rome, which are conducted at the last week of the Christian repentant period — the Great Age.
Many epargy recommend that older Christians stay home and not visit the Sunday Services; in some churches, church services began to translating radio, direct eternity or television while some church leaders offer God’s service in open air.
The Roman Catholic epargy of Rome was closed to visit their churches, Times and areas of the Holy Peter, where there are no longer Christian rulers, and later other religious organizations also abolished godly service and limited access to public godly service in churches, swords, synagogues, temples and horrors.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the delete of fifty-year prayers in areas suffering from the slaughter of the coronavirus, and the sanctuary was closed later; Saudi Arabia prohibited access to foreign pillars and its own inhabitants in the sanctuary of Mekka and Media.
Pandemia has made the most significant change in the global sport events since the second World War.
Most large sports events have been cancelled or transferred, including WEFA 2019-20, Premier Line 2019-20, Euro-2020 WEFA, NBA 2019-20 and NCHL 2019-20 season.
The coronavir also destroyed the plans of the Year Olympic Games of 2020 that were to begin at the end of July; on 24 March the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “translated after 2020, but not later 2021”.
This resulted in a significant increase in the number of players in the online network, and many websites dedicated to the azart games reported that the number of new signers had also suffered because different music groups have been suspended or deleted.
Many major theatres, such as the Brodovaians, also cancelled all their spectacles.
As a traditional alternative, some artists and musicians began to study the options to continue their activities and to exchange their Internet results, organize direct transmissions of online concerts or web festivals; this helps people to continue to implement, release or publish their events.
In the network, numerous internet-members have occurred on the subject of coronavirus, many of which are ambitious and concernful for the period of incertitude.
Since the exhibition of COVID-19, it has been noted that the pre-accession, xenophobia and racism of Chinese citizens and the people of East Asian origin, as well as the representatives of the population of the horrible points of Europe, the United States and other countries.
The situations of fear, suspicion and enemy were observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific region.
In February (the majority of the infringements still have been limited by China) racist instruments expressed in different groups of worldwide against Chinese citizens, which were likely to be obtained by this virus or have received a fair return for anything.
In some African countries the growth of anti-China is also observed.
Many of Uhana and Jubai have reported on discrimination on the sign of their regional origin.
Chinese citizens, as well as those who live in the infected virus, were supported both in the Ofland and online rejim.
Epidemium began to be distributed in new countries, in particular in Italy, the first in Europe, with a serious COVID-19 involvement; the citizens of such regions can also begin to feel the influence of suspicion and xenophobia; the citizens of such countries, such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, were signed in the early stage, to prohibite the invitation of entering China citizens in their country to maintain epidemia.
In Japan, Chinese DontComeToJapan (#China #Price to Japan) has undertaken leadership positions in Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report on the growing level of racism and even attacks.
The President of the United States Donald Trump was criticized by the fact that he was called “China Virus”; the critics believe that it was racist and anti-China.
In Ukraine, protesters were attacked by bus transported to the New Sanders of Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Uhana.
Students who came from the border with China of North-East India and trained in large cities of India reported cases of persecution related to coronavirus.
Dilip Gosh, President of the State Unit of the Bharratja Janat Party, Western Bengal, said that the Chineses had destroyed the nature and “this God has denied them”.
Afterwards these statements were condemned by the Chinese console in Calcutta, called their “false”; in China, the pandemics renewed xenophobia and racism for the people who were not Chinese citizens: foreigners have become called the "foreign museum" and objects that were subject to "utilization".
Many newspapers have eliminated such limitations for some or all regions suffering from coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made open access to their scientific articles dedicated to the coronavirus.
Some scientists have decided to make short-term access to their research on the publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory testing of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) and related virus of SARS-CoV-2 includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus and the anticorps detecting methods of infection.
The presence of virus in the images is confirmed by the OT-CPC, which recognises the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed only for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
The discovery of anticorps (cerology) may apply both for diagnosis and for population control.
The anti-corn analysis shows the number of persons transferred to disease, including those who were too poor to treat them in the hospital or were not insufficient.
The precise mortality level from this disease and collective immunity can be determined on the results of such test.
In March 2020, there was no reliable testing data on the dissemination of virus among the population in any country.
On 23 March, no country was able to check more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests carried out in different countries is very contrary.
Such differences may have significantly affected the registered mortality rates that may be significantly overcome in some countries.
Using a polymeric cep reaction of rear-time transscription (rRT-PCR) the test can be tested on tests of the respiratory ways obtained in different ways, including a shock or a microbike image.
The results are generally available for a few hours to 2 days.
The OT-CPR test carried out on skins taken from the wolf is only during the first week of disease.
After all, virus can disappear from the wolf, however, continue to grow into light.
Patients tested for the second week of disease may be taken as an alternative from lower respiratory ways using the sequenced category, or can be used for discharging products (mocrote).
One of the early tests of the CDP was developed in the Charite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a polymerical transcription reaction in real time (rRT-PCR) and read 2500,000 arrangements, which later distributed the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom has also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenbiotech has developed a set for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 based on the clinical CCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
He identified the "E" genius for all beta-CoV-2, and the gen RdRp, special for SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese Group was one of the first companies that have received authorisation by the National Medical Management of China for the extreme use of the SARS-CoV-2 sets on the basis of PCC. In the United States, the Control and Protection Centres (CDC) distributed through the organization of International Reagence Resources Resources for its effective RT-PCCC (20-19-Novel Coronavirus (20-20) ReV-CoV-Time Diagnostic Panel.
One of the three genetic tests from the older versions of the test test has produced incomplete results in the cause of marriage reagents and the large testing area carried out in Atlanta, resulting in the average period of February 2020, at least 100 samples per day have been processed.
Two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date, the State and local labs were allowed to start testing.
Testing was approved by the Office for Food and Medicine Oversight within the extreme application permit, and the United States Common Lab began testing early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorrp announced the possibility of testing COVID-19 based on RT-CPR throughout the country.
This diagnosis began testing in COVID-19 throughout the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitations were claimed; the processing and processing of analysis should be implemented in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID test was developed and developed by the State Science and Research Centre for Virusology and Biotechnology VACTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the Federal Health Surveillance Service was registered in the test, reported that Mayo had developed a test to detect COVID infection. The Roche Diagnostics received FDA's approval for use of tests, which could take place for 3.5 hours of large tests, which allows one machine to process about 4128 tests during 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA has issued extreme permission to the Abbott laboratory for testing systems of Abbott m2000; previously, FDA has issued similar permission to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepness also received from the USFDA for about 45 minutes of testing.
The FDA also approved the test instead of using the CCP technology of the isothermal nuclein oxygen.
As the test does not require a series of temperature cycles, this method can detect the positive results for only five minutes, and the negative cycles are 13 minutes.
Today, the United States is about 18 000 such cars, and Abbott plans to increase up to 50 000 tests per day, and in Taiwan it is currently designed with the use of a monocratic anti-tell that is specifically linked to a new coronary white (N-Black) and is hoped to get results over 15-20 minutes, such as grip express.
In the review of the specialized literature in March 2020, it is concluded that “rentgen cycles of raw cells have a small diagnostic value at early stages, while the results of the [computer thematics] may have such value even before the symptoms were observed.”
The typical signs identified during the CT include bilateral bilateral sub-sub-sectional focuses on the type "Mathy Steel" with peripheral, asymmetric and asymmetric distribution.
Subventional domination, the symptoms of bottle and consolidation are developing in the progress of disease.
The results of the studies compared to the methods of CPRC and CT used in Uhana at the time of the current pandemic showed that the CCT is significantly sensitive than the CCTs, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions correspond to other pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American Radioology College published the recommendation “No use of CT to shrinch or as a method of testing of the first COVID diagnosis”.
Particular immune response to the infection is expressed in the anticorps processing, including IgM and IgG.
These antiquities may be used to detect infections after the 7th day of existence of symptoms, for immunity and for population control. Analysis may be carried out in central laboratorys (CLT) or by diagnosing on place (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratorys, these analysis will be able to implement high-productive automaticized systems, but their access will depend on the speed of each system.
The CLT usually uses one of the figures of peripheral blood, although immunal responses may also be applied to series.
In PoCT, one image of blood is generally obtained by the propulsion of each claw.
Unlike the GDP methods, the blood testing stage was not required. On 26 March 2020, FDA was called 29 organizations who interrupted all the necessary registration procedures and now could distribute their anti-lich tests.
As at 7 April 2020, FDA adopted only one test on extreme application. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations to use its testing arrangements that could be identified in the images of IgG and IgA blood in which the virus could be able to fight.
The productivity of testing has a number of hundreds of figures during a few hours and therefore the method works much higher than the normal CCP analysis of viral RNA.
The antiquity is generally identified after 14 days after the infection, and in April, the United Kingdom found that no of its acquired anti-corps analysis was satisfied.
In Hong Kong, a schedule was developed to allow patients to sustain the virus to remain home: “All partners of the indirect assistance are transferred to the patient to the image,” the patient returns to the test results. The British NHS announced the launching of their pilot test scheme in home conditions that eliminates the risk of exposure by other clinical visitors, or the need to determine the machine if it was used for the transmission of the patient.
Centers of Express Testing helped South Korea organize one of the fast and wide test procedures than any other country. 2 March in Germany, the National Medical Association for Compulsory Medical Insurance stated that it was ready to carry out about 12 000 tests a day in an ambulatory conditions, and only 10 700 weeks ago.
If the investigation is appointed to the doctor, the expenditure of medical insurance is covered.
According to the President of the Robert Coha Institute, the general productivity of Germany in testing is 160,000 tests a week.
On 19 March, it was proposed to conduct exams tests in several major cities.
On 26 March 2020, a general number of tests provided in Germany was unknown because only positive results were registered.
The first laboratory survey showed that, at the timeline of 12/2020 at SARS-CoV-2, at least 483 295 analysis, at the week 12/2020, and 33 491 images (6,9%) were positive. Israeli clinical Technion and Rambam Hospital have developed and tested the only timely testing methods taken in 64 patients, together with images and further analysis in the case only if a combinated congestional result was made. WHN 5 2020 was opened in the BG at the same time.
The structure of this laboratory was organized by the BGI Van Zyanum founder and had been completed for only 5 days; the model showed that if this lab was not introduced in such an accelerated time, there would be more than 47 per cent of the disease in Jubai and, accordingly, the career costs were two times above.
The laboratory in Uhan was immediately opened by the Hoo-Yung Lab in Shenjjen, Tunisia, Beijing and Shanhae, in the general complexity of 12 cities in China.
On 4 March 2020, the daily overall rates of passenger have been 500,000 tests per day, and open multiplay schemes of Origami Assays, which can test up to 1 122 COVID analysis by using only 93 trials; these balanced constructions can work in small labs, except the need for use of iron-based manipulators.
In March, as regards the lack and lack of reagents, the EU, Britain and the United States was a problem of mass testing.
As a result, some authors requested the processing protocols of testing, which provides the increment of the figures at 98°C (208°F), within 5 minutes for the release of RNA genes for further testing. 31 March, it was announced that the number of tests on the coronavirus, which the United Arab Emirates currently conducted to the population, exceeds the indicators of any other country, and the large population will soon be protested.
This was due to the possibilities of expressing, along with the acquisition of the Group 42 and the BGI of the population mass testing lab (constituted on the basis of their laboratory for identifying emergency cases in Huo-Yung in China).
The lab, launched for 14 days, is possible to carry out decades of thousands of RTD tests in the day and is the first of the world's laboratory so large that works beyond China.
Different test options aimed at various parts of the coronavir profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hungary, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German selection of test instruments that are sent to the country with low income, without resources to develop their own instruments.
The German option was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Health and Epidemiological Centres was unexpected until 28 January, which resulted in the lack of testing arrangements in the United States. At the beginning, China and the United States had experienced problems with the safety of tests, and these countries, and Australia, had not been able to provide sufficient selections recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, as experts say, the broad access to testing has helped to reduce the dissemination of the new coronavirus.
Over a few years, the Government of South Korea has worked to provide testing opportunities, mainly in private laboratorys.
16 March, the World Health Organization called on to encourage the development of testing programmes as the best way to reduce the dissemination of COVID-19 pandemics, resulting in the growth of testing due to the rapid dissemination of virus, many United States private laboratories in which hundreds of thousands of analysis had been loaded, and stocks for massacres and chemical reactors were quickly implemented.
In March 2020, China reported the problems with the accuracy of its test complexs.
The American Test Complex, developed by CDC, had “insufficients” and, as a result, the Government removed bureaucratic barriers that hindered private testing. Spain acquired test collections in the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd but found that the results of the use of these samples were unspectacular.
The company explained that the cause of uncertainty of results could be an inadequate set of figures or the wrong use of the samples.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would be sent to non-determined results and replaced by other samples by the Shenzhen Bioeasy company. 80 per cent of the testing arrangements acquired in China were also uncertain.
The Prime Minister Matovic suggested to leave them in Dúnea, Athesh Kara, a member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test collections acquired in China had had a high level of errors, and the Ministry “is not used”. The United Kingdom purchased 3,5 million tests in China, but was announced at the beginning of April 2020.
Cardiac measures for persons whose analysis had a positive result on SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring of patients contacted such patients had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V, where the first person died from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two cycles of total population testing with approximately 3400 people per day.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed diseases were placed at the career.
The entry into the territory of the population was closed, and this measure was fully stopped the dissemination of infections.
In the intensive monitoring of contacts, the income restrictions, testing and the care of the coronavir 2020 pandemic in Singapore, there was much less tension than other developed countries, and there was no need to introduce extreme limitations such as the closement of restaurants and shops.
Many of the events there were cancelled, and 28 March Singapore began urging the people to stay home, but schools, channels in which 23 March were finished, were opened on the calendar.
A number of other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also conducted pandemics through intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing, and carriage measures, but the limitations were less aggressive.
Statistical research showed that, in countries where more tests were performed in comparison with the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because there were more patients who have been exposed to a weak symptoms or the lack of symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratory with limited work experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive and first 10 negative results for COVID-19 into one of 16 WHO control laboratorys to confirm testing.
7 of these 16 control labs are in Asia, 5 to Europe, 2 to Africa, 1 to North America and 1 in Australia.
The next graph of the “positive result” column depends on the testing policies adopted in a country.
The country, in which only hospitalized patients are tested, will have a higher positive result in percentages compared to the country in which all citizens are tested, despite the existence of virus symptoms, with other equivalent conditions.
The hands, also known as “guigan hands” are the process of purification of hands in order to eliminate contamination, grass, micro-organism or other harmful substances.
The regular brake with milk in certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the dissemination of many diseases, such as diarrees and collars that are transmised physically.
Man may also be infected by respirator diseases, such as grip or ordinary simply, for example, if it is touched to the eyes, feet or smells (again to the slicistic sleeves) with the hands of the smell.
Five critical moments during the day after which hands should be cut with milk: before and after defectation, after the mixture of the child or the changes of the undergrounds, before the child’s grain, before the food, and before and after the preparation of food or processing of soft meat, fish and home birds.
If water and milk are not available, hands can be cleaned using the zone, and the World Health Organization recommends to swallow hands:
Before, at the time and after the preparation.
Before and after the procedure of the ill man.
After changes of suburbs or smells of a child in the toilet.
After disappointment, box or smell.
After the accession to animals, raws or wastes of animal origin.
Medical hygiene hands relate to hygiene activities related to medical procedures.
The hands before receiving medicines or medical procedures are enabled to prevent or minimise diseases.
The basic medical goal of the hand is in the cleaning of the hands of pathogenes (batters, virus or other microorganisms that can cause disease), as well as chemical substances that may be affected or caused certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are working in the preparation of food or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all other people.
The hands of health are very useful: for example, it constitutes minimal dissemination of grip, coronavir and other infectious diseases, prevents infections of diarea, reduces the infection of replicator infections,
also reduces the rate of adolescent mortality at home species.
The 2013 study showed that a higher hand can lead to a small increase in the growth of children up to five years of age.
In developing countries, children ' s mortality rates related to reservoir and diarree diseases may be reduced by reducing simplicity, such as brain hands.
This elementary procedure will be able to reduce the mortality level of these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular memories on the use of hands may decrease the number of cases of diarea about third, which compare with the use of regions with low water income.
The reduction in the number of cases of diarrees of 48 per cent may be related to milk hands, which is the only effective and inconsistent way to prevent diarrees and strict respirator diseases (ORGs) in terms of the processing of relevant responsibilities in each house, in schools and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ORI, is the main cause of mortality among children under five years of age, which brings about 1,8 million children a year.
A total of 3,5 million children died annually from diarrees and pneumonia.
The United Nations Child Fund reports that the milk hands before the food and after the toilet, which has made a strong approximation, could save more life than any individually taken vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the mortality of diarrees almost two and the mortality of the respirator infections to four.
The hands are usually associated with other sanitary activities carried out in the framework of water supply, sanitary and hygiene (WASH).
The brain also prevents the emergence of the impetus – disease that is transmitted in direct physical contact.
A few negative consequences of a frequent hand is that it can lead to the extinction of the skin and then to its damage.
In 2012, a data study showed that too often the brain can lead to skin and skin skin – to disease known as an extraterrence or demate, which is particularly distributed among health workers.
The hands may also be considered as a symptom of the consecutive and compulsive disorder.
There are five such "critical moments" during the day when the hands with milk are important to reduce the risk of physical and oral transmission of disease: after empty (making, defective), after the smell of the child (substitute) before the child's infringement, before the food and/or the preparation of food or the processing of seed meat, fish or birds.
Some other cases, when hands should be made to prevent the transmission of disease: before or after the treatment of skin or wounds, after healing, cash or smiling, after addicting from animal origin or animals, after adherence to the museum.
In many countries, the brain hands with milk have been very poor.
A study conducted in 2015 in 54 countries showed that the average of 38.7 per cent of the family with milk was a general acceptable practice. In 2014, the highest rate, 97 per cent, was fixed in the Saudi Arabia; in this list, the United States is nearly at the average, the 77 per cent of their family; the lowest rate was fixed in China – 23 per cent. At present there were a number of methods of changes in behavior and processing in the midst situations. In the developing country, we are in a group of schools at a time, the lowest methodology that helps children.
“Insufficient medical assistance programme” carried out by the Ministry of Education to Philippian, is an example of broad-scale activities to strengthen child health and child education.
The national programme is based on deregulation, which is two times a year, as well as daily hands with milk and daily dental cleaning.
The same programme is successfully carried out in Indonesia.
Deletion of microorganisms from each cluster is more effective if the museum process adds milk or my means.
The main action of milk and my resources is to eliminate barriers to decrease and improve its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective means for skin cleaning, because grains and skins, which are organic pollutant components, are badly manufactured in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the cleaning process.
The thirst nitrogen, due to multidimensional use, may also contain bacteria that may be covered in previous use.
A small number of studies dedicated to each bacteria with polluted steel cush, says that such a fall is little likely, since bacteria is cut off from the pig.
The CCC still states that “the frozen milk with the hands of the retreat is a preferential option for the brain of the hand”.
The antibodiesal milk is actively advertised in communities concerned with their health.
Today there is no evidence that the use of recommended anti-septics or dismissing means has an electoral impact on organs that have sustainability to antibiotics in their nature.
However, the antibactric milk contains distributed antibactrial agents, such as triculumsan, which are sustained by a number of resistant organisms.
Thus, even if antibiotic stams are not elected in relation to antibactrial milk, their effectiveness may not correspond to the advertised.
In addition to surface-active substances and card protection, complex combinations can contain oxygen (oxygen, astrain, milk) as a regulator of RN, as well as antimotive active banane oxygen and other dioxide (loe of faith, vitamin, biliums, vegetables extracts), a comprehensive analysis carried out by the University of the Public Health, shows that in the plan of prevention of diseases and elimination of bacteria with the hands, efficiency, and anti-balances of the three-classs.
The heat water for human hair is still not enough to kill bacteria.
bacteria is widely multiplied at the temperature of the body 37°C.
However, for the removal of natural grains that keep polluting and bacteria, milk water is more effective than cold.
In contrast to the public view, scientific research showed that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of the microwave.
The deficiency of the hand (Sanitazer) or the antiseptic for the hand is a guiding tool that does not contain water.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21th century, the popularity of the materials for hydraulic hands (as well known as the deficiency of the hands, anti-septical means for the declination of hands or sanitairs).
Most of these instruments are made on the basis of an isolated sphere or theory with the addition of proteins, such as carbon (acкри oxygen polymers) in the form of geel, or nuts such as glucerine in a iron or drinking form, which ensure the use of these materials and the reduced effects of the sperm skin.
The addition of the renewal of the hydrocarbon increases the anti-motive activity, and the determining means containing at least 60-95 per cent of the sphere effectively destroyed micro.
Deficit-based bacteria kills bacteria, including bacteria with multimedial drug sustainability (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis ball, and some virus (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, glup and hepatitis) and grips.
The deficiency of 70 per cent of the bacteria is killed by 99.97 per cent of the bacteria (logic reduction of 3.5 degrees similarly) in hands after 30 seconds after the application and 99.99 per cent of the bacteria (99.99999 per cent of the bacteria reducing 4 to 5 per minute after the application. The detection of the bacteria is most effectively against the bacteria and less effectively against some viruses.
Spectric disabled materials are practically inefficace with norrovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, most frequently caused by infection gastrointermite, and are required to use sufficient amount of anti-septics or spy-container to deal with and demand the skin from both sides.
Little and slide surface of both ladons, as well as the space between the fingers throughout the length grows for about 30 seconds until the skin, skin or ice is completely shocked.
The ends of both hands should also be carefully shocked, and the United States Control and Prevention Centre recommends to make choices in the brain, not using deficiencies, especially if the hands are extremely polluted.
The growth of these deficit means is the simple use and rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not be replaced by a full-precise mind if there is a possibility to use water and milk.
Specific use of dismissing materials in the hands of the skin may be caused if it does not contain skins and (or) skin skins.
The effects of sperm skin absorption may be reduced or eliminated by addiction of glucerine and (or) other additive substances.
In the clinical tests, the deficiency of the hands on the splitting components were significantly less skin and skin skin than milk or antimicrobic materials.
Alergic contact demate, contact symptoms or hypersensitiveness to the sphere or additives present in deficiencies are almost not occurd.
The lower probability of a devastating contactermate was a factor in choosing milk and water deficiencies.
Despite their efficiency, the means that do not contain water are cleaning the hands of organic substances, but simply decentralize them.
This is the reason for decentralization of hands not as effective as to prevent many pathogenic microorganisms as normal milk and water, since the use of such pathogical microorganisms remains on the hand.
The efficiency of the deficiency of the hand without the skill depends significantly on the components and components, and historically has been significantly lower than the sphere or the sphere.
It has been recently proved that the preparations used by the benzolconic chloride have a stable and commutative antimicrobic activity, as evidenced, loss the effectiveness of the sphere after multiple use, probably due to the progressing of every reaction.
Many people in the Communities with low income cannot allow themselves to do so and replace it with gold or grain.
Zone or grain may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than milk.
One of the problems with this means is that if grain or water polluted by microorganisms, it may, instead, increase the spread of diseases.
Like milk, the skin is a deficit, because water is a milk breeding.
If the milk is not available, WHO is recommended to use blood or skin as alternatives.
In order to prevent the infiltration of the United States Disease Control Center, they recommend the use of the brain technician, including the following stages:
Push your hands under warm or cold water.
It is recommended that protocol water be polluted, and the temperature of water is once no importance.
Help them with a large number of milks, including the thick side of the ladon, as well as the area between the fingers and under the feet.
The skin is removed from the skin, and the research shows that people are stirred to hands more carefully when they use meat (not only one water).
3 hands at least 20 seconds.
Traction helps to remove microbes from the skin, and more than you have three hands, so more microbes will be removed.
Take care of the hands under the protocol water.
The pulling of the hands in the storm water may defeat the shift.
Keep your hands out of a clean helmet, or let them swallow yourself.
Mourning and low hands are easierly polluted, and often people remain without attention, such as a large shooting, smell, field between the fingers and under the feet.
Artist legs and legs for feet can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a smooth lunar to prevent the upset of the hair that may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If the water is not available and the milk is not available, there are numerous innocent ways for hands: the extraction of water from cancers or bottle cuts with drought and (or) the use of zones, if necessary, for example, in developing countries; in areas with limited water use (e.g., in schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are water-conservation solutions, such as snakes and other sweets.
It is a simple building with a footer pipe, which is covered by a shock, and a feet market that should be pressed to swallow water on the hand; it should be used to use a piece of milk.
Effective hands are an integral part of the hygiene process, but some disputes about the most effective shape of swimming in public toilets.
The increased number of research shows that the papers are largely hygiene than the electric switchs for the hands set in many tubes.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the Westminster University, which has become the European Union for the Producing of Paper Samples and Aeroports; the study was compared to the hygiene level of paper pools, a heat air swimming pool and more modern air flows for hands.
It was observed that after the thickness and the smell of the hands in a warm air, the total number of bacteria on the fingers in the average increased by 194 per cent and the rays of 254 per cent.
It was also found that after the shoes and the skins of hands in a swimming air flow, the overall number of bacteria on the fingers increased to 42 per cent and 15 per cent in the rays.
After the skin and smooth smell, the general number of bacteria on the snakes in the midst is 76 per cent, and at the boards up to 77 per cent, and the scientists also tested the possibility of switching a number of toilet visitors and the average of the toilet in each type of sweet.
A frequency of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 km/h), a frequency of micro-organism from the hand and from its block, and potentially shocking other tube users and sandwich in the radio up to 2 m.
The use of warm air tank is distributed by micro-organism in the radio up to 0.25 meters from the sugar.
In the use of the papers, the microorganism has not been identified, and in 2005, TUD product and environment studies were conducted on the evaluation of various smooth methods.
The following changes are observed in the number of bacteria depending on the soft hand method:
There are many different manufacturers for hands, and the shoes for the hand are compared to the smooth paper pools.
The cleaning of hands with dismissing salts may be an alternative decision during the trips in the absence of milk and water.
The deficiency of the brake should be at least 60 per cent of the spurt.
The medical method of brain was obliged for a long time after the vendor doctor Ignaz Earthwellways found his high efficiency (1846) in the prevention of diseases in statistical conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind the hospital staff that they need to spend their hands if they forgot.
According to a study, the use of such devices really helps to reduce the level of infringement.
Medical brain is longed at least 15 seconds, and it is used to use a large number of milk, water or helicopters for each part of the hand.
The hands should be carefully losing each other by baptizing the fingers.
If there is a jacket under the feet, you can use a mask to remove it.
Because microbes can remain in the water that is present on their hands, it is important for them to spend well and to lose the skin of a clean helmet.
After the shooting hand, shutting the clan and, if necessary, shutting and opening any doors, the paper switch should be used.
This makes it possible to avoid repeating contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The goal of hands in medical institutions is the removal of pathogical microorganisms (Mikrobole) and the prevention of their dissemination.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the mental order remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget their hands before they get up to patients, and thus distribute microorganisms.
As a result of a study, the right hands and other elementary procedures can reduce the level of blood infections related to the use of the category at 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a letter with the image of a standard museum and hand processing that should be applied in the health sector.
The WHO instructions on the hands are also available on its website and open for public discussion.
The relevant review was carried out in the office of Whitby.
If a confirmation is required by the regulatory requirements, you can use the commercial device for measuring indicators and hygiene checks.
The World Health Organization designates “five moments” when needed:
After contact with blood or biological glucose,
Previous antiseptics, and
Appendixing anti-septic chemicals to milk with the hands of the “medicina” or “antivic” mile helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibactrial properties may be necessary before the operation of surgical operations or in the environment of high content of organs to antibiotics. For the “living” hand before the surgical operation, the corn is required to include and exclude, not in relation to its hands; it should also be used to use a little clorgyxine or a ice water to swift hands, steriled hands for smelling after the snake, sterile slipper for the train and other slipper instrument for purifying legs.
All routines must be deleted.
This procedure requires hands and legs to the lotto in general for 2 to 6 minutes.
No need to lose the hand too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During the seat, the water from the grain should not be cut back to the hands.
After the finishing, the hands strike up a sterile skin and spend surgery.
To reduce the dissemination of mikrocarbons, you better put your hands or use the anticeptics for hands before and after the invasion of a sick person.
In order to combat stabil infections in hospitals, it was established that the most useful of the brain was the first 20 per cent of the brain, and that very few additional advantages were received when the brain speed was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Comparing with the skin of antibactrial milk, the skin of the ordinary meal leads to more than the tropical increase of bacterial infectious diseases that were transferred through food. The comparison of the hands of the spy-containing brake and the brain of the antibactrial mile at average 30 seconds of each procedure showed that the processing of the brake-upped braking has reduced bacterial pollution by 26% compared to the antibactrial mile.
However, milk and water are more effective than the brain dissolved for hands, in the plan of decreasing the number of H1N1 viruses, and the clustering of the difficil. Hygiene development activities in medical institutions can include the training of the brake personnel, the improvement of the access to spy-container cutting for hands, as well as the written and literal memories of personnel to disclose their hands.
Additional studies are needed on the most effective way of measures in different medical institutions.
In developing countries, the hands with milk have been acknowledged by economic effective and important means for improvement of health and even food.
However, the absence of stable water supply, milk or means for mushrooms in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to smell their hands regularly.
For example, most of the rural areas in Africa are not far in every private or public toilet, although there are low-powered ways to organize muscles in such places.
However, the lack of hands may also be caused by cutting additives, not for milk or water.
Promoting and stimulating milk hands may affect political decisions, enhance awareness of the use of the brain and bringing long-term changes in the conduct of the population.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and evaluation of results must be carried out.
In the systematic analysis, 70 studies have found that, in order to improve the situation of hygiene hands in countries with an average level of health and epidemic monitoring at the community level, the public market has been less effective, and one of the examples of promoting the motions in schools, the United Nations Child Fund, Triree Star Approach, which promotes the implementation of regular economic measures, stimulating students with us and the implementation of other geographical trends.
In order to comply with minimum standards, schools can increase their levels from one to three stars.
Manufacturers are one of the possible measures under the hygiene information campaigns to reduce disease and child mortality.
The World Day of Hands (Global Hand Washing Day) is another example of information campaign aimed at changed behavior.
In some studies, the general efficiency of hands in developing countries was considered in comparison with the DALYs indicator (conserved years of life without disability).
However, a study suggests that the stimulation of milk hands is a significantly more economic decision compared to other sanitary measures.
The importance of human health - especially for vulnerable groups such as young mothers or pregnant soldiers in hospitals was first recognized in the middle of the 19th century by two hygiene newsletters: the vengar doctor Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), the English nurses and the “principational invasion of hospitals”.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by lyrics called miasme.
In the 1980s, with regard to the disorders of food trace, and infections related to medical assistance, the United States control and prevention centres of diseases have been more actively promoting hygiene as an important measure to prevent infection.
As a result of the sugar grip in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have been better understood how important it was to move with milk to protect the body from such infectional diseases.
For example, in Germany, a closer to the public toilets, as well as in office buildings and airports, a warrant was discovered with “the right hand technicians”.
The expression “wipe hands” means expressing its desire to take responsibility for anything or to be a party.
It happens from the Bible, Matteus’s Gospel: Pontius Pilatus had “the hands of the hands ” when he decided to drink Jesus Christ, and then the expression was more widely used in some English communities.
In the McBeat's drink, Lady McBeat began to shoot his hands in an unforeseen temptation from the imagined folk, symbolized by unclean conscience, in respect of the crimes that she did, and struggled to make her husband.
It was also established that people who remembered or observed inethnic actions tended to smell their hands in comparison with other people and have more importance for them.
Also, less likely that people who have the opportunity to spend their hands after the view will participate in any other "purchasing" compensatory activities, such as voluntary activities.
In religions, the hands have both hygiene and symbolic meaning, the symbolic mosquito of water, but without milk, is part of the ritual prescribed in many religions, including bathism, hinduism, tevila and netilat in Judaism, the Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam.
Industism, Judaism and Islams prescribe the obligatory brain after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered the necessary brain before and after each receipt of food.
Productive control of COVID-19
The control of productivity factors in connection with COVID-19 underlines the use of the working and health methods for controlling the risk and combating coronavir 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk control of the workplace depends on the location and tasks of work, based on risk assessments, serious epidemic situations in the community and risk factors for individual employees that may be vulnerable in relation to COVID-19.
The Office of the United States for Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that workers with smaller risk have minimum professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and, in such cases, basic measures are required to combat infections, including hands, stimulation of workers to stay home at the signs of disease, compliance with the rescue and daily treatment and declination of work.
Medium risks require private or close contacts with persons who have no confirmed or suspected COVID diagnosis, but are likely to be inflicted with the present dissemination of diseases in society or during international travels.
Such categories may relate to employees contacting the public, such as schools, high-quality workers, and in some large slowly shops.
Risk control measures for such a group, including basic infection prevention measures, include transportation using high-efficient air filters, protected screens and availability of personnel protection for contact with the infections of COVID-19.
The OSHA believes that medical institutions and morgans contacted with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 are related to high risks; at that time, a higher risk increases in the conduct of such aerosol education procedures or the collection/processing of persons with a reliable diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk control measures for such staff include the use of engineering and technical security equipment, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, as well as personnel protection for the purpose.
COVID-19 can cause various effects on the workplace.
The workers may not be in the work place for their own diseases, the need for other persons or the fear of the possible infringement.
Common templates can be changed as regards the kinds of goods in question and the way to buy such goods (e.g., purchase purchases in short periods of delivery or service, not out of the machine).
Finally, it is possible to overcome goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. In the protection of the organization, it is possible to use the Epidemide Plan for Preparation and Response Measures.
The plans affect risk issues related to different workplaces and tasks, including the sources of infringement, the risk factors of home and communities, as well as the risk of individual employees, such as old age or chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the means of control to address such risks, as well as the plans of extreme activities for situations that may result in epidemia.
Plans for preparation for epidemia and responsibilities may be subject to the recommendations of the national level or state level.
Some of the goals for responding to epidemic measures: reduction in the dissemination of virus among staff, protection of people with higher risks of serious health complications, business maintenance and minimise negative consequences for other organizations in their targets.
Responsable measures affect serious diseases in the community where business is.
Risk control instruments are a structure that is widely used in the security and hygiene of work to group such means, depending on effectiveness.
In the absence of the risk of COVID-19, engineering and technical security are the most effective ones, then administrative measures and, finally, personnel protection.
Ingenitors and security means to exclude staff from the workplace of risks and are not believed in the conduct of the employee, which may be the most benefitous decision.
Administrative measures provide changes in labour policy or procedures required by employer or staff.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to eliminate certain risks.
All types of staff protection must be elected depending on the threats for the employee, depending on the size (e.g., rescueers) to be used regularly and appropriately, to be regularly checked, supported and replaced as necessary, as well as to be correct, clean and maintained or valided in avoiding infringement.
The Office of the United States for Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) believes that at least risk posts have minimum contact with the public and their colleagues.
Base measures to combat epidemia recommended for all workplaces include a frequent and careful hand, recommendation for disabled employees to remain home, compliance with the observer kitchen, including closure of the hands in the box and labour, ensuring the slaughter and containers, ready to be removed or changed, where necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid use of other instruments and equipment, and to carry out daily closing and defects of work.
Faster identification and exclusion of persons potentially infiltrated is a critical stage for the protection of workers, customers, visitors and other workers.
The United States Headquarters for Diseases and Protection (CDC) recommends staff to remain home to the end of the heat, the lack of the body and many other symptoms during at least 24 hours without use of cycling medications or other medications to eliminate symptoms, and also requires to ensure the hypothesis of hospital letters, to allow staff to stay home for the healthy members of the family and to make awareness of such policies.
According to the OSHA, a medium-level risk posts require private and close contacts to the distance is not more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons who have no confirmation of COVID or suspects, but are likely to have SARS-CoV-2 in respect of the dissemination of illness in the territory where business is, or with regard to recent travellings of such persons in the field of distribution of COV-19.
In these categories, employees with higher risk contact with publicity, such as schools, working with high quality of the population and some major degrees of technological shops.A technological security tools for such groups and groups are the installation of high-efficient air filters, the intensity of ventilation, the installation of physical barriers, such as the provisional plastic screens, and the intensity of the customer service without the exit of the automobile. Administrative measures for such groups and a higher risk include the advertising recommendation of the emerging urgement of your homes of anxiety of the emerging nervousness of the emerging nervousness of the urineness of the emerging of the ageing of the COW.
Employees from such a group may need a load of rescuerers in several cases.
If a person is sick in the airport, to ensure the safety of the employees and other passengers, it is necessary for measures such as the isolation of a sick person from other persons at a distance of 6 feet, the appointment of an escape member for a nursing person, or the provision of a sick mask or treatment of such a person, with a request to cover the smell and the mouth of the smell in the chair or injury.
Equipage members should take single medical principles close to a sick traveller or in association with physics or potentially infected surfaces, and may be additional personal protection means, if sick, regular skin, or difficult with breathing.
Used initials and other unilateral objects should be placed in a biological safe facility, and the infected surfaces should then be cleaned and decentralized. In cases of commercial ships, including rail rail and other passenger boards, the safety of travels in case of sickness, self-resolution and immediate information on the shipment centre is available in the juice or other symptoms.
In the idea, medical examination should be conducted in the isolated chain of such persons, and, in the case of schools and child-related institutions, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cutting or desinfecting if a person is in the school building, independence on the dissemination of diseases in the community.
When there is a minimum or medium level of dissemination of infections in the community, a social distance strategy may be introduced, for example, to eliminate the outcome of personal meetings, meetings and other mass events such as physical or cold drink, feeding in cafeteria, increased distance between parties, time-related and entry regulation, restriction of individual health institutions, use of individual health institutions for children's symptoms.
At significant levels of dissemination in the local community, including social distance strategies, they may be considered to be low, in view of CDC, for law enforcement officials who carry out daily duties, a direct risk for health.
The law enforcement officers, who are responsible for contacting persons with a confirmed diagnose or suspected COVID-19, are recommended to follow the same instructions as those prescribed by firms for rapid assistance, including the use of appropriate personnel protection.
When closely contacts with employees during delay, they must purify and deficit their formal rings and equipment to re-use by means of cleaning airlines or by contrary, comply with standard operation procedures for preventing diseases and identification of personal protection, as well as the use and strike of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and maritime workers are subject to high or very high risks.
High risks are staff for medical assistance, support, laboratory personnel and medical transport contacted with patients with confirmed diagnosis or prefered COVID invasion.
They have a very high risk of infringement in the aerosol education procedures or by collecting/procesing tests from persons with a reliable diagnosis or preferable COVID.
The aerosol education procedures relate to condensation, cash procedures, brochure, some standardological procedures and investigations or collecting invasive methods.
Morg employees with high risks are personnel who have been treated by the body of persons with confirmed diseases or suspects of COVID-19 at their death; if such staff are discovered, they are in a very high-risk category. Additional technological security means for such groups include the use of isolated places for patients with reliable diseases or undertakings in COVID-19, including the procedures for education.
In some health and morgue institutions, special ventilation can be used with negative pressure.
The tests should be conducted in compliance with the precautions for biological security levels 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends to distribute patients in the displaced areas of expectation, depending on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protection means, OSHA recommends to use workers who are interconnecting to 6 feet (6 feet) with patients with confirmed diseases or suspicion for the SARS-CoV-2 arrest, as well as to persons who are conducting aware education.
In the United States, NIOSH filters or higher classes have to be used in a comprehensive written recording programme for guard protection, which indicates the requirements for individual use and medical reviews.
Other types of monitoring may provide more effective protection and competence for staff, and WHO does not recommend the use of speciality because COVID-19 is a redistributory disease, not through physics.
WHO recommends to use only surgical masks for a personnel who acts on the receipt of patients.
Learns who gathered images from the daily way to patients with COVID-19 or translators without procedures for aerosol education recommended to carry out surgical mask, protected bones or protected screens for persons, heat and primary.
In the course of the aerosol education procedures, instead of the surgical mask, the N95 or FFP2 reservoir should be carried out.
In view of the lack of personal protection in the world, the WHO recommends that the needs in such means be minimised by the use of distance medical, physical barriers, such provisional cranks, the access to the patient infected by COVID-19, only those who provide direct remedies, only the personal protection means necessary for a specific task, the continuous use of one and the same reservoir, not known, with a number of patients with a single diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of staff protection targets and recommendations.

ANNEXE: CC0: Protected rights are not
In this month, we live in uncertain circumstances.
COVID-19 episode is the revelation of the light on the interrelated relationship between the world and our responsibility towards each other.
We had no precedence of such problems, but we know that our effectiveness depends on the ability to conscious, cooperate and develop communities throughout the world, which is based on such an organization.
We have observed partnership and careful relationships between all our colleagues, which reflected in electronic receptions, calls and pieces, a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, happily, we work surprising people.
I'm very grateful and proud to talk about you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed about the high evaluation of our work.
I recall how important it is for the world to call Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resources.
This is possible by your work, whether you are able to ensure the workability of our colleagues or the security of the communities.
The world needs information submitted to Wikipedia, and today it is more important than ever before.
At that time, to achieve significant results for the world, it is not only what we do, but also what we do.
With regard to the importance of such mission and your role in this process, we will make significant changes in the arrangement of our joint work by starting the next week.
Adjustment of our work and graphics
As Robin was previously said, the c-team team was gathered tonight to discuss our approach and graphics at the next days and months.
We have considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure sustainable organization in that period.
Most of us wanted to remove the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to leave, let it be.
For all staff, contractors and extraordinary staff:
On our expectations, there is a need to work about 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week before the post post posts.
We do not declare the weekends: if you can normally work for more hours, this will be allowed for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now; whatever your needs are, whether you care for the family, obtain food products, or if you get to the doctor, your welfare is our priority number one.
We're not following your work time.
If you're sick, you should not work.
It's comprehensive and incomprehensive, but we're talking about it.
It is not necessary to format a hospital letter or reply: simply inform your leader and help the command to look at the calendar and graphics to cover key areas.
(If you have a confirmed COVID diagnosis, report Brian from the T&C Ops unit so that T and C can support and take care of the guideline to your situation.)
The payment of temporary rates will be performed in full.
We have already declared and reaffirmed our intention to comply with our contractors and staff with the timely payment rate.
Each person will receive payment in accordance with the ordinary temporary rates used in normal circumstances.
This, in particular, reflects the period of disease when you can't work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use their work in a way to make peace around us.
What we do can bring wonderful results, especially in such times.
And again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with our leader to know what to expect, and to be able to adjust their actions accordingly.
Some kinds of work are considered significant.
Such activities should always be supported.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and Fundation commands (e.g. other) are critically important to need additional support.
We launch the process for all units to assess the current objectives and raises the focus on support, which is very important for our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we just focus on the most important projects.
Today ' s delay does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We are not planning to work “two more to turn back” after the end of the pandemic.
You do not need to work above to comply with unreal deadlines for the present time.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will work in order to set up new goals and deadlines as possible.
What happens with the APP (annual plans)?
To make a new reality and expectation of daily worktime, we intend to adjust the period of implementation of our Year Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose the proliferation of the terms for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for the budget, which allows staff to give critical priority to the work, self-related and relief of the closest work, and in all those who need or who want to work will ensure a decreased graph for a few weeks later.
This extendment allows significantly to reduce the current load of planning and pressure on all organizations.
In the next week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, to the representatives and teams of the information on the following steps immediately after acknowledgement.
Thanks to the ACP team for the leading role in this work.
Status of offices, risks and disposal
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected by the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to the number of warning measures, we took the anti-virus team to determine all surfaces in the office in San Francisco.
They used anti-virus decisions of the medical class for detection of all surfaces, as well as for accepted and lifted calves that can be accessed to our stage.
The building shall apply its own rules for cautiousness with the use of products to ensure safety of their ardenators.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in Colombia (DC) is on the WeWork company network, which has shared with us and all staff in DC, its rules related to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in Colombia was fully moved to the removal work in accordance with the indications made in San Francisco.
As we know some of our colleagues from New York, we also discussed the issue of the location in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be dismissed.
Some of our colleagues first work away.
Our elderly colleagues who work away know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to two hours.
In the need for more long sessions, consider the possibility of dispatching them for a few days.
Determine clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and develop materials for expertise.
Default use video connections to facilitate interactions and connections, such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For the goods, designate a coordinator — a person who will monitor the deal of questions in the chat and control the list of spyers, as well as the note-responsibilities (or joint packing).
If necessary, select technical email support if you need.
Use your advantages of the Wellness Reimbursment program when purchasing the shopping.
Keep connecting to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to our colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying the allergomic guidelines available in the web format to promote the efficiency of the distributed work on the whole organization.
Last week, we requested all recipients of the community to cancelle the mass activities financed by Wikimedia, such as 'editors', until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We understand and inform that our requests for such cancellation and other restrictions may affect the unfavourable implementation of agreed grants, and no one will be affected by the delay or change of such purposes.
The next week, we will take follow-up to WikiLeaks and other regional and thematic conferences of the Community.
The global community is not only an interruption of work, but also some feelings of facilitation in relation to mutual understanding and opportunity to concentrate on its own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
With regard to the perspective, CRT works on pages in Meta-Wiki, which provides space for the community to monitor the impact and society.
We remain in relation to COVID-related issues (19
We will send an invitation to your calendar to the Special Meeting on Friday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we use the opportunity to share further information, respond to your questions and to carry out time together with each other.
We are together in this situation and are ready to help all of us.
You can still receive information from such e-mail, and other important information on COVID-19 from the Wikipedia Office.
The CRT will update these pages, and all the information will be gathered in one place.
We are also working to maintain a regular communication with a personnel living in countries that have significantly affected the current situation.
In the case of travel, activities, key flows, information-release problems, or other assistance to the CRT.
We are willing to support and safeguard contacts as necessary.
If there are problems related to confidentiality, please contact Brian Judan (Bryan Judan), director of HR International Global Operations.
No such changes should be considered as refusal of our work and our obligations.
Subsequently, it is the recognition of the existing need for a new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to ensure the possibility of continued work in order to support our movement and worldwide through the necessary service.
Our planning work will be waiting for the appropriate time.
Today is time to support each other and to create a space for the important work coming in the future weeks and, perhaps, months.
To do this, we need each of you to help, and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families, and to work with the maximum departure as there is only a need.
Now, please, help your hands and don't care about your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Antiothensin 2 (ACE2) is a grain for external surface (cellular membranes) cells in light, artry, heart, shocks and cups.
ACE2 opposes the activeness of the corresponding angiotensin (ACE), the reduction of angiotensic II content and increased Ang (1-7), by making it a lot of promised decisions to treat heart-socialist diseases. AC2 also serves a cell input point for some coronavirs.
The human version of the farming is often mentioned as hACE2.
Angiotensic pharmaceutical grain 2 is a cycling metal that is located on the surface of endotelial and other cells.
The ACE2 Brack contains the N-commerced domain M2 and the P-commerce transport domain of the rain aminocystal collection.
ACE2 consists of an unilateral memorandum type I, its specimenally active domain is on the surface of light cells and other tissue.
The Included Domain ACE2 is excluded from the transemplary domain of another specimen known as shoes, and the slaughtered white is released in the blood skin and, finally, the skin is released.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is established to the cell membrane of most of the alveolary cells type II, the thickness of the tube, the artificial and ventricular cells and the heat cells of the majority of organs.
Biosintesis ACE2 and RNK are also found in the main corner of the brain, stritatum, hypotalamus and brain cream.
The basic function of ACE2 is to speak as an ACE contrary.
ACE covers the hormone of angiotensin I in the co-conciliating angiotensin II.
ACE2 decreases carboxyl-contamination of fenilalanin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it in the vasodilatric angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cover several other peptides, including [des-Arg9] - breadicine, appeline, neurotensine, dinorphine A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the member transporter of neutral aminoxis SLC6A19 and presents Hartnupa's disease.
As a transmimber white, ACE2 is the main point of input for some coronavirs, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS) virus; and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
Nevertheless, the linking of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 whites with a pharmaceutical domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cell leads to endocytosis and translocation as well as the endosome farmer within the cell.
The income process also requires a S-Serial protease of TMPRSS2, which is currently studied as a potential terrorist instrument, and some thoughts that the reduction of the ACE2 level in cells can help to combat infection.
However, many professional communities and regulatory bodies recommend that the standard therapy of APF and BRACs continue.
According to the systematic review and metabolism published on 11 July 2012, "the use of APF inhibitors was related to a significant reduction of the powder risk in 34 per cent compared to the control group".
Furthermore, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients receiving APF inhibitors who have been subjected to higher risks, pneumonia diseases, especially insults and heart inadequate.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with the decrease of pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than patients with general risks of pneumonia.”
The recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is the newness in therapy when heavy damages, and it seems to be improved in light hemodynamics and oxygen populations, involving the symptoms of respiratory insufficiency caused by lipopolisharids.
The rhACE2 period is about 10 hours in persons, and the start of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the continuity of the effects at 24 hours.
Some data show that rhACE2 can be a multi-promising means for people with the non-relatedity of the retina-angiotensic indicators (CPIs) or in diseases that have increased circle angiotensic II. The rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical tests in the treatment of a random respirator disorder.
COVID-19 applies are the program applications for mobile phones designed to help epidemiological investigation in the 2019-20 context of the coronavirus panodemia, namely the identification of persons (contacts), which could be contacted with the individual.
Some regions have been developed or proposed many of the applications of official supported authorities.
A number of applications were developed to monitor contacts.
This has generated a debate on confidentiality issues, especially on the systems based on the monitoring of the geographical position of users of the applications.
More flexible options include the use of Bluetooth signals to register user close to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that their efforts to integrate such applications were linked directly to their Android and IOS operational systems.
In China, the Government launched a annex that allows citizens to check whether they had been communicated with people infected by COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, which are used in Singapore as TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be transmitted to the Government, and the North Macedonia launched the Appendix “StopKorona!”, which works at Bluetooth to monitor contacts with potentially infected people and provides operational contact with health bodies.
The Annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
At 14 April 2020, the annex was expected to register in Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the annex to monitor contacts is at the final stage of development and will be available for deployment within a few weeks, and that similar applications are planned to start in Ireland and France.
Australia and New Zealand consider the possibility of use of applications based on the Singapore Application TraceTogether and the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia intends to use an application with geo-onization functions, which aims to follow patients with COVID-19 diagnosis in Moscow not to leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Profesor for Security Safety, the University of Cambridge, defines a number of potential practical problems that can be faced with applications, including false processing and potential inefficiency in the use of the application only a small part of the population.
In view of the concerns about the dissemination of the misconduct or harmful “cononavir” annexes, Apple was limited to the list of organizations that may propose its applications related to the coronavir in App Store, including only the “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon also set similar limitations.
Participants expressed concern about the consequences of the population's oversight by the applications related to the coronavirus; in particular, the question of the demographic monitoring infrastructure established to combat the pandemic of the coronavirus when the threat disappeared.
The International Amnesty Organization and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such supervision.
The Organization has announced eight conditions which were made to the Government projects:
Monitoring must be “lawful, necessary and comparable”;
Monitoring and monitoring should be enabled by the restrictions of the duration of action;
Data should be limited to the purposes of combating COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity must be protected, and evidence of such protection should be provided;
Digital monitoring should exclude cases of discrimination and marginalisation;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined at the level of legislation;
Protection against abuse should be ensured, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Without Borders) also published its lists of conditions.
Google and Apple propose their joint plan to address a permanent monitoring problem, aimed at eliminating the monitoring mechanism from the operational systems of their devices, just as the need to disappear.
In some countries, the network monitoring of locations is used instead of loading the applications and the possibility of avoiding monitoring.
The network was accepted in Israel.
Network decisions that have access to location data also have major confidential problems.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of systems have been developed with the conservation of confidentialities that are used only for connection (see section below).
In South Korea, it was used a system that was not used as a basis for monitoring contacts.
Instead of using the special annex, the system has collected information on monitoring from different sources, including monitoring of mobile devices and card transactions, and then united them to establish notifications in the form of text communications that were potentially infected.
The Government has not only used this information to prevent citizens of potential contacts with the individuals, but also provided information on the location of a general available place, which has been possible because of significant changes in the information protection law which had been made after the MRS in this country.
Access to such information can be available through several applications and websites, including Germany, the use of centralized systems and confidential systems.
To 6 April 2020, the details were not yet accumulated.
The follow-up of contacts with confidentiality is a substantial concept, a significant number of research literatures dated at the minimum of 2013. For 7 April 2020, more than ten experts were working on decisions on confidentiality, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register user approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEP-PT is a product of coordinated efforts including centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentrated trases with the conservation of confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN) protocols for confidentiality, mobile contact mechanisms (ACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for never abandoning the personal data and all comparisons.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is the development of SafePaths, a platform that ensures the conservation of confidentiality in the collection and use of data on location or transfer of ways to monitor the distribution of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the studies set out in the Apps Gone Rogue document (Apps Gone: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an epidemic): as to maintain confidentiality during the epidemic), published in March 2020, the second similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, company designing confidential technologies, which was also originally based on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable machinery technologies that allow users to exchange confidential data on location and health status with other users and officials, with no risk of confidence.
On 5 April 2020, groups divided the same approach and similar protocols were based on the global coalition of NGOs, which aims to reduce fractions and to ensure the global cohesion of applications to monitor and publicize, which is the key factor of their broad distribution.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore Government announced that it was opened by the BlueTrace code used for its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies controlling the work of Android and IOS mobile platforms, have announced the initiative to monitor contacts, which they claimed to ensure confidentiality, and which is based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that allows to maintain confidentiality.
They also published key technologies used in the work of the system.
The Apple and Google data shows that the system should be circulated in three stages:
Developing instruments allowing Governments to establish official applications to monitor the movement of the infiltred coronavirus by the citizens, but maintaining confidential data
The integration of this functioned directly in iOS and Android, Google and Apple plans to solve permanent monitoring problems, first entering the system through the update of the operational system, and then removed it so after the disappearance of the threat.
The reposition of the medicine (as well known as reproducing, readministration, change of the task or the therapy transmission) is the re-profit of the approved medicine to the treatment of disease or medical condition that is different from the disease, which is used in the development.
This is one of the research guidelines that are currently used to develop safe and effective COVID treatment methods.
Other research guidelines include the development of vaccines from COVID-19 and the transmission of re-concentrated plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 tanks that have the effect of medicines, each of which has a number of ligade-related parts.
The analysis of these linked areas is an approaching basis for the development of an effective anti-virus preparation against COVID vessels.
The most important white-measures for SARS-CoV-2 are the pophaine-protease, the CNC-Depending RN-Polymiers, the helitar, the S and the ADF-riboosfatase.
Hussein AA and co-actors studied a number of candidates that then were optimized and analyzed their structures with the most appropriate preparations to accelerate the development of high effective preparation against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical research.
Chlorokine is an antimotherary preparation, which is also used in the treatment of some audiomune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that hydroxycrokine and associated with it would enter the number of four preparations investigated under the clinical “Slidarity” test.
The Governor of New York Andrew Kumoo announced that the tests of cloroxine and hydrochlorokine were started in New York State on 24 March. On 28 March FDA authorized the use of hydrochlorogen sulphate and chlorokin fosfate in accordance with extreme application permit (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not accepted during the clinical FDA test process and was authorized in accordance with the United States only as an experimental treatment for immediate assistance in patients who were hosted but cannot receive clinical test treatment.
CDC stated that “Hydroxylochlorokin use, control or duration is not yet installed for proliferation or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.”
The doctors say they use the prepatriation when "no other way out".
The Turkeyn research group in Istanbul conducted a small study on the use of clorocine in combination with cine and vitamins A, C and D.
Degree-based studies are conducted at the University of Duke and the University of Oxford.
The New York University Medical School studys the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydrochlorokine.
Chinese clinical tests in Uhana and Shanghaine showed that fabrics were “unlike effects.”
35 patients in Shanjjen, who received this prepair, were negatively obtained in average 4 days, while 45 patients who did not take prepair, 11 days of illness.
In Uhana, a study was conducted with a large oversight of 240 patients with pneumonia, one half of which received favipiral, and the second half of the virus.
The Italian Pharmaceutical State recalled the public that the results of the effectiveness of preparation should not be considered to be final.

According to the South China Morning Post newspaper, Sindzo Abe reported the Trampa Administration about the possibilities of purchase, which may be less effective in cases of disease.
It may be un dangerous for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to deteriorate.
As a result of a study, the combination of antivirus “lopperavir” and “ritonavir” (Caletra), was concluded that “the effectiveness of the use of preparations has not been identified.”
The preparations were designed to inhibit HIV replication through anti-protease connections.
The group of researchers from the University of Colombia is trying to modify medicines to find connection with SARS-CoV-2 protease, which criticizes the re-proliferation of drugs that have been particularly developed for HIV and AIDS.
WHO included the combination of colonavir and ritonavir in the international test “Slidarity”.
Remdesivir has been created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola and the Marshall Virus infections, and then the Gilead Sciences officials found that the rhinovir has an anti-viral activity in the vitro regarding the multitude of fil, pneumonia, paramics and coronavirs.
One of the problems related to anti-viral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and transmissions.
Some early preliminary studies show that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and there are several clinical tests, including two university clinics Climberland; one is conducted in patients with dead forms of disease, and another in patients with more serious forms.
There are currently three clinical tests for internal input of Vitamin C for persons who are hosted with a serious form of COVID-19: two plasma control studies (China, Canada) and one without use of plasma (Italia).

Some antibiotics that were recognised potentially to use as COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilizinumb ( anti-IL-6): approved in China.
Also tests in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab #COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetic vaccine against coronavir 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite any vaccine tests, many attempts to develop such vaccine continue to be undertaken.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 could be obtained before 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were investigated for security phase I.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, the great increase of this disease has been distributed throughout the world, resulting in significant investments in the development of vaccine and research activities in its connection.
Many organizations for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are used by public genes.
As stated in April, the key tasks of the CEPI in the development of vaccine initiatives are to ensure the necessary speed, production powers, increased development and global access.
In April, the scientists reported that there were 10 different technological platforms for creating effective vaccine against COVID-19 at the beginning of 2020.
Some main platform objectives included in the security study of phase I:
nuclein oxygen (DNC and RNK) (developer of phase I and vaccine preparatory: modern, and 1273)
Virus vector (developer I and vaccine prepaid: CanSino Biologicals, adenviral vector type 5)
As scientists reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are on early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79 of the Millennium Institute); further 37 candidates were declared, but there are little general information available (possitively on planning or development).
The preliminary testing for safety and immunity is at stages I-II, normally predominantly controlled, and on a number of parts, with a timely definition of more accurate and effective forests.
The phase III of the tests usually covers more participants, including the supervisory group; at this stage the preparation is tested at the effectiveness of prevention of diseases and at the same time monitors the adverse effects of optimum injury.
From 79 vaccine candidates actively developed (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020) 74 have not been tested on humans (these are still at the stage of the productive studies).

At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of 275 million Canadian dollars for the financing of 96 research projects on medical anti-COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
At the same time, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of 192 million Canadian dollars specially for the development of vaccines against COVID-19, as well as the plans for the establishment of the National Vacuum Bank, where a number of new vaccines could be used in the case of the new injury of the coronavirus.
In April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of the Medicine of Pittsburgh reported on the testing of PittCoVacc, the possible vaccine against COVID-19 on the mouse, said that “MNA introduced joint vaccines of SARS-CoV-2 S1, causing strong antigen-specific anti-synthesis [in museum] that had been identified through 2 weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canada Pharmaceutical School of Waterloo announced the development of potential vaccine based on DNA, which may be released in the form of a national degree.
The DNA bacteria will grow in human bacteria and form without dangerous viral parts that can stimulate immune anti-terrorism processing against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, the Industry and three United States University combined IBM supercomputer resources in combination with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google area calculations.
Some vaccines have geographic effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages, in addition to the provision of diseases.
Another earlyly identified study in Australia contains 4170 health workers.
Developed vaccines may be safe or unefficient.
The initial studies on the evaluation of vaccine effectiveness with the use of animal models, such as the ACE2-training muscles, other animals and low-standard laboratorys, indicate the need for measures to maintain biosafety 3 in the processing of live viruses, as well as international coordination for standardized security procedures.
Vacuum against SARS and MERS was protested in animal models.
In 2020, there are no drugs or protected vaccines that would be safe and effective for people.
According to the research work published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and physicians for the treatment of typical pneumonia was priority for governments and public health institutions throughout the world.
When the MRS was spread, it was considered that the SARS study, which was at that time, could be a standard for the development of vaccine and the therapeutic means against MERS-CoV infection.
On March 2020 there was one (based on DNA) vaccine from MERS, which passed in the first phase of the clinical tests in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were vaccines based on the virus vector and were in the process of development, two addenavirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one (MVA-MERS-S).
The controversial theory was distributed in social networks, claiming that COVID-19 is not all new, and that vaccine already exists.
Publications in social networks quoted some patients who claimed that the existence of patents to the genetic symptoms of other coronavirs, such as SARS coronavirus, and vaccine for these stamps.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is infected by a heavy respirator syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The worst diversity of symptoms include disaster, cash and breathing.
Other symptoms may include feelings of illness, muscle pain, diarrhoe, pain in the wolf, disorder and pain in the animal.
The first symptoms of disease are usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most of the cases have been demonstrated by light symptoms, but in some cases the disease is in viral pneumonia and polyorganic inadequacy.
At 17 April 2020, more than 2,24 million cases of invasion in 210 countries and regions were registered, and over 153.000 people died from this disease.
More than 5680,000 people have been reservoired, and the virus is mainly distributed in close contact with people, often through microscopic cables that are in air at the box, injury or conversation.
Although these caps are formed at the outlet, they are usually threatened by the earth or on the surface but are not transferred through the air on large distances.
People are also impressed as regards polluting surfaces, and then their eyes, noises or rats.
The surface of the virus can live within 72 hours.
It is the first three days after the symptoms, although its dissemination may be possible before symptoms and later stages. The standard diagnosis method is a polymerical reaction of re-reaction in real time (RT-PCR) to be taken as a smooth of smoke.
The use of medical mass is recommended to patients with illness suspicion, as well as those who care for them.
Recommendations on the use of health mass are different: some states recommend that they do not use, some recommend their use, and others require it.
There are no vaccine or specific treatment from the virus of COVID-19.
Local dissemination of disease was registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Individed persons may have no symptoms or symptoms of grip, such as slipper, cash, slowness and eye.
Extreme symptoms include difficult respiration, continuous pain or feeling of consciousness, consciousness, difficulties with trial, disruption of persons or smells; if there are above-mentioned symptoms, it should be immediately called for medical assistance.
The symptoms of higher respiratory ways, such as breathing, smuggling, or pain in the wolf, may be observed.
Also, in different percentages, weak-sized symptoms such as tosnote, routine and diarree are observed.
Some of the diseases registered in China were marked only in the sense of grain and heart-training.
In some cases illness can be progressed by developing in pneumonia, polior inadequateness, and finally death comes to death.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may be between 2 and 14 days.
97.5 per cent of the symptoms are starting to be demonstrated within 11,5 days after the invasion, and the symptoms are not shown in all data.
The role of such unsymmetric mediars in transmission of disease is still fully unknown, but the preliminary information shows that they can contribute to dissemination of infections.
The percentage of persons who had an insynthmic period of disease is currently unknown, and the Korean Control and Prevention Centres (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all cases and hospitalizations on virus during the disease was unsympathized.
The National Health Commission of China began to include unhypothetic cases in its daily report from 1 April; from 166 cases of the infringement registered on that day, 130 (78 per cent) was rejected in symptoms at the time of testing.
And a molecule, and a bleeding can have a large concentration of virus.
In the hole, the air speaks more caps than the normal sound.
The study carried out in Singapore showed that the cover can be distributed at a distance of 4,5 meters (15 feet).
Virus is not generally transferred to air, but the National Science Academy suggested that the transmission of a bioaeconomic virus is still possible, and the testing of the air processed by air collectors in the cords of people's rooms showed the existence of the virus RNC.
Some medical procedures, such as intimulation and heart-ly-life reaction (LLL), may lead to the distribution of extraction products and, therefore, to disseminate the virus in the air.
There are also fears that virus can be distributed through fece, but this risk is considered low, and virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the dissemination of virus may also be even before symptoms, but the risk is small.
The European Centre for Prevention and Diseases (ECDC) workers say that it is not very clear that the virus is easier, however, knows that one sick usually affects 2 to 3 other persons. Virus can survive from a few hours to a few days.
In particular, it was found that on the carton surface, the virus can live during one day, on the plastic surface (polipiline) and on the nervous (IASI 304) — to three days and 99 per cent of the medical surfaces — 4 hours.
However, these indicators are depending on the power and temperature.
The fat and my means in their proper use have a very useful effect in the fighting of the impression: the mile destroys the grass protected glass of virus, deactivating it in such a way, and it can be removed from the skin surfaces and other surfaces.
Other deficiencies, such as banalchloride and glucoon chloride (chirurgic deficiency), were less effectively against the virus, and in the studies carried out in Hongkong, the samples were taken in average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the first six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of virus in blood, and the sixth patient has been identified in the second day of testing.
The rare replicator syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe coronavirus syndrome, in the first three persons found in a pneumonia from an oriental respiratory group registered in Uhana.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in the colonial nature.
Without human body, virus is destroyed by a brain milk that covers its protected shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
The legkey is the most substantial organ of COVID-19 because virus is in the cells through angiotensin 2 (ACE2), which is most distributed in the alveolial cells of light type II.
The virus is connected to ACE2 and passes in a cell using the character of the surface-protein-chip (pilomer).
12 per cent of the individuals in Uhana have been diagnosed by a microarm injury that is more often seen in a serious form of disease.
The rate of heart-consistent symptoms is high due to the system recurrence and the violations of the immune system in the progress of disease, but the illness of microcarbon damage may also be related to the existence of ACE2 receptors in heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in large numbers since they participate in the work of the body.
The high rate of transbosis (31 per cent) and venus transbobola (25 per cent) observed in patients with COVID-19, and may be shown unfortunate predictions. The audience of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the existing diffusal alvolar damages (DAD) and limfocyto-assistant in lightly.
Despite SARS-COV-2, the symptoms of system hypersensitive hypersensitive system are observed in spite of the SARS-COV-2.
In particular, it was identified that the pathogical GM-CSF T cells correlated with the replication of IL-6 monocytes and the heavy pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Limfocitar filters were also found during the hiding.
WHO also published several test protocols on this disease.
Polymeric cep reaction in real time mode (RT-CPR) is a standard testing method.
The test is generally conducted on specimens received by a snake, but can also be used by a snake or a snake.
The results are usually ready for a few hours to two days.
Blood analysis may also be taken by brothers, but they require two tests of blood that have been taken in two weeks, and their results have no immediate value.
The Chinese scientist could set up a coronavir and publish its genetic symptoms so that scientists in the world's laboratorys could self-develop tests of polymeric cep reaction methods (CPP) to identify the existence of this virus.
As at 4 April 2020, anti-corps tests that could be identified at the current time, as well as the fact of the possible infringement in the past were being developed in the stage of development, but have not yet received a wide dissemination.
China's experience of test results showed that their accuracy is 60-70 per cent.
On March 21, 2020, the Office for Food Control of Quality and Medical Products (FDA) adopted the first test for the diagnosis on place, allowed it to be used at the end of the month, in indications on the diagnosis published by the Johnn University of U.S.A., the infection methods are defined on the basis of clinical characteristics and epidemic risks.
Multiplele subparameters of the type "Matex Steel" with peripheral, asymmetric and asymmetric distribution are part of the symptoms identified at the early stage of disease.
Subsectional domination, the symptoms of a bowl strip (from detection of repayment with changing alveol) and the consolidation is developed in the progress of disease.
There are few data on microscopic impacts and patophysology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological research carried out when closing:
Macroscopians: trib, percardite, infringement and leakage
You can see four types of viral pneumonia:
Little pneumonia: light, hyperplasis of pneumonites, large typical pneumonics, inter-related infrastructure and multi-day guigan cells
Heavy form of pneumonia: diffused alveolar damage (DAD) with diffusional vessel extraction.
The DAD is the cause of a delicate syndrome distraction (ORDS) and heavy hypothemia.
Pneumonia: the organization of exhibitors in alveolar flights and the medicational fibros.
Blood: diffused internal skin (DVS syndrome); lycoethylelatic reaction
Preventional measures to reduce the possibility of infringement include home staying, avoiding human places, often handling with milk and water within at least 20 seconds, compliance with the slight hygiene rules, and avoiding slightness to the eyes, feet or skin.
CDC recommends to close the mouth and the smell of the smell or smell or, in the absence of the silver, to close the mouth and the inner side of the hand area.
It is recommended that a quality hygiene procedure should be carried out after the box or shock.
The Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) recommends the use of tissues in public places, in particular to restrict the transfer of infections by persons with unhypothetic diseases; social distance strategy is aimed at reduced contact with large people's groups; within these measures schools and enterprises were closed, citizens movement limits and large public activities.
Recommendations on distance also suggest that people should be at least 6 feet (1,8 m) each other.
There is no tested COVID-efficacy preparations. Since vaccine development is expected before 2021, the main part of the measures against dissemination of COVID-19 constitutes a reduction in the epidemic pipe known as “payment exit”.
The CDC also recommends that hands with milk and water beat at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet, or with a strong contamination of hands, as well as before the food and after the disappointment, boxe or smell.
CDC also recommends the use of a dismissing sphere (approximately 60%) for hand processing but only when milk and water is not available. In regions where such deficiencies are not sold, WHO provides two receptives for local production.
These compositions are used by the stain or ispropanol with antimicrobic activity.
The switch of water is used to eliminate bacterial sphere and is not a suitable means for handing anti-septic processing.
The guiceral is added as a owner.
Patients are shown supporting therapy, which can include infusional treatment, oxygen support, and support of other inflicted vital organs.
CDC recommends those suspected that virus is infiltrated to bring usual medical mass.
Extra corporal oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory inadequacy, but its advantages are still being studied.
In order to strengthen immunity, it is recommended to comply with the rules of personal hygiene, healthy life and dial.
Supporting therapy methods may be shown to patients with easy symptoms at the early stages of disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the invasion of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive therapy and polmonology have promoted the therapeutic recommendations of various IBCC.
No specific treatment of COVID-19 is available at April 2020.
To treat symptoms as the first line, some medical employees recommend to make choices for paracetamore (acetaminofen) compared to ibuprofen.
In implementing procedures for air-capital emissions, such as intuination or hands, it is necessary to take warning measures to minimise the risk of transmission of virus, especially in medical institutions.
Medical workers with COVID-19 recommended that the aircraft (IAIR) be placed in an air-capital isolator (AIIR) as an additional measure, in addition to standard precautions for contact and air. CDC has published the recommendations for the use of individual protection (ICS) during the pandemic.
Recommendated personal protection means: protected heavy, brain or medical mask, eye protection and medical primates.
N95 reviewers are allowed to be used in industrial conditions, but FDA has allowed the use of these receptors in accordance with the extreme application permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect parts from air, such as powder, but not guaranteed in the use of an effectiveness for the protection of the special biological agent.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends to use protected persons' screens or, at least, prepare masks in home conditions.
In most cases, COVID-19 is insufficiently hard to require the art ventilation of light or its alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of monitoring support for hospitalized patients with a respiratory inadequacy related to COVID-19 is currently actively studied, and there are some evidence that interruptions can be avoided using a oxygen cancer with a intensive air flow or a double-scale pression in diet ways.
Before not known, whether there is one of these two ways for patients in critical states as effective as IHL.
Some doctors choose for the invasive mechanical ventilation of light, if available, because this is significantly limited to the dissemination of parts in the air compared to the incremental air flow.
In many developing countries, there is no need to be malnutrition in hospitality, and health resources are too limited to increase the number of cases of COVID-19 in a serious form of hospitalization.
As a result of a study carried out in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive therapy office, 2.3 per cent was required in the mechanical support of light ventilation work, and 1.4 per cent had ended.
About 30 per cent of the people hosted by COVID-19 in China, finally, have been realized.
The work to ensure the art ventilation of lights is complicated because the strict respirator syndrome (ARDS), the development of COVID-19, and oxygen is increasingly enhanced.
IDP, with the support of skin pressure and SDC, is required to deliver the maximum number of oxygen in light and to ensure the minimum damages of ventilation, resulting in which the pneumotor can be deployed.
In the early models, higher ventlers can not be available.
The survey of potential treatment methods began in January 2020, and there are some anti-virus tests at this time.
The worst perspective is the render.
The development of new medicines may extend until 2021, but some of the tested preparations have already been approved for other purposes or are at the last stages.
Preventional preparations can be tested on patients with severe forms of disease.
The recommended WHO volunteers participate in tests of effectiveness and security of potential treatment. FDA provided an interim authorisation to use a recovery plasma as an experimental treatment when human life threatens serious or direct risks.
It was not implemented in clinical studies that should be carried out to prove security and effective treatment methods.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application for the fight against disease.
For the entry, users should enter their name and identification number.
The application can find “prominent contact” using monitoring data and, therefore, determine the potential risk of infringement.
Each user may also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is found, the application recommends not only self-resolution but also the notification to local health bodies; the analysis of the large data collected with mobile phones, the recognition of persons, the monitoring of mobile phones and the art intellect, are used to monitor intelligent people and those contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed the security bodies to monitor the data of the mobile phones of persons who are presumably infected by the coronavirus.
Measures were taken to ensure the carnaval and protection for persons who could be contacted with the invalid citizens.
In March 2020, the German Telekom Virus also provided a study and prevention to the federal government institutions of Germany and the Robert Coha Institute, aggregated information on the location of hundreds of actors.
In Russia, the recognition of persons has been introduced in order to identify the carnaval offenders.
The Regional Health Auditor, Italy, reported that the operators of hundreds of networks report that “40 per cent of people are still moved to the territory”.
The German Government has conducted a 48-time programing marsh for weekly days, with more than 42,000 participants.
The Chairman of Estonia Kerty Calulayd also called for creative decisions against the dissemination of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress regarding carrantine, travel restrictions, treatment effects or fear of the infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor's words: “Increased social isolation, unity, health concerns, stress and economic falls, perfect conditions for harming mental health and welfare of people”.
Diseases may be easy with low or unexpected symptoms that remind other general respiratory diseases, such as ordinary simplicity.
Patients with a simple form of disease are normally in two weeks while the treatment of patients with heavy or critical forms may require from three to six weeks.
Employed women may have a higher risk of receiving a heavy form of COVID-19 based on data on other virus such as SARS and MERS, although there is no COVID-19 data.
In persons with the most hardest illness of COVID-19 may rapidly progress in a strict respirator syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory inadequacy, septic shock or polio-deficiency.
COVID-19 complications include sepsis, annual transplantation, and heart-, skin- and penis problems.
Transplantation analysis, especially protrobinal time increases, were described in 6 per cent of the patients in the hospital with COVID-19 while expecting functions were observed by 4 per cent of the group.
About 20 to 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19 have increased the pigment (transmission).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive therapy was seven days.
According to the investigations of cases of premature disease, the average time from the declaration of primary symptoms until the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to the National Health Commission (NHC) study, the mortality rate among men was 2,8 per cent, and between women is 1,7 per cent.
Hystophoatological studies shows the differencies of alveol with cell fibromsidates in both lights.
Virus cytopathic changes were observed in pneumonites.
The external spectrum recalled the accurate syndrome of the syndrome (ORDS).
11.8 Per cent of the deaths registered by the National Health Commission of China, the heart-related problems were to increase the tropin or the delay of the heart.
According to the data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and the access to medical resources and the social and social situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Death assessments are different from such regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequate effective calculation of cases in a simple form may lead to increased mortality level.
However, the fact that death occurs as a result of the previous diseases may mean that the current mortality level is not valuable.
In the smokers, the COVID-19 symptoms were in general developed in 1,4 times more and some 2,4 times more to need in intensive therapy or died compared to non-commercies.
One of the Hungarian clinics found that some patients who were injured from this disease had reduced the number of lights to 20 to 30 per cent, and their scanning has been detected.
After recovery, this can also lead to the syndrome “Send of intensive therapy”.
As at March 2020, it was unknown whether the patient's virus rescued immunity was dealt with against it.
According to other coronavirs, it was considered to be reliable, but it was also reported on cases when COVID-19 tests were still positive.
There was a place in these cases that was a long-term depressed place, not a repeated depression.
Virus is natural, has animal origin and represents infection disease.
The factic origin of the virus was unknown, but the infection was almost completely condemned by human transmission from December 2019.
A study of the first 41 cases confirmed by COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, was called the first date of the first disease.
Official data published by the WHO, that date is 8 December 2019.
A number of methods are usually used for quantitative mortality assessment.
All figures are depending on the region and the dissemination of diseases, and also affect the amount of testing, quality of health systems used by treatment schemes, since the success of disease and population parameters such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO has brought an inadequate help code for MCB-10: U07.1 — for the death of the laboratoryly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 in case of death of clinical or epidemiologically diagnosized COVID-19 without the laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to the statistical data of the University of Johns Hopkins, the global number of deaths and infringement cases is 6,9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191).
Some other methods include the determination of mortality rates resulting in disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have been finalized in diseases, as well as the determination of the mortality rate resulting from the infected infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (as well as unidentified cases), resulting in diseases.
These statistics are not related to a specific time and reflect the population's indicators since the infringement of the disease has been completed.
Despite the use of anticorps, not all patients who have been infected, they can understand how many people have been infected.
In Italy, Castellone d'Ad, a small village of 4600 people, 80 persons (1,7 per cent) are no longer living.
In the city, the disease was distributed during the juvenile carnaval among youths, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all cases of COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been reloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have anticorps, judged by donor blood indicators.
COVID-19 is an official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
Pandemia and mortality levels are different for men and women.
According to the studies carried out in China and Italy, the mortality level above men is deadly.
The largest risk group is a man older than 50 years of age; the disappearance between men and women is reduced since 90 years of age.
The mortality rate in China was 2.5 per cent for men and 1,7 per cent for women.
The accurate reasons for this divorce are not known but may be in genetic and conductive factors.
Gender immunological differences, less diversity of smoking among women conscious of men (e.g., hypertonies that are younger than women) may be a cause of higher mortality among men.
In Europe 57 per cent of the invalid men were composed, 72 per cent of the death of COVID-19 were men.
As at April 2020, the United States Government did not conduct gender statistics on COVID-19.
Studies showed that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ORVI have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, particularly medical personnel, are women, accordingly, more opportunities to be taken.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official appointment of this disease, COVID-19.
The Director of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan Gabreusus, explains: “CO” means “coron”, “VI”, “virus”, “D”, “disease” and 19–19 when the first time identified was: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographical position (e.g., China), animals or groups, as required, international recommendations on the names aimed at preventing stigmatization.
WHO public communications further use the term “COVID-19” and “COVID-19” virus.
And disease, and the virus itself is usually called "coronavirus".
During the initial injury in Uhan, China, virus and disease, normally called “coronvirus” and “Uhanic coronavirus”.
In January 2020, in accordance with the recommendations of 2015 on the use of geographical sites in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the term “respirator disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCOV” as the temporary names of virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, official names were published, “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2”.
Because of the limited number of standard samples of certain digital service producers print medical materials, such as the tanks to take a skin, and the details of IDP devices.
In one of these cases, the Italian clinic was urgently needed in the ventilation clamp, and the supplier was not able to put it into the necessary periods, then one of the local productions was revised and was able to print the necessary 100 clips per night.
After the first dispersion of COVID-19, the Internet has become a high speed of the various theories of the reservation, desinformation and factual information on the origin of virus, its scales, prevention, treatment and other aspects.
It is likely that people may be able to infect the virus of other animals.
The results of research did not confirm the dissemination of virus among porcs, skins and skins.
There is no approval vaccine from virus or medicines for his treatment at this time.
Today, government organizations, academic groups and sector researchers have various international vaccine and drugs of COVID-19.
In March, the WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial Programme, which aims at assessing the health effect of four existing connections that are the most effective ones today.
There is no vaccine prepared until there is, but different organizations are actively developing vaccine preparations.
As SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are in human cells using the ACE2 receptor, so scientific developments are using the results of previous studies carried out by SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to create a total-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether an inactive or dead form, is intended to make a rapid immune response to the new COVID infection.
The second strategy to establish sub-unit vaccine aims to establish vaccine that enhance the sensibility of immune systems to certain virus associations.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at the destruction of the S-hispervised white, which helps the virus to be presented in the ACE2 pharmaceutical pharmaceutical receptor.
The third strategy is the development of vaccine based on nuclein oxygen (DNA or RN vaccine, new vaccine methodology).
Experimental vaccines, developed in any of these strategies, should be checked on security and efficiency. 16 March 2020, in Sitell, began the first clinical test of vaccine for four voluntary voluntary volunteers.
The vaccine contains an improper genetic code copyed from the virus that causes disease, and the antiterrorization has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this suggestion is confronted.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical tests are conducted.
The preparations approved for malaria were evaluated during the seven tests, four of these studies were hydroxylophin or cloron.
Prevention of anti-avirus preparations is a major part of the Chinese research; nine studies were carried out in a number of countries at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of vaccine and candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 was conducted with a number of other existing antibodies for COVID-19 treatment, including rhedezir, chlorokin and hydrochlorokine, lopenar / ritonavir / ritonavir, and ritonavir/ritonavir.
In March 2020, the pre-released use of the rhinder was provided.
The clinical improvement has been observed in patients receiving redistributors as an exception.
The three clinical tests are already carried out in the United States, China and Italy, and the application of chlorokine that was previously used for malaria has been reviewed in February 2020 in China and had an preliminary result.
However, there is a need for an expert assessment.
Corea and China health organizations recommend the use of clorokine.
The UHhanian Virus Institute recommends a substantial zoom in one gram, but notes that the duration of the substance is very dangerous and may lead to the annual outcome.
On 28 March 2020, FDA has issued a permission to the extreme use of hydroxylocarbon and chlorokine to consider the doctors treated with COVID-19. The 7th Chinese publications also indicated interferon, fishing or inhiphenoirs as a means of COVID-19.
Previous data indicates that fisheries are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for detailed in vivo study, demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in low concentrations. Studies showed that, in combination with ACE2 receptor, the transmbraran protease bleeding should be used for SARS-CoV-2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies of the use of cloroxicin and hydrochlorokine with axitromicina or without it have serious limitations that the medical community does not allow to use these methods without more detailed study. Ozeltemvir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unexpected.
Hypercytokine can occur as a complication in the late stages of COVID-19.
There is a confirmation of the fact that hydroxycrokine may have the properties of hypercytokine, resulting in a small study carried out by the Chine National Health Commission, the recommendation of coronavirus treatment was included in the toxicism.
The preparation was at 2 stages of an unrandomized test carried out at the national level in Italy after the positive results of his use in patients with serious disease.
In combination with the analysis of the pherritine blood in order to detect cytocin cuttings, it is intended to oppose factors that are considered to be the cause of death in some patients.
In 2017, FDA was approved by an interlayin-6 anagonist based on retrospective thematic studies for the treatment of the syndrome of the release of steroid refractric cytokines resulting from another reason, the CAR t-clear therapy.
Today there is no predominant and controlled evidence that toxicism is an effective treatment of cytokine liberation symptoms.
Transmission of cleaned and concentrated anticorps developed by patients in immune systems of COVID-19 is currently considered as an invasive method of passive immunization.
The strategy was tested in the treatment of SARS patients, but its results were unsuccessful.
Neutralization of the virus is an expected effect with which the passive treatment of antitelams can ensure protection from SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as anti-telo-depending cell citocytoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be used.
Other forms of passive anti-thermal therapy, for example, using monoclical anti-terms, are being developed at the stage of development.
