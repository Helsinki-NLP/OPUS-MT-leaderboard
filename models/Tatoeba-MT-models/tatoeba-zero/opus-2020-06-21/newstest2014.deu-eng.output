Goodach: More security for footballers
They are not 100 meters away from each other: on Tuesday, the new B 33-food house is taken in the village park - in view of the older househouse.
Two plants so close to each other: slaughter or citizenship?
This question has been clearly answered by the Citizen Meeting last night.
"The Council House has been installed at that time because it ensures the school road," he explained yckert yesterday.
The Kluser range is safe for both radars and bus vehicles and the mountainle habitats.
The installations which are officially employed are important for the crossing area of sulzbachweg/Kirchstraßes.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the bus location, a doctor and a bank and the transport flow from the residence area ›Grub`.
"Besides the high transport and footstep events, the security of which was to be taken a further camp", says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold by the Country Council of Offenburg.
"In the current measurements, at the B 33 days, about 12 000 vehicles are the municipality of boaach, which are about 10 percent of loading", says Arnold.
So the construction of another building is more than necessary: "Security is simply in here", says Arnold.
Overall, four transport views were carried out, and a circle movement was also considered, but reaffirmed because of the crossing in the sulzbachway/Kirchstraße area.
According to Arnold at the location of the masks, it was before tested: "What an extra for us with specially long wooden transporters have shown whether these vehicles can go out of the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without switching the mass."
The upper 15 000 euros tear template itself is the "modernest that is presently on the market", explained Arnold.
The installation is equipped with pharmaceutical LEDs, which so strong that lighters of the vehicles are well recognised, for example, at a deep sun.
And smooth, it is also: older light devices consume about 100 Watt, the new one just eight times Watt.
Pro drivers have three light installs.
Arnold explained the technology of the new installation: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
Press the footstep button, the upper radar sensor tests the transportation position.
If the road is free, green comes directly for the footballer, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the footer.
"If a group or disabled people walk on the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone will be safe over the train," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver should think here as a partner and observe the trains.
This wasn't the case yesterday: Kum showed the sample for green footballers, a high-class card was cut out - at light red.
Josef Winkler writes the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for over 30 years.
The disasters of his Catholic villagehood - the unreasonableness, the ham to cruel violence, the enemy and joy - have described many times the channels.
The booking prices are known primarily as prosa autor, the theatre texts are rar in their work.
Collection of Prosatextes Gerhard Fresacher provides for its "Weather Lights on the Ting Pipe" which is now in the Garage X at Peter's place, so a collection of prosatexts is together.
The theatmarcher connects some elements from the autobiologically expressed Roman "The Leibeigen" (1987) with prosaminations from "Leichnam, beauding his family" (2003).
On the widely empty white shoes - important requisites: a circle swimming sofa, which is copulated and masturbated - the eighth swimming insemble is covered by the text material.
This seems to be a little trust in the text.
The 70-minute performance overcomes the template with a full of regional accidents, known as the Repertoire post-dramatic game shapes.
In particular, the players are taking into account some of the fragile scene implementations among them.
They will be shocked hard with the head under water, with their dinner robbers on the wall.
On the other hand in Zelophan or Chiefs, they shoot in dangerous high shocks through the incense, or monologisize their soundstark or slowly shocked on the ground.
The text, however, is little to do so.
The best moments have the night when sweet - the band width is enough from Deep Purple to the popular song.
At first, the overwhelmed routine comes something to calm, and Winklers's sudden absurd humor is breathed.
A Blackbox in the car?
American road planners are searching for a money source to repair the decreasing highway system, and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box found in the carriage of each car.
The devices recording every kilometer driven and reporting the information to the authorities are the key point of a contraventional attempt from Washington and the federal planning office to revise the old system for the financing of US-American roads.
The normally more slowest area of the road planning has recently been a intense debate with good alliances.
Freedoms have linked to environmental groups and expressed themselves that the Government can use the small boxes for the registered miles – and perhaps where they were carried out – and the information can then be used for the calculation of tax decisions.
The Tea Party's been displaced.
The American Citizenship of Civil Rights (ACLU) is also very concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
However, while it is not possible to take some steps in the Congress, several federal States are not waiting longer.
They are currently checking how they can change to a system during the next ten years, pay payment by driver per miles.
Thousands of drivers have already tested drivers with some with GPS monitoring.
This is really a museum for our country.
“It is nothing we can use only,” said Hasan Ikhrata, head of South California Assn. of governments, who plant a record of the mile to all California cars from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time since the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes, is created by the Americans at the snakeboard.
But in America, it is not so much more than previously.
Autos consumpte less benzine.
The State Mineral Oil Tax of 18.4 cent per Gallone (for more than 4 euro cents per liter) has not been increased for 20 years.
Politicals do not have high prices to increase the tax only for a hundred.
“The benzine tax is simplely unacceptable” says Lee Munnich, a expert on transport law at the university of Minesota.
His State has recently equipped 500 cars with driver writers to test a milk-based payment system.
“This is the most sensitive alternative for the long term” he said.
Official clamps shall be called a milk-based user expenditure.
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberalities is income, for instance, the tax has been used to influence the driving behavior so that the stage and climate deficiencies are reduced.
The Californian plans set up the system for the preparation of strategies to achieve the ambitioned, legally enhanced objectives of the State to climate change.
However, the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transport Committee, also stated that he sees the most long-term alternatives.
The Reason Foundation's free marketers are also designed by the idea to allow drivers to pay back-up routes.
“This is no tax that disappears in a black lake,” says Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Reason Directives.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American departments who requested the Congress in 2011 to move on a mile-based calculation in direction.
The US Senate approved the last year a $90 million of your pilot project, which had included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the Representative House prevented the position and reacted to the concerns of Members from rural areas that people have to return every day to the road to work or to the city.
several states and major cities, however, are not moved on their own faust.
The most engaged one is Oregon, who currently affects 5,000 drivers for the greatest experience of the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage expenditures instead of the mineral oil tax to the State.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also makes this.
Illinois tests it in limited measures with Lkws.
And the I-95 coalition, which belongs to the Ministers of Transport of 17 states in the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not universal heat.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers had been equipped with the devices recently, car drivers were skeptically thinking that the government could follow each of their movements.
“Remembering against Big Brother and such things were a great problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of the Strategic and Results Management Ministry of Nevada.
People didn't want it.
When tested, the ACLU of Nevada warned on his website: “It would be relatively easy to convert drivers into an adult supervisory device.”
There is no need to build a giant, sperm technological infrastructure that would be used inevitably to include data about the daily movement of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a number of federal States that are now able to look after a skilled technology, with which the State can take the kilometers driven, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, Khan, would also be quiet to the public.
The Jagd after this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company named True Mileage in California.
The company has not occurred originally to assist federal States in the tax of vehicles.
Moreover, it was its goal to spend in an encouraging market for Kfz insurances, where drivers should pay on the basis of the travelling miles.
But the devices tested are also interesting for the road planners because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that are regularly loaded by modem.
“The people are better ready to participate in when their speed and locations are not registered,” said Ryan Morrison, director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs, great errors were made.
There are more and less intrusive opportunities to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners try to give a number of selection opportunities to drivers.
You can decide for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not select any device and pay a lounge expenditure based on the average miles driven by all residents of the State.
Other agencies hope to be able to sell the concept of a mixed public by employing the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, a vehicle official wants to develop a tax device that allows it to pay park costs to be paid only for kilometers that are driven and the speed data of other vehicles are really obtained by the car driver’s station.
“Automobile would be motivated by the major value of the benefits offered by the system to participate” means a planning document of the city.
Some transport plans, however, ask whether the whole speech of payment per miles is not only a huge decrease manner.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission on the area of San Francisco Bay officials, the Congress could simply solve the problem of the highway Trust Fund by increased fuel tax.
Additional single payment or an annual allocation could be carried out by drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consumpte little gas, so that they pay a correct share.
“ There is no reason for a operation if a aspirin is sufficient,” says Randy Rentschler, Head of Legislation and Public Affairs of the Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers take care of their privacy and many other things.
Royal field: Small management wakes
The volunteer's voluntary fire shooting confirmed its snake test, despite personal lacks of Bravour.
Only 11 men took part in the training.
Commander Hans Kammerer had seen the presence of the Federation in the Burgberger Street in his survey.
There should be a short conclusion at the seed.
The fallen fire and the development of smoking were damaged by two people, but one of them could be sent up a call.
Two breath protectors of the wear were prepared after the first review of the seat by Hans Chammerer to participate in the building.
After a short time, it began to find the first person and lead to free.
The second person had to be taken.
This wasn't so simple that a close strike was overcome.
The building, a workplace with integrated steel for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It was a lot of wood and also strohballs there.
There were still electric machines for wood processing.
The first slaughter passed over the tank in the vehicle.
Another guide was carried out by a overflow hydrogen in about 100 meters away.
Now there were three solutions.
In the building, there was also a heat rail rail rail in the building.
Hans Chammerer was also showing what is to be edited with less available staff.
In serious case, support is held on the king's day-to-day group.
The commander was satisfied with the end of the practice.
Connection of high schools and enterprises is important
At his visit in the countrycreen Breisgau-Highwarzwald, President Guido Wolf also explained how the workers came from tomorrow.
In the Summit Centre, he went to work with the business leaders of the vocational schools as well as the circle gymnasium and the parent-advisor of the Council.
"Education is an important position factor", said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the connected school project education centre high-school.
Wolf showed its impression on the model projects for training.
Since 2011, in the forest city there is a successful cooperation between the Food Centre, the Gymnasium and the Professional School.
He also loving the family friendship in the country.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in view, but also the phase for the care of families, because of the demographic change, is also the stage for the care of the family," said Wolf.
He also argued that more employees were careful for the work and care of their families.
"No support of employees can lead the resulting load of employees to an end of the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But nobody could be able to lose qualified workers, he said he continued.
Another, especially important factor is the linking of high schools and enterprises.
"They who has already learned the advantages of the region during his study remains with its acquisied knowledge and abilities often of the regional economy, which is involved in strengthening the region," the President of the country's country was convinced.
Because only if there would be sufficient training places, the experts could also be covered.
Its opinion is that the origin of the Cruz is its advantageous situation in Southern Germany, directly close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the already undertaking efforts to enhance the development of public individuals on his train from Titisee-Nestadt to Freeburg.
"Keep still hard and ensure that public transport will be better", he explained to the address of the communal politicians present.
Living a maintained afternoon with music
Ready for 15 years, the family Kull is able to enter the dieting seniors to coffee, kitchen and then to a vesper.
Before the older people were engaged in the race city.
In the midst, this afternoon is found in St. Josef.
The householders enjoyed the sweet sweet sweet sweet shoes and gates.
Afterward, there was a swimming salt.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and his father, Karl Kimmich.
For over 100 years, the ancestors of Nature Steel as a pre-limiting of the old school courts before sanctions are to be re-established by the city's sanctions plan.
In the first days before the Kilbig, a small anglesmore was built to stabilise and statistical discharge of the old natural stone wall with Balustrade over a hundred years.
Another step is that Alexander Misok from the Braunlinger City Building Employee, to integrate the country's design and to create an approach to the old wall.
In addition, a cost calculation is intended to be made by experts, which will then be put to the Joint Council to decide and to determine the further action on the table.
A decision on this question would be expected to be taken in the next year.
After sanction, loading and tree planting of the old school court within the two side flights of the 1912 building schools, it is necessary to be taken as a follow-up to the need for sanctional restrictions and for new underbuilding.
The historical, hundred years of old delimitation of the Old School Court to the Kirch Street, is especially through water and frost damage, since there is no dragon, needs of sanction and has a degradation in advance.
Deep rise in individual stones constitute weather damages, but the wall is now not threatened.
A steady wall is a condition for one of the students to use school rooms, which is carried out by the current confirmation work.
It was originally planned for school sanctions even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure was made a movement.
A major word in the historical schooling that has already been used for films will be talked about the country's design.
If the offers from this page come from, then the city hopes the Browningen to subsidies from the thinking protectioners.
The students of the brunling basic school, which are re-educated again in a well-known old school building with new aula, can immediately use the old school office.
Ezdemir wants to receive Jazzaus training in Stuttgart
In the continuing discussions on the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Ezdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has now been enabled.
"I think it was wrong to leave the universal training in the Stuttgart School," said Ezdemir the "Statguarder News".
Jazz and classic are just in the Jazz stand of Stuttgart together.
As a result, Ezdemir, who is a favorite for a direct mandate at the federal election on 22 September, is the Green Red Land Government.
This strengthens a new order of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg on the basis of an expert study.
In addition, Jazz and Pop, from the Stuttgart Music School, to the Muchhoch School of Manheim, is intended to be moved.
US green: "Super tunnel" for drug polling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, the investigators have discovered and stopped a "Super tunnel" for drug smoking.
As the United States customs authorities informed, the long-term round between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail lines and a shipping plant.
Three suspects were then arrested, eight tons of Marihuana and almost 150 kg of cocaine.
The tunnel has not been used accordingly.
"These cards are stupid if they think they could be shocked under the radar," said the United States General Countries of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference before a camp house in San Diego, where the tunnel was discovered.
To the drug groups, Duffy has been assured: "If you continue to build this tunnel and try to use them, we are decisive to make it a huge use of your furniture money."
The US officials and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against drug cards.
Since 2006, more than 770,000 people were killed in Mexico.
Constructed by experts
Because of the extent of the tunnel, the investigators show that it was built by architects and engineers and that the construction has taken about a year.
The closure was so equipped that there could be electrically employed cars.
On the Mexican side, access is located in a building that is 80 meters away from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader of 20 meters deep to the real tunnel ring.
The tunnel has a corner of 1.20 m height and 90 cm width.
It would also be appropriate to promote the illegal immigration direction of the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine friend.
The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the invited marihuana.
All three threatens as the maximum punishment of long-term freedoms, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels were discovered, it continued to be held at the press conference in San Diego.
But it is the first time that it was found in such a tunnelbuilding cocaine.
Normally cocaine is shocked in smaller quantities and not by tunnel.
This said the "dismission" of drug groups whose traditional routes are part of the world, Bill Sherman said from the DEA Drugs office in San Diego.
You would do everything to get in the United States.
No details were known to the prisoners, at least one of the mexicans, called it.
You have to be sentenced for ten years.
2014 Chief Festival
The Jubilium of the city of Geisingen at 1250.
Repeat the first original consideration is increasingly closer.
If the year ends in good eight weeks, the Jubilee year will be reached.
Gestiones and church houses were first mentioned originally.
In churches a original origin was made in both places.
On March 15, it should be an official attack on the Jubilee Year, and since the guests have no hall at present, this accommodation is located in the place where both of them were mentioned in the church houses 1250 years ago.
In the Jubilee, some events are planned in gemises as well as in church houses.
The church houses will be in July at a staying end from 18 to 20 July the 1250.
Another feast.
On Friday with a festival, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Churchalhalle.
At this celebration, also the Church's Hospital Festival is the church feast.
The city music director Rudolf Barth wrote a contract composition to three terms for the Jubilium city.
On June 21, together with the Sunday of the Black Wald Convention, on July 12th, in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and indicated in the Jubilee year, the official term is on September last weekend, on 27 and 28 September.
A new chronic will also be drawn by the shock of the city jubilium.
"But a chronic should be not only from the mixtures itself, but also a printed work on the visions of today, which is, as well as from gestures, church houses, leipferdings, alphatus and goods", says Master Walter Hengstler.
And also the celebration of today's birthday 2014, 1974, has been completed with the invitations.
The new chronics will then be submitted on 21 or 22 November in the new Festival in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also a year with many Jews.
On February 8th, Strohglonki began with an injury at its 60-year-old existence, the harmonie is 90-year-old and has the feste and celebrated the district music celebration on March 29th and then from 1 to 4th May.
The old work of Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the sculpture school has been a new place for 50 years and is celebrated on 10 May, the musical polyhymnia Leipferdings is 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the Brunning Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was mentioned originally in 764 first times in an expertise in the ownership of the St. Gallen.
The origin was formed in churches (audience) that was then the court.
Both communities have been mentioned in the same origin.
On the basis of 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year-old year, further, the Community Reform is still back 40 years.
The Council adopts a view to the vision of the visions of the European Parliament and of the Council
Should the transit "Am Hirschen" be slowly restructured to increase transport safety?
Yes, the communities have decided.
Siltach must take $220,000 in hand.
The German Bahn will improve the twenty-third trails in the coming year.
In particular, it is intended to increase the safety of rail transit transmissions - it is regularly rounded to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the Communities vote towards the restructuring measures, they must participate with a third party in the costs, the rest shared trains and ships.
Schillachs city-based master Roland Greecehaber explained the specialities of the Bahraining "Am Hirschen".
The city plants the city to build an exhibition in the west of the railway at the height of the tunnel Monde.
There could also be larger vehicles, for example, such as transporting long-level, to be in contrary with no need to block the legs.
Greece has therefore proposed to build a necessary supporter so that the city could extend the road to the next time given to ensure unresolved transport flow.
This was discussed in the Council of Commons, since some routes were doubtless the need for a road distribution: Thomas Kipp, with his expression, brought the stimulation of the critics to the point: "Do we want to take so much money for such little vehicles?
Citizen Thomas Haas discussed: "Hirschen" trail transit is regularly used for long-term transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is being transported partly by this road because the vehicles long to 20 meters could not use the roads on the heavy bridges because they couldn't leave there in the main roads.
Furthermore, the routes were argued for vehicles not to use the tunnel when the main road is locked.
It should be said that Kirchberg and Closeberg Tunnel should be reconstrued and sanized as this is the case in Wolfach, it could also be an important transportation for a longer period.
The routes agreed to investigate what costs would cause the estimated distribution of the road.
Despite this, it was widely agreed to the reconstruction of the rail transition, as the necessary supporter will be built so that the city can build the next road direction "Bahn Court Streets", where appropriate for shipping transport around 5,5 meters.
However, the restructuring of the transit to the Gerberrei Trautwin could be a very different problem, which concerns the driving into the strongly increased "Geroltz houses".
The management had allowed the trends to be investigated by the engineering office Breinlinger, as it doubted whether the planned closure of the household was still without any further possible.
The investigation resulted that it was not excluded that the relationships of the road could lead to higher vehicles.
The responsibilities for this are back to the city as road construction loaders.
The reconstruction could then be able to follow detention lines.
Since wood exports and deferences were functioned in the current development state, it should not be agreed to the restructuring of the trail transit, argued.
It is also significantly less than the risk of a train collision with a vehicle on the transition, because it is directly next to the middle of the stand point to which a good view is connected.
Even the trains from the main station should be shocked in this place so far that no collision is threatened.
Most of the rail transit was rejected the approval, since the city of Schillach had to "defeat the problem with residential vehicles," the rays, as the trains could return from the responsibilities after the construction work.
As an unfair problem, the body considers the rebuilding of the rail transmissions "for Heubach" and "for Kuhbach", for which crossing agreements have already been taken with the train.
Esa decides about large world space missions: Millennium missions
More planets, gravity housing or black purchase - experts of the European Railway Agency must now be on two major projects that they want to start in the next years.
30 proposals were to select, five are still in the pension.
TV Worlds.
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronoms.
If there are at least some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: should you search for gravity?
Or do you want to investigate the origin of the cosmos?
Or do you find out an extraterrestrial life after desperate planets?
These questions are just the responsibilities of the European Railway Agency Esa.
For its "Cosmic Vision" program, they search for ideas for two major space vehicle projects that should lead to the research.
The state for such "L missions" is about a million of euros.
The start will be expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the Elite of the European World Space Research was held in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were held at the debate, five of which have now been in the closer choice.
Many organizations observed the proposals to take to the researchers.
In the next days, a final decision should be taken by the scientific programme committee.
In total, four major questions, the Esa has chosen to find answers to the programme "Cosmic Vision" initiated in 2007.
What are the conditions for the development of planets and life?
The exact operations in the development of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the development of planets that round these stars - are still in the dark darkness.
A large infrastructure cap all over can cut this dark.
And if a star has planets, what circumstances can exist there?
To address this issue, 2017 the World Space Telescope "Cheops" is intended to start with the 500 well-known planet systems in our neighbouring environment.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomies could shape decorative planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "Biomarns": gass that apply as an index for biological activity.
How does the sun system work?
This question is also to finally conclude what conditions it exists for the development of life.
A important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the changing effect of its magnetic field as well as the part of the radiation with the planet system.
In our solar system, these procedures can be examined by example.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already authorized a mission of the M class (of the budget is about a half billion euros).
The sun is intended to start 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and his moon are very interested in researchers.
They want to find out what role the Riesen Plan has played in the development of the sun system.
For this, the Esa presents the first of the total three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The sonde "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) starts their trips likely 2022.
Eight years later she reached Jupiters and intends to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the heavy Month of Europe, Callisto and Ganymed.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The world has many possibilities to study materials under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the natural laws of us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are derogations that may lead to the physicians to a new theory, including all known natural laws.
How has the universe emerged and what does it exist?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was shocked through the snake.
Besides our swimming material, from the stars, planets and lives as we exist, there is dark material, whose weapon power and galaxy purchases, and dark energy, by which the expansion of the world is accelerated.
Until the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first seconds burns of the origin, nor what dark material and dark energy exist.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already authorized a M mission which is planned to start for 2020.
With a special telescope, the sons will first examine the distribution of materials in the universe and allow back-cutting keys to the beauty of dark materials and dark energy.
Who could do the rain
The 30 proposals are only two remaining at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chances for an approval as L-Mission have, according to many "E-Lisa", a right approach to the evidence of greviation housing.
In addition, physical changes have been understood in the structure of the space time that Albert Einstein had predicted about 100 years ago.
They weren't shown up until today.
Elisa could create it, hoped the scientists behind the project.
The mission presents one of the two or three detectors that exists, which is stationed in all.
In contrast to the earth's plants, he could also demonstrate gravity housing that have emerged at the urine, and thus provide new knowledge about the decline of the cosmos.
Four further proposals are still competitive towards the second L mission: a large round-end telescope named "Athena", which is to investigate, among other black shoes, "Icy Planet", a mission on the external sun system planets, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background rail, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which will be monitored and investigated.
Proposals for sample rock transport from Mars, for research of Mond, Venus and Asteroids and Solar Physics are prepared.
Snowden is ready to cooperate with Germany in relation to the US supervision
Edward Snowden, the Whistleleblower of the United States Secret Service, stated that he was ready to travel to Berlin and to go before the German Federal Day, if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not give answers to their activities.
The German Deputy Hans-Christian Structure found Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received this asylum to talk to him about the speech in Germany.
In a letter of Snowden, which was presented on Friday of Strubele the media in Berlin, this writes: “If the result of my efforts was obviously positive, my government continues to deal with a disappearing view as a fidelity and attempts to criminalize political expression with criminal threats, where no defence is possible.”
The truth to say is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden states that he is convinced that the support of the international Community can convince the American government to let the complaints fall against him.
The accused of the United States Court of Justice includes the sponage and the slaughter of State property.
The German Deputy Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to the time Online: “When Mr Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, then we find the way to make it possible.”
The relationships between the United States and Germany have been disappointed by the auditions that the NSA has heard the phone by Kanzler Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the Secret Service, explained that the opportunity was to listen to Snowden as a witness if possible, “if it is to be threatened and completely destroyed the relationship with the United States.”
Strubele, a deputy of the Green, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists at his visit in Russia.
Strubele explained that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden, Snowden could not return to Russia when he leaves the country.
If Snowden expressed in Germany, he needed a assurance that he was “safe” there, so the deputy.
Snowden, in his letter, states that he was exempted by a “preceding and continuing” persecution campaign that had taken him out of his home.
However, he is touched by the world's reaction to “my act of political opinion”.
Citizens throughout the world and high-range politicians, even in the United States, have declared a comprehensive monitoring system as a service in general.
In his letter, Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation, “if the difficulties were resolved around the humanitarian situation.”
Frontier Airlines receives payments for handback
Frontier Airlines plants to demand 100 US passengers who want to consume on their flight bag.
Frontier Airlines is intended to calculate up to 100 US dollar for a piece of handback and $2 for coffee or limonade, even if the advertising was to read the passengers should keep the whole dose.
The new payment applies to the handbag in the shuttle over the seat, small tiles under the seat are still free.
Frontier declared that you were calculated 25 US dollars when the payment was previously paid, and 100 US dollars in travellers who only paid on the flight.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the cost of 100 US dollars was able to move travelers to care for the payment.
“We do not want to calculate this amount” she explained.
Airlines began to demand the first and second kitchen payments for 2008.
The passengers who tried to run them, therefore, have shooted as far as possible in the handbag, resulting in that the bags are often filled over the seat.
Budgets are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said, "It's really not going to get money.
It goes about the most faithful clients of Frontier, who had expressed clearly that it would always be more difficult to find the place in the section.
Passageers who buy your tickets on the website of the airline company must not pay.
This means that a passenger may take a bathroom free of charge at the Frontier flight in circumstances, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable bag.
O'Malley explained that the website of Frontier and the check-in would change, so that passengers were informed about the cost before they came to the flight.
The new thickness of Frontier is only in force in the summer, there is no precise date.
Passagers often spend over bags and other costs, but airlines are pleased to go back to it.
They argue that the transport of the bag costs and passengers should pay this service if they want it.
Many of the Wall Street considered the new bag costs as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of aircraft after years of loss.
The majority, however, leaves the fingers of payments for handbags.
Spirit Airlines Inc. requested the first payment for handbags and later followed alligant Air, also a flying flight.
The only other aircraft company with such a tax is the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained by the Airline Barat Jay Sorensen, which takes attention to the additional costs.
He estimated in a report from December 2011 that the handbag costs of Spirit would be $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously launched a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, was recently fled with spirit and was shocked with what would expect him at the flight when passengers would face the unnormal handbag cost of the company.
“The Boarding process belonged to the most slowest that I experienced in my aircraft,” he said.
I expected to see dentists and hand-creative discussions at the flight.
“The aircraft was full,” he explained, “and the Board loved as shocked.”
Frontier also follows the spirit of $2 requested for coffee, tea, limonade or saft.
The company explained that passengers who purchase limonade or salt, which would keep the whole dose and be filled with coffee free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had recently tried to demand for refrigeration money for 2008, but it returned seven months later after passing passengers were estimated and no other large society had been seen.
Frontier's step to upload costs for the handback if passengers do not buy directly to the airport company, the recent initiative is to be transferred with the customers to the own website.
Airport companies pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars for sales tickets.
This offers all companies an incentive to move passengers to direct purchase with them instead of a online travel office.
However, the Frontier has been the most slightest of this area.
In September, the company began to forgive a reservation of a online travel office only half of the ships of flights.
Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25% of the flight.
A flight travel with Frontier over 1000 km is only 250 miles away from a third provider.
Passagers can also book only when buying direct on the website of Frontier Places.
Frontier has a faithful Customer party on his seat in Denver, but the business is broken and the company loses money.
The resolve returned to 9 percent and the aircraft capability slowed about 13 percent in the first quarter, as it was to read in the financial report, which was published on the midday afternoon by the Mother Concern, the Republic of Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic has tried to obtain the financing of Frontier in the context of the sale of society.
Words from the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last woman’s fellowships in the Gospel Church Commons in this year.
The theme of the day in the Common House was "Sprake words from the Bible" and "Remembers from the Middle Ages".
Zita Kohler, the Chairman of the Church's Community rats, went to the Bible's words after the breakfast.
"Speaking words contain life sciences, rules or warnings," she explained.
They compared several words with the relevant Bible texts and explained the importance.
She called words like: Be shocked, as shoots fall from the eyes, shut up a eyes on someone, the souls of the Lord in sleep, his hands in innocence.
Many times the referendum also urged their listeners to what word it was.
The speaking of the Middle Age took place by the Church Communist Christel Dehner: All good things are three, blue, something rewarding.
She declared the importance and origin of the discovery that she called "bridges in the past".
To finish a tombola was dismissed.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorly recorded before they were transferred to the winners.
Between the visitors of the breakfast round, Roman Waizenegger was also a civilian candidate.
Learning instead of work: Pilot project for unlearned in Tourism
At the Mecklenburg Sea plate, a pilot project was started for the Tourism Sector.
The Federal Working Agency has to be qualified by 49 women and men who worked as an unlearned in the industry by three winters to hotels and guests.
"Another thing is that the six-month course ends with decisions," Carmen Wiechert said by the Employer Newbrandenburg.
The benefits are multiplied: the participants would not be working, the company's debt experts, which have always failed in hotels and guests, and the Agency should not finance unemployment.
The project also participates in the industrial and trade chambers in Newbrandenburg as well as the German Hotels and Guests Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg.
NSA states that a "indoor error" and not hacker was debt on the Crash of the website
The estimated National Security Agency declared on the late Friday, a error has lacked their public website a few hours and not hackers as online was captured.
“NSA.gov was not achieved tonight for a few hours, since a planned update has occurred an internal error” the Spionage Agency explained in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be addressed tonight.
It is not true that the deficit has been caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS).
During the early nighttime, online servers have found that the NSA website was at least six hours not reached and that is still not available for some users.
A NSA speaker to ABC News had previously stated that the sensible internal network of the Authority was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, so the speaker.
At least one group of hackticists took the NSA website with a DDOS attack.
In such attacks, the target site is transferred with page calls until the server is loaded and reports the site.
The cybertics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to reduce the internal network of the target system.
The previous super-secret NSA, whose name was no-Search Agency (No such authority), is located in the light of the public and looks like the extensive intelligence on its extensive monitoring programme in the internal and foreign crisis – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the exiled former NSA-military Edward Snowden.
The growing contraverse for the secret service was initial speculations about the fact that today is the result of a targeted cyper operation.
Simply cut the number of people without job in October at 22 to 1.307.
Although the quotas with 3.1 per cent better than last year and even better than in September, "We would have expected more", says Monika Fielders-Bauer, the representative director of the Working Agency in Solar Courts.
Because many companies have reacted to conduct in settings.
For this reason, field-bower says: "We have no experts in handwork, health care, and in the old age."
Annual time is required since September also re-equipment offers for staff at hotel and guest shopping.
In the middle of December the winter season begins.
The whole background report will be found in the Alliance Table of 31.10.2013 (See 33).
Budgets in Bombardiers after return to delivery payments and contracts
The Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Inc reported on Thursday a 15 percent decline of the net wine after he had been under pressure by relief orders and supplies to aircrafts in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail party.
Bombardier with Sitz in Montreal also published no flight tests for its branding flight of the CSeries and has not provided any new information on whether the aircraft could go to the commercial use in accordance with the honourable timeplan in September next.
On the juvenile flight of the test flight over a half months, only three further starts were followed, which it seems questionally whether the test phase runs as planned.
The results remained behind the prognosis and led to a course of over eight percent at the Toronto’s Burse.
Cameron Doerksen, analysis at the National Financial Bank, sent his evaluation of “outperform” on Thursday, in order to have a limited rate potential in the next two quarters.
“There were weaker delivery numbers in aircrafts, but we are clearly disappointed,” said Doerksen in a customer.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program is forwarded to the aircraft.
However, if there are no new orders in the coming months, we hope that the market will be more skeptic than the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft can catapulate the company in the lower market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test flight was presented in March of the public and was the first time after monthly delays in September.
However, there are binding orders for CSeries with 177 moderate, since potential purchasers are waiting for the results of the aircraft tests and want to see whether the purchasing of the company in relation to the effectiveness of the carriage and the cost of the new aircraft.
Currently there are total 403 orders and commands of 15 customers and society.
President Peter Beaudoin is convinced that the bombs will reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the Jet.
The company management also assured the analysts and media on Thursday, and the program was in the Terminal Plan.
“The test driver has not remained on the ground longer than expected,” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added, while the aircraft’s period was implemented soil tests and software updates.
Each manufacturer plant is different.
We have decided to take a first flight and then apply a revision period, which we have also done.
This happens during the whole flight program.
The second of five test flights will be expected to start in the next weeks, the remaining short later, called the company site.
However, analysts remain skeptical if they can operate a CSeries flight 12 months after the first customer’s flight.
Bombardier declared that it reviews the planning for the inclusion (EIS) and will update it within the following months.
“The slow pre-screen of the flight test – even if it obviously corresponds to internal planning – enhances our view that the involvement moves to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardiers had net winners at $147 million or 8 percent per share of $172 million or 9 cent per share in the year.
The adjusted wine per share does not change 9 cents.
The surplus was low and slow from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cent per share and an overwhelming of $4.56 billion, so Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer has delivered 45 aircrafts in this quarter, a decline of 57 in the last year.
The net orders fall from 83 flights on 26.
The contract file in the air and space shipping party was on September 30, 32,9 billion dollars and was unchanged against 31 December.
“In the area of air and space passengers, the results were in the framework of our offers, but the low tasks and the market relations were totally detrimental,” said Beaudoin.
The transfer of the air and space shipping part was about 13 per cent of two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the largest rail manufacturer in the world, announced that the transfer of this part has increased by about 11% of $2.1 billion.
The contract file in the Transport Party led to $32,6 billion in September 32,6 billion and was easily increased against 31 December.
The benefit level in the field of transport has been threatened by exploding problems in some major contracts.
According to the company management, it will be given for the fourth quarter new provisions.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier Action was at 8,5% and was at 4,83% of Canadian dollars, after announcing that the Google Financial Force would be changed into the state.
The Brazilian Emmbraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturers and bombs in the area of Rivale, reported on Thursday a decrease of 10 percent of the Quartal winning.

Cocaine dependent lawyer, who warned the drug boss before police investigation, must be in prison
Basharat Dita, 42, provided information on the submarino size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependence could come to light.
He was sentenced by Liverpooler Crown Court for three years of prison.
A well-known criminal who warned a drug baron before a large police investigation because he feared that his secret drug search could be discovered was sentenced for three years.
Basharat Dita, 42, provided under-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about the investigation of its activities in drug trafficking after it was compromised by his own cocaine injury.
The lawyer who was sent by criminals as “precisely classified” was arrested in his house 2011 after overseeing the police Scarborough that he had been in a previous drug procedure.
The officers observed how Scarborough (32) three cocaine kitchens at the lawyer's house in Primo, Lancashire were delivered, while they were with colleagues at a dinner of the lawyers.
The investigations showed that Dieta regularly consumed drugs of class A after testing cocaine sprays in his hairs, on his letter towels and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to create unautorised information on the arrest of two men in charge of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were observed by the police in the context of a great investigation procedure on heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They were later arrested together with 32 other people after the police in a number of home surveys Heroin and cocaine as value of 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of bargeld.
Dita, 42, continued information to the criminals because he feared that his drug dependence could be public.
Today, Dita was found and condemned in two cases because of the prevention of the justice for the court in Liverpooler Crown Court in Liverpooler.
He gave the cocaine possession at a preceding survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police was found in his investigations against Scarborough that this had been regularly contacted with Derta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to the Ditas House, and there was the drugs with a cleanness of 60 percent in a black golf shock under the lawyer's mullton.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly called with Dita, who was located at the football station of the Indian Rovers in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, the drugs helped, and then nine communications were discussed between the two.
Before the court, it was known that Dieta was a “regular consumption” of cocaine after testing drugs of class A in his hair, his letter tack and on his credit cards.
Dita was later arrested, but he went to take cocaine and said he had spoken to the murmurant dealer because he was his mandate, and said that her debate was subject to the “secret of lawyer”.
During his arrest, Dieta took his letter tap and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and took him a hair test.
In the police hearing, he would call him at home for legal matters, both under his private address and on the workplace.
Before the court, it was known that he had called the important drug trade a number of stakeholders, which had previously been sentenced, and was informed of what the investigator knew about them.
An Ambassador Anne Whyte said: “A criminal lawyer should be better than everyone else know that it is not law. ”
Thista is accused of the miscarriage of his position as a criminal defender, since he has left himself too much with certain mandates.
The fragile relationship is not just the drug driver, but a drug driver who offers his lawyer with drugs.
One of his communications was certainly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these people.
However, this was far beyond the borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and mandate.
He took the police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to follow their criminal activities.
Mr Dita has thus brought his vocational position.
He was close to certain mandates, especially Scarborough, and made it compromise of his independence.
Dita pointed out any misconduct of himself and said: “If I was a corrupt lawyer that I am not, and I wanted to give information to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait for 15 hours but do so immediately.”
However, after hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead from the police in Lancashire said: “Jer. Dieta has done the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to buy drugs from organized crimes.”
His cocaine dependence led to an unexpected compromise and made him acceptable for the reasonable leaders of organized crimes that were assigned to take valuable information on police investigations.
The applicants must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and trust.
Dieta has left this confidence and tried to spend behind the fascination of his professionals.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also leaded to a sentence in three cases because of the ownership of cocaine and justice disability, which underlines our determination to bring crimes before the court.
In this case, criminals should be a warning and show that no one can get out of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to the court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced at 14 years of prison after his conspiration to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Fifty-five more of the drug trafficking persons were sentenced to total punishment of 153 years.
On his website, Dita published a area of questions and answers on which he acknowledges his dream job to be an advocate in the death cell in America, his final guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and opportunities to be the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of the church music
To finish the celebrations of 160 years of existence, the song newspaper Dunningen is rounded two of God's services with the "Deutish Messe" of Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which the observers in the spring of this year, the player newspaper will be able to complete the Jubilee year two of God's services with the establishment of the German Messe of Franz Schubert.
On Saturday 26 October, this extraordinary messe will be heard from 19 during the evening meal in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday 27 October, from 10.15 p.m. at the service of God at St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Messe with the original title "Peace to the Holy Opfer of the Messe", D 872, is a religious musical work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826, which was almost revolutionary.
The Messiah is listed in the framework of God’s service, how the commander Johann Philipp Neumann had it in a sense.
Under Hermann Sneider's leadership, the chor is accompanied by the Blue group of the Frohsinn-Frohsinn-Tenn sources and Noemi Lokodi at the orgel.
Haslach: Skepsis slightly viewed confidence
For example, the elections for the Farrgetherat 2015 will be changed in the basic one in the Seelorge Unit of Haslach (SE).
There is only a common paradise for all six pararries.
On Saturday, the organizations of Haslach, Hofstads, Mollebach, Fisherbach, Steinach and Wolchenstoneach were prepared on the changes.
Because there is nothing to change the basic decisions of the diocese and it is to the farmers to implement it as much satisfactory as possible.
In the course of the day, it was particularly clear: the skepsis against the new skepsis was slowly shocked, but looking at a belief.
From the ideas and expectations to renew 2015 towards concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parrors community, the extremely constructive meetings of the six bodies with the main officials of the Seelorgeam.
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained, on the basis of a presentation, the new directives for seelorg units in the Erzdiese Freeburg.
The SE Haslach, as a church community, is in the future a body of public law which enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities until now.
It will only be given a common parliament and a Foundation Council in which the Force of Force is represented.
Each parameter should be represented at least two members selected, in the six parriages are formed in the locally called communal teams.
Your task will be for the future to promote church life in place.
The question of the financing of the individual parliamentary community showed a significant need for discussion.
The renews suggest that joint goods are able to be obtained in the Faroeans.
However, the liabilities are overcome to the general community.
With regard to the large investment planned, whose obligation then takes all the pararryes, there were great concerns.
"As in the past was invested only in projects that could be overlooked alone by the individual pararry," related Haslach's general President Bruno Princesbach.
Practically experienced with a common body for five pararries, Barbara Ritter, chairman of the body in the Seelorge Unit Schutterwald Neuried.
They had been assigned to 2006, "Every one, five remain" and had to figure out that it wasn't so easy.
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelsorge Unit then were to answer the questions on the future composition and size of the common partnership and the practical work of the community team.
The preparations will be concretized at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the next spring year.
At the end, he presented the new logo of the Seelorge Unit, which was approved by a significant majority.
In Pfullendorf the electric is owner
The Pfullendorfs citizens must set up on higher electricity costs.
As the head of the city works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SUDKURER, will be reached by a four-powered Pfullendorfer Family 70-90 euros More costs per year.
The main reason for price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC environment of 5,277 to 6,3 cent per kilowatt hours.
This changing will be re-established each year by the four operators of the large electricity trails in October.
These are the multiple costs resulting from the energy use that they can be able to overcome the strike.
The townworks Pfullendorf are the last member in this chain.
In its prognoses, the Supervisory Council of Energy was even a higher channel, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now the concrete payments should be calculated before the cities works could inform their customers about the exact price increase.
"We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x", so Bias, which will take the number closer to 2 cents.
Temple on Duration Red: Watch at waiting time
Sometimes a amp will not simply green.
The contact drives in the street are not reacting, or the light mark is defect.
What do you have to do - walk at Red?
If a person concerned has waited enough on a red camp and the crossing is free, he can continue, the Stuttgart Law lawyer Ralf Becker explains in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time should be "acceptable" which can be expressed in case in case.
Becker will take at least five minutes before an employee is defeated.
However, those who continue the driving despite red light should be clear that it causes a caused accident the full debt.
A person who suffers less than five minutes is not waiting enough under circumstances, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Ham.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the ample after about three minutes and had to be responsible for a slow red light oversight.
Indeed, the template was not infect, but a little later turned to green.
A driving ban left him because of the special situation - but the punishment was not.
The Community Council welcomes the solid budget
Only when it goes on the household meetings, Master Ralph Gerster has laughed well.
The Commonwealth Suck of Herdwang Beauth is well filled and debts have already known the management since 2005.
In this sense, the 2012 budget can also be achieved as a full success.
This was clear in the presentation of the year calculation for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros should be higher than planned.
The overwhelming of the administrative budget also constituted about EUR 1.8 million over a million over the approach.
In particular, the oversight should be increased income tax revenues and the Community share in revenue taxes.
The resources budget was also clearly over the values planned.
Instead of the expected EUR 1.5 million, it was 2,5 million in the last year.
"This is essentially the higher delivery of the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investments have been assigned in the financial year 2012, reimbursement is also higher.
In total, the overall resettlement of EUR 2,1 million could now be increased to a total of 4,9 million.
Major Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"So a work isn't just protected from the smell," Gerster pleaded with regard to the annual calculation.
He and the communists expressly enjoyed the good numbers.
It may be paradox kling, but precisely these good numbers may come to the citizens soon.
With the good financial situation, the community was able to reject high-earths in the past.
But Gerster said that the country has already been shortened by the country.
There are conditions for these aids from different compensation deficiencies.
Among other things, the cities and communities requesting subsidies must present certain parts.
"The theme of the Gospels we need to look at, since in the coming years investments are in which we would like to have subsidies", he stated in this connection.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in Chor
With 60 years of sing as a songer, Hubert Wermter's history at the men's adventure Cécilia is almost double as the birthday party, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter was as living in the colors of his men's associations on the bridge.

The mixed chor was entered into the Neapolitan people's "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also returned to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were belonging to their program.
The Basinger Sports Department came back with "What's the Smooth?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts "Bierlied" back to the country's fil, where the full-marinary music counters the creative musical end.

Kenya Press Recommendations on Controverses Media Law
“We are in an enormous situation and may be asked: what does the Parliament consider simply to simplify the right independence tomorrow?” was in the newspaper that holds the draft legislation for non-constitution.
“The law is dramatic and very punishable, and we rely on it,” said Cyrus Kamau, head of the Capital Group, who is also heard of CapitalFM, one of the most independent radio stations and news sites Kenias.
He said that the new media currencies “It's always been prescribed because it's a long-term arm of the government” and restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenias' position in the global economy.
“I hope that the President listens to us and we call him to abrog this draft legislation and to return to Parliament,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government was taken by the new law “Mediums effectively in a degree”. The standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya would have suffered“ a serious slaughter” and referred to the project as “dragonic”.
The adoption of the law is part of a number of measures to strengthen national security in the afternoon of attacks by armed Islamics at the Westgate Securities Centre in September.
The Kenyan media moved to the angry of the authorities because they were published in receipts of security cameras where they were to see how the luxurious purchasing centres sent to the murder.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo reacted to listen to the appointment of two journalists and a leading media provider, even when the invitation was taken after a rise of the media.
According to the new law, media households can be incurred with a punishment of up to 20 million Kenian students and individual journalists with up to a million, as well as the other risk to lose their professional recognition or to be excluded by official press credit.
The Court also has the right to acknowledge the ownership of the interested persons if a punishment is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “the majority of the radioscanners can be cut into the bank wheel”.
Furthermore, the newspaper views that these measures could have a devastating impact on the description of their "liberal blogsphere" Kenias.
If they take the media to the swift, the politicians could do what they want.
"No one will ever learn", wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at the country, who describes the Kenian media as a decisive control factor in public life.
“If the politicians are left themselves, they lead the country to the banking route and us back in the time of the jagers and Sammler,” he commented.
The Kenyan lawyers have already turned up the public wrongs in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the disadvantages arranged by the National Countries Commission and put their deficiencies in force of some 532.000 Shilling free of tax for month – they are the highest world.

Prepared 15 years ago, the first discussions on solving the problem were considered at the construction of a third place at the end of the football club or at the real school at the Salinen Sea.
Both of them were rejected.
Six years ago, thinking about an art sport, which was generally considered as the last solution.
Concrete plans were recorded two years ago, when the FC exceeded the stage in the landscape, accompanied a cost contribution of 100 000 euros for the construction of the place and accepted the country for 104,000 euros.
In October 2012, the Council decided that the remaining EUR 356,000 was covered to the total costs of 560,000 euros, a fax clump.

The new-building opposition is frozen with a new coffee.
One who invites to disappear and return.
One who wants to make the name for the program.
As Dejà Vu, Lexicon is called a psychological phenomenon, expressed in the sense, to experience or have seen a new situation.
In the case of the same coffee at the opposition in the Circstown Kleve in view to high school Rhein-Wal, it must not remain at the clean Dejà Vu feelings.
Finally, the coffee has the beautiful name exactly the objective: a real residence is not only thankful but always experienced.
Because it's so fun and it's easy.

But there was also the Ringel Nazi.
"Best, successful and witch," the two 33-year-old men found.
But not everybody's thing.
Maybe Daniel Büttner isn't also a fan of event ends: "You can't do all right now."

United Nations proclaims new objectives for poverty combating
The United Nations starts immediately with the preparation of a number of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty 12 years ago.
In the preceding of the UN Sustainable Development Meeting, which began at Rio de Janeiro night, Australian diplomates played a key role in the establishment of “stable development goals” to replace the Millennium Goals in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the Summit.
The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced on the meeting on the evening that the time was to “remember national interests”.
“I am glad that Member States have understanded to attack a process to be agreed with universal and sustainable development goals,” he said.
“They will build our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the framework for development by 2015.
I will not be able to implement this mandate from the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that will build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been no win for four game days, the handball overseeers continue to have a good stimulation.
There is no doubt for Trainer Tomasz Malmon.
All are still fully motivated in this matter.
However, I hope we will eventually win again.
"If I don't know anymore how a victory is shocked," Malmon expects a successful experience of his manity at the VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third-legal reservation of Fredenbeck has still not exhausted trees, Malmon has warned the showing finger in the precautional field.
Many players have been trained in the A-Youth.
Therefore, they will be particularly safe against their former coach.
"It must be expected if it is still strengthened from the first place," said the SG coach.
In order to eventually return to the success score, the Malmon team must be increased in comparison with the last events.
Before all things in the switch work and the switch game, it was finally powerful.
The evaluation of opportunities must also be definitively better.
So I hope my players have finally got the head free during the short pause.
Safety concerns in Mozambik growing in view of communications between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered together in the centre of Maputos under the waiver eyes of the Statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the State and first President of Mozambique, in order to accept peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, director of an investment undertakings.
In the fear of the future of the country, she slaughtered its business towards a T-shirt with the record ‘We demand security’ in Portugal and joined the amount on Thursday on the city’ independence.
Since two weeks there are reports about the daily convergence between government forces and Renamo, which are the worst feasts since the peace agreement over 20 years.
Renamo was at the time a defenced rebellion, which was initially supported by Rhodesians ruled by white and later the South African government was trying to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became a party to opposition.
Analysts are undoubtedly thinking that the country has returned to an adult conflict, but the recent events of foreign investors and domestics have threatened.
For the fast growing economy, it is much on the game, because the discovery of huge gas conditions before the coastal coast and coal in the northwest could in the next few years invest more than 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the country.
The dominant Frelimo Party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo is one of the same infringements.
Renamo argued that the government had caused the most recent concentrations by attacking their members in the Sofala Province, a traditional Hochburg Renamos.
The controversies on the previous rebels were excalled as government instruments attacked and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, declared Renamos speakers against the Financial Times.
The government gives Renamo the blame for the confusions and accused the organization to attack soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to discuss concerns about instability.
On the other hand, AFP, the French News Agency, said in the midday that Dhlakama is considered a “perdidor” who wants to “use all his remaining forces to prove that he could imply his decisions to the Government”.
And Frelimo and Renamo stressed that they want to avoid war.
However, the concerns have been increased since Mazanga has been quoted with the words, Renamo gave the peace agreement of 1992.
On the contrary to the FT, he stated that Frelimo did not respect the agreement.
“Our vision is to react negotiations and seriously,” said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have contributed only a few of the expenses that have been covered by a number of commutations in this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who gathered the heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, the Dozent at the Open University and the Mozambik experts.
No one is good in the negotiation and no one is ready to make the necessary acceptances.
Renamo, who goes to election reforms, has already declared that it will join the communal choices in November.
The elections of presidency and Parliament are planned for the next year.
Some comments have interpreted the use of violence as a attempt to move a shocked movement, to make the government responsibilities and financial benefits.
Since 1992, a new party that will be improved by a former Renamo Member's Democratic Movement (MDM) in Mozambique (Mozambique).
Mazanga states that Guebuza – the decline of its second official period in the next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
“He doesn't want a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace, because he doesn't want to leave the President's office," says Mazanga.
It is unexpected about the ability of Renamo, but it has undergoing unreasonable attacks against police stations and vehicles on a major North-South connection.
Most feet found in the province of Sofala, which is about hundreds of miles north of Maputo, where Beira is located, the ports, mountain construction companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale for export of carbon.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of rail trains for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga continued to answer the question whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that the things in Mozambique are not good, said Mazanga.
The instability has still increased the flexibility of the government, says Fernando Lima, the leader of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many have already been careful of corruption, smooth progress in development and a short delay.
“The people think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and should be the solutions to the problems,” he states.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrant, said the people just wanted stability.
“There are no interests in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want to go back to peace and useful streets” he explained.
Childs should be taught by myths and legends as “Princes for Life” means a author.
Thor's stories showed that “brutale power does not have an opportunity against clear tricks” and the art legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were “reserved to be wild, angry and in some cases to be taught at schools” because Crossley-Holland was declared for a “supportable choice” of old judiciary works.
“I'm wonderful that myths and folklore in America are already part of the education,” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that, with authors and teachers who were “overly dictated”, children would be “completely disabled”, because in detaine stories the messages would be communicated “sub-screenly”.
Crossley-Holland, which has translated the Beowulf from the Angelsish and is the author of the Penuin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: “It is possible to follow certain intentions, but you should keep it in the background.”
The greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and an author who writes for children is the need to give hope.
Not everything must be simplified or lead to Happy End, but there is an imminent sense for good and bad.
This must be intercultural, revealed by the story and not declared.
This is the old story of the show instead of telling.
Hansyakob is again in Freehof

With their song "O Jesuine" they enjoyed the public in the free court as well as the stortenday skiner with their "Heruit, Herus".
His criticism at the Official Church had expressed in the same way as his concerns about the developments in the agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the impact of the war.
In the household, behind his grape caps on the fire at the courts, he found his rest.

Bayerns Basketballer, despite the first decline
Even the first strike in the Euroleague could not deteriorate the huge optimism at the basketballers of the FC Bayern München.
"No one can ban us to believe that we can also win against the best team of Europe for the last two years," reported Bayern Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) Monday at the Olympiakos Piréus.
We sent the message: there is also Basketball in Munchen!
At their first third involvement in the European king class, the munchers were very good to sell, but they were not sufficiently cleared in the decisive phases.
The guests first created the art room to convert a 15-point swimming stand 13 minutes before closing, before Pireus once again gave the game a shift.
"We have backed us incredibly against the two times Euroleague Champion, but then we have made easier mistakes", said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbleti.

Ben Greenman: ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City's birth place in America is: just hundreds of years ago, the artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Congressor at the Theatre Palace at Broadway, began to tell the amount of Witze directly in the form of a conversation.
In the course of the years, Fays innovation was developed, as recently on the New York Comedy Festival.
In life calls and guided by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Statup Institute, Carolines, celebrates his ten-year-old jubilium with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“The majority of these headlines went to Carolines and then became more successful until they were known at any time to get up in a club,” said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
At the present year, there are events of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes”, a annual musical and commodity workshop for armeeveterane at Madison Square Garden, at the other Bruce Springsstones, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.

A number of Comedians who participate in the festival this year have been known over more unconventional ways, such as sendings on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known with a sitcom in the cable view (The League on FXX has now its own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the term “Saturday Night Live” as well as “Parks and Recreation”, although she is the most known for her viral video series “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On”.
Even Slate and other young Comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the iranic and race themes, focused on the race topics) are products of the decentralized world of the American Comedy.
The largest visitors of the festival belong to an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up Comedian, but he developed a viewed television and film register as well as an informal Comedy historyr.
From 2005 to 2007 he modernized a TV show with the title “Sit DownComdy with David Steinberg” at TV Land.
The meeting is located in the Town Hall in Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the Comdy DNA of Larry's whole work,” said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, then he sometimes goes through the gas between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose my whole money, I may live here.
Iran's satisfaction with the nuclear negotiations process
Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five United Nations vessels and Germany.
"Any years later, you have made an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to spend the differences of the last years", wrote Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way, but the nuclear headquarters should be satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will be a solution.

The former federal soldier, who worked after two posts in Afghanistan as a tourist, was an understanding within the framework of a process debate.
Then, in five cases, he has learned women through Internet or telephone contacts that he sent to the strike for a few weeks against her will.

The court had no longer to be taken by the damaged women.
As a Kripo official reported, at least four more cases were identified after a first statement by telephone monitoring measures.
The voted discussions were expressed by high aggression.
In later appointments, the damages had confirmed their martyrium.
Another Witness, in which one of the women had discovered the blue fleets of the whole body, has not made a statement until today.
It is about "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this body as normal.

The reference rood spots for delivery in December was fallen in the electronic trade in the New York Mercantile Exchange at 96.24 USD per barrel last morning.

In the course of five weeks, the offer was increased to 25 million barrel.
However, on Friday, there were more information on demand by two reports on an activity increase in the Chinese manufacture.

The Court blocks the decision on the NYPD's stop-and-free directive
On Thursday, a Federal Training Court in the United States blocked the order of a judge who requested changes in the stop-and-free program (the "conduct and investigation") of the New York police department, and reverse the judiciary of the case.
The Court of Auditors declared that the decisions of judge Shira Schandlin would be issued until the city was decided to be professionalized.
In August, the judge judged that the city was contrary to the Constitution in the way the programme for maintenance and demands of persons was implemented.
The city took vocational training against its evaluation and the measures required, including the decision, to establish a supervisory body to support the police in amending its directive and the relevant training programme.
The Professional Court heard the arguments to be requested on Tuesday.
The Professional Report stated that the judges should be linked to the case, as they had injured the Code of Conduction for American Judges by determineing that a judge should avoid the appearance of the participation, which was partly based on a number of media interviews and public appeals in which it had reacted publicly to the criticism of the Court.
The judiciary had judged that police officers had violated the citizen rights of ten thousands of people, since they are aimed at approaching black and Latin American men with the stop-and-France program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes, including reforms in directives, training and services, and ordered a pilot program with cameras carried out on the body in four places where most of the controls were performed.
In August, the city of New York was ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were resolved after a control by the police.
A public negotiation on the city's profession is planned after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-Frisk tactic was criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
The controls of this type exist in various forms for decades, but the number of controlled during the official period of the participating citizensman Michael Bloomberg was a total period of 684.330 in 2011, most of them were black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who listened to all minorities, a clamp was developed to a collection.
For changes in the NYPD's stop-and-furk program, changes will end in fair practices and create a more confidence and effective police and influence the way other police presidencies use the rules.
Instead, the changes would fight the morals of the police, but not the criminality, but the money would not be resolved and the broader problem of a police, which is under pressure by thousands of offices in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that they did not end the stop-and-Frisk Praxis, which was constitutionally, but only the type of implementation of controls by the NYPD.
From the luck of the dreaming camele
Happiness is a oase to reach only dreaming camels
With this beauty, the first Chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the Agreement "Helper Hands".
On Satunan Thursday, the tenth birthday of the Agreement was celebrated, which can already show great success.
The first Chairman Henne reported detailedly about the work of the Agreement.
He was the first time in Mauretania in Chejk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott in 2004.
A further cooperation was developed, and the Gynacologe Henne carried out on a number of travel operations on place.
During the speech, images were shown on a large shift, so that the guests of the Jewish Jewish event could make a image from the actions mentioned.
The aircraft of the Convention has also been shown.
This is a former federal border vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, made the proposal to install this vehicle with a photovoltaic device and now plant, according to Henne, to be active in a consultant function in the Agreement.
In 2008, the roomei Slee from Baier sources in the record time of just one week has created the hospital station in Socogim, a quarter on the border of the capital city - honorably.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-kind hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times in Nagold, the birth clinic is to be eliminated.
There are many learning in Africa as medicines, so Henne, for example the acceleration of Burn-out.
Because of the political disappointment in the country, it was not possible to work as many travellers planned, but many doctors came to Germany to hospitalize this place in various areas.
Furthermore, containers are regularly sent to Africa, so that in March this year medical devices, medically, associating materials, hospital beds and briles.
Commissioner Hans-Joachim Fouchel himself provided a hugely local colony by he told Mercedes' manufactures from Mauretany to the mobile chain and the experiences of the stammhouse musicians who traditionally supported the United Nations at their Mauretan travel.
As his personal movement, he called his work in the field of accounting test as a young deputy.
When he became clear how much money was lost, he decided to help the Africans in the control of a budget through the people.
In addition, the fire stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
There should be no way to forget that Africa is closer than some thinking.
It's not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson set phone hacking for checking a tip
The previous news of the Word Heritage Andy Coulson tried to confirm a false tip on a business of the former Minister of Interior Charles Clarke.
State advocate Andrew Edis QC declared the Court at the Old Bailey, News of the World, in May 2005, that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive specialist” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper requested the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys Voicemails, and followed her, but Coulson also called her and posted news as the court was.
“After the State Authority is Coulson, who is now an emergency exhibiter, no one who is before the apartment of people is hoped to struggle them in fresh reality, but one who likes to face people with a story to see their reaction,” said Edis.
He said that NotW spends three procedures to search for stories: phone hacking, monitoring and contrast.
The exhibitor is personally involved in the third method.
Of course, he knows from the second, the supervision, that may not be different.
How does it look like the first?
He knows about the phone hacking?
He resolves this, but we say, "And if he knew it."
Gestures on a business of Clarkes were first attacked by NotW's Fatura Editation when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “Do not use your time, she is together with Charles”.
A band with Vocemails from her phone of at least three requests was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, stored on the Pawlby and their sister as a “project”.
During the time they delivered the search, the largest of Pawlby's anonymous calls, where they were asked after information about it, explained Edis.
Instead, the former Chiefporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup monitored the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the contents: “I have a story we want to get out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles.”
Edis declared, Coulson's activities in this history followed the same pattern as other important personalities, about the former minister David Blunkett.
The gentlemen heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced a ship with a married woman when he himself read with the Mitange-Claimed Rebekah Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks tried to smile with others from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006's phones.
Marcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have given the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned riches tax, the French Fussball is actually launched the first strike since 1972.
A shutting meeting is on the end.
In the conflict of the rich taxes, the Government and the Profi-Fussball in France have been handled in a sackgase.
President François Hollande acknowledged on Thursday, the Paris Elisee-Palast of the United Nations and of the Association, and also heard the complaints.
However, he refused to repay the Fussball from the planned 75 per cent payment to income of more than one million euro per year, which all companies of the country should pay from 2014 for two years.
The opposite also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be carried out, shared by the Head of the Proffix Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The game day between 29 November and 2 December in Liga 1 and Liga 2 shall therefore be decreased.
Features: No absolute protection possible
"We want to join the inhabitants early in the planning," Master Jens Houßler opened the citizens' information session on high water protection in guards.
About 80 participants came to the Community Hall to explain the measures planned, address questions, express concerns and ideas.
He stated: "The last decisions are the members of the Council of the Community."
The high water, which was unprepared on May 15, 2009, had been an unprepared event that caused the issue of protection measures for the future, is so sweet.
A river area survey was undertaken with neighbouring aid, which is now based on the highwater protection approach.
"The protection of the most constructed bases is the goal", says the widespread.
It is based on the planning of protection before a German Water Service statistically expected high water for 100 years.
The climate change is taken into account by a 15% impact.
This is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water mass that had led in 2009 to significant damages were a thousand years older high water.
"A absolute protection does not exist, but a relative improvement can be achieved," he said.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, it is necessary to invest around four million euros in terms of which the community can receive a total of 70% of its support.
However, he pointed out that it is only promoting if a comprehensive approach is implemented.
This should be given to the community to the participation of the citizens.
A permanent planning and approval procedure should be completed.
In the best case, the implementation of 2016 could be started.
Among other things, the protection concept which has already been presented in the Council of Commonweek in the last week (reported) local measures in the influence of the flying irm from the Stammheim Tal.
As a result of the representation of the highwater protection concept, participants use the opportunity to bring their concerns.
It was asked, among others, why do not be planned for the protection of the place?
Gregor Kuhn, Special Planners of the Professional Ingenieur of Forest and Corbe from the Heavy House, who presented the concept, pointed out that it needed the composite of all the measures presented to achieve the objective in the sum.
Furthermore, you should like to find the most economic solution, so Joachim's forest of forest and corbe.
Inhumanity was dominated by the older placers who have always suffered in normal weather rains under a translation of the channel network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, he pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are other than high water protection and that should not be missed.
The community is obliged to describe the channel network so that two-third-year rain events could be strengthened.
Increased water channels would disappear millions.
Injuries after convergence
On early Friday Wednesday, on the country Street 44 near Revensdorf, two cars were hardly injured at a frontal convergence.
The police immediately completed the road, but first it could say little about the accident.
However, there are various witnesses that should be evaluated first.
It provides that the 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW Golf in direction to Revensdorf, and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came with her hydray.
Both vehicles struck together, while the woman was so hard, that the fire shooting had just needed a half hours to release her out of the vehicle wrack.
The real accidents first remained unclassified.
Both deficiencies arrived in nearby hospitals.
The trails remained completely locked for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostojewski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a Godsucker, a metafysizer, his Romans and his stories also have something serious.
Explore the relationship in the eye: the eyes shocking, the bart, the high shore.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is understood with his massive Oeuvre as the founder and apologe of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as American prophets that apply something from their own country.
Some titles appear in the Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans box with the 118 records is two thousands.
Dick declares America - the kingdom of the shocking technical progress, paid with paranoia, security and faith, to be chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read themselves as a mixing from John’s revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy to put drugs on his brain.
He's captured, soon that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what is different from a machine, the Creator from his creation.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killer.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film leaderships such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verheeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The " minorities report" starts from 1956, he decreased the deterioration of the cold war and the McCarthy Tribune.
It will be developed here the principle of the "Pre Criminal Crime", "Pre Crime", which is now more or less official doctrin of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is the same as our horrible, looks for mutants in the future - and the police.
"We take individuals who have disfellowshipped no law," says the Head of the Authority.
"We shoot us before they can act on a violence crime."
And: "In our society there is no offenders, so we have a complainant full of pesudobreachers." You read Time Streams.
They accept that weaknesses happen, and prevent the criminal dealing to be implemented.
Dicks' discovery works like the blue pause for the anti-terrorism seats and the NSA's hearing switch.
Anticipation of the attack: So functions Obamas's drug philosophy and - Praxis.
But Dick's history is not over.
The police chief claims that there is no violence department anymore, the military controls the whole day - and the rest of the State.
Then the supervisor will be overlooked and transferred to a future crime.
The system is rounded.
It's perfect, but it's lie.
It meets its own conditions.
Take the wrongdoers and victims not only in purchase, but also instruct yourself.
The system creates the danger that fights it.
Philip K. Dick's reading says to come closer to the truth.
Sponsoring on Merkel in Russia
The former US secret service experts Edward Snowden could also be sentenced in his Russian asylum in the United States succeeding chairs Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Advocate may, or may, in writing, ask the 30-year-olds in Russia, reported the Interfax Agency.
Last night, the Green-Green Day, Hans-Christian Structure, had taken as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to speak to him about the business.
Improvement of the NSA involvement of company paranoia for public supervisory
On a midday end August, a German police slaughter passed deeply over the US concert in Frankfurt at Main, Germany's Financial Headquarter.
On the instruction of the Constitutional Protection and Terrorism Office (BVT), the German Internal Secret Service, it should be photographed by the U.S. Foreign Post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the predetermination of oversight interests and the action leaded to a vocabulary change between the United States and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, reaffirmed in September that the United States did not have any options for foreign sponsoring, “in order to steal foreign enterprises in order to build their international competitiveness or their profits”.
However, from Edward Snowden, who has become an individual employee to Whistleblower, with the publication of his Fulglens in American Supervisory Secrets, the European Governments and the heads of enterprises have no longer been sure if they can speak to the director.
Reports that the American National Security Agency sponsored the Brazilian Oil Company Petrobas and provided data from the American Cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the company paranoia had made a new level of monitoring.
The passing phase was the interpretation that the Kansler Angela Merkels phone was inclined, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be viewed, it is also safely that business guidelines are potentially objectives.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it's likely to be used to use these data for mutual benefits.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Green, President of the BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German enterprises believe that the United States now posed a nearly large risk of China when it goes to industrial sponsor and data-based, so an investigation published in July by the Advisory Company EC.
However, in Snowden's documents, there was no sign that the United States had transmitted the operational secrets of foreign enterprises to their own companies.
Politicals expressed their concern that the EU had failed certain IT and Internet powers and should reduce their dependence from the United States.
The companies are skeptic in this regard.
On the Federal Day, we should build a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open it slowly...
“This does not work” says Hasso Plattner, President of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you should not have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subventioned, from the carbon through cars to the agricultural.
All up to the IT.
However, scopes and technical rationalities of the US sponsoring authorities found by the Snowden entries were shocked by companies who had previously seen the largest spionage risk in China.
In Cloud Computing there is a great change, since European enterprises are now conscious of the data stored in the United States and, therefore, potentially threatened.
According to one of the Cloud Security Alliance, a business institution, conducted surveys under the interpretations of the US-American Data Mining activities with the prism about 10 percent of non-associative members plans to use a American provider.
Jim Snabe, delegated SAP business leader, says: “We see a new question of customers who haven't had a year ago – she says: Where will my data be stored and can you ensure that this is physically in this legal space?
Many German enterprises believe that the recent reports only confirm what they knew, namely, that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and therefore should be guarded for each price.
It is not surprised that economic sponction is happening.
It was always like that.
“That was a subject for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current debate,” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the Chemistry BASF.
Americans sponsor us at a commercial and industrial level, as we do, as it is in national interest to defend our companies.
The company management is normally not about the contractual measures that have been taken, because it produces benefits from the inverse.
In large enterprises, employees have already been explained that the participation of a free USB strike on a messe or the unexpected license of a laptop in the hotel room is not ratified.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a member of the Audi Auto manufacturer, says that it has been earned to the standard practice for years before a chair, to join the phones in order to not be used as listening devices.
The German BVT is the leading forces to use simple Prepaid handoys when they go on foreign journeys because smartphones may be compromised.
The Prepaid Handys will be removed back.
However, there is concern that smaller and medium-sized enterprises remain attractive to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are world market leaders in the Nice.
“Client and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to protect operational secrets effectively against non-accessed access” reports.
The United States warn their own businesses for economic sponsoring by other countries.
According to Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia and Israel were ordered on Rang two of the countries that were used to purchase economic data of hacking.
A member of a German Blue-Chip company was true when it goes to economic sponsor, then “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former leader of the French internal Secret Service DCRL, has been quoted in an interview in this month with the following words: “The secret services know that all countries, even if they cooperate with terrorism, are working with their partners.”

Parents of a young man from Georgia who died in tragic accident believed murder
The parents of the adolescent whose body was found in a collected ringer mate in the Turnhall of his high school are convinced that her son was killed, explained the lawyer of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, in the United States of Georgia, was found in an opposite Matte found in the back of the tribune in the school hall on January 11th.
The investigators of the sheriff of Lowndes Conunty concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of 17-year-old boys.
“They are convinced that her son was killed,” said Benjamin Crump, lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died as the sheriff was closed.
“They are the view that each logic has improved, contrary to the physical laws and against the healthy human mind,” says Crump.
Moreover, they are convinced that the truth will be pronounced to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to learn to the school and came back to the body hall” he commented.
US advocate Michael Moore said on Thursday, it will give a formal investigation to the death of Johnson, since a number of important questions are still unexpected.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death to come back to a crime?
This declared Moore at a press conference on Thursday.
I follow the facts, in which direction they also lead.
My goal is to find the truth.
“I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation,” he said.
Moore explained to reporters who initial autopsie indicated that Johnson had been killed on the consequences of a “positive shocking”.
However, a second autopsie has given another cause of death, so Moore.
“A number of questions must be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added, if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civilian investigation on the death of Johnson, he will provide the FBI with the implementation of the investigations.
A representative of the Board of Sheriff's authority was not prepared on our request on Thursday for a comment.
A court in South Georgia ordered that the authorities should release all videos of supervisory which were reviewed by the investigators on midnight.
The parents of the youth said they hoped the video records showed how he died.
CDC Public Allergy Directives for Schools
In the mid-day, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a number of directives for the treatment of food allergies of children at school.
These are the first directives issued by the American Government, since the number of debt children with food allergies is increased.
One of the 20 children in the United States has food allergies.
The proliferation of food allergies under children has increased from 1997 to 2007 by 18 percent.
The guidelines include information on schools that should be aware of food allergic allergic learning in the field of teachers and employees, and how to implement with children, the allergical reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrin – the auto injection of the EpiPen Mark is most commonly used – to enable a potential mortal hypersensitive reaction.
Legislators in the Federal States have recently amended the rules so that schools of Epinephrin can be more simplified.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that are mentioned by children presenting an allergy reaction.
Childs may say: “It feels like something pressing on my language,” “My language feels like a hair standing on it” or “It's cutting my language.”
Parents from intersexual children can choose “sexual indefinite”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children who have been born with non-specific genetics.
Newborns are no longer strict to men or women.
According to the new law, parents do not need to explain the gender for such children, but they can indicate “indefinite” or “not defined” on birth course.
The objective of the law is to take the pressure of parents in order to not take overseen decisions regarding operations for sexual instruction in newborns, and to combat discrimination of inter-sexual people.
A intersexual person told BBC years later: “I am no man or woman.”
I remain the filling work that was created by doctors is shocked and full of nerves.
It is estimated that one of 2.000 children comes every year, not as a boy or a girl in the world.
They are among the interexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis “Sexual Difference Disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, chemistry (eyebreak or hod) or uncommonly developed genetics.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of sexual identity is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States were to use the best available information on sexual instruction if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before, if any operation is decided.
The New York Psychiater Dr. Jack Drescher, who has specialized the problem of the sexual identification, said that the new German law “spends on a good thing”.
Interexual children make a ethical dilemma.
“ Some people have life - threatening diseases that need a surgical invasion, but most of them do not apply, ” he said.
You can take sexual instruction without operation and then expect how to develop identity.
Scientific data about how a child actually developed its sexual identity are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It's like the secret, because people are homosexual.
In a report from 2011 to the European Commission, it is said that interexual people are different from transexual or transgender persons, since their status is not sexual, but constitutes their biological constitution, which is not only men or women but typically defined as both timely or not clearly as one of them.
These features were shown in random sexual characters such as muscle mass, glucose, breasts and statues, priority sexual characters such as survival organs and genetics or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination, which views inter-sexual and transgender persons in vocational life, as well as the level of prejudiciary, violence and prejudiciary criminality.
Not with the sex-compliant boys now have a special camp.
In addition, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to designate a man, a woman or a third sex on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was acknowledged as the first “someless” world, after a court had agreed to maintain the long-term sexual status of a “no-definite” sex.
German exhibitions have a third instruction, X for intersexually, so the Ministry of Inlands.
In the nearly France, gender subjects are still contrasting, so a news report on France 24.
In 2011, twelve French Members of the Stric Catholic country signed a petition that would be removed the “sexual theory” from school books.
The American American website Catholic Online also expressed himself against the German law, with the foundation: “When the world is cut into a new condition where sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland declared against the baby zone, she starts better when babys were given a sex at birth.
“The parent’s base is also enough of stress without any other restrictions, especially if you don’t know the sex of your own child,” she said the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
History has been seen children who have been born both with men and women's genders as hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god, both genders.
Another ten years ago, the medicine considered the sex as something that could be removed and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are doubtful, after now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they don't know how the child feels with their child's gender.
“In the midst of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency” said Drescher.
When such a child was born, you were not called the psychiater, but the surgery.
The dominant theory on the treatment of children with uncertain genetics is back to Dr. John Money from the University of Johns Hopkins, who treats the view that the sex is forbial.
He expressed the term “sexual identity” and argued, social and environmental disorders, as parents learned a child, interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and prayed whether a person was considered men or women.
But in a case known under the title “John/Joan” in 1966, his theories were controversed.
He called to the parents of a boy whose penis was disappeared at a decreased inclination, to cast the child into a fully cutting and remove his dogs and then growing him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of change, but what he was not,” says Drescher.
When the boy was around 15 years, he returned to a male sex and married a woman.
But with 38, he was self-smoking.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the access of the Internet, the survivors of these sex operations have occurred to the public, which are “not happy with the result”.
Like Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with men's chromosomes of XY, but two-year-old genocies.
The doctors did not clear whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he could never lead to a man as a “friendly life.”
So his external body and the Hoden were shortly removed after the birth of 1976, and he was grown as a girl.
In the age of 12, he received a woman's hormone.
"I knew I was not a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com.
I was unfortunately, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
In the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressive and knew that something was not true, he requested his medical data.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilised at my birth, and no one told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD which could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genetics.
After he learned the truth, he changed to a man's identity, received testosteron injections and removed his brethren.
He's become unfruitable through the operation.
Today, he fights for others in a organization named Interface Project that inter-sexual people will be treated normally.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the law of the Advocates for Informed Choice in California, is to ensure that the German law can “assimile and stricts”.
“A number of activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to take rapid decisions and to demonstrate the child, ” she explained.
We fear that it benefits interventions.
We think it would be better to show the man or woman's sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will affect, so we can only show.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law, 'for adults allow their recognition as a third gender'.
“ adults should be able to take their own decisions on their legal sex,” she explained.
The German law is the instruction of birth.
It's not a fight to a little kid at this time.
If they are adult, they can decide on their own body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with sexual differences and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law is “compliant” both of parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with men's chromosomes, but has a DSD named the complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosteron, Katie developed women's characters.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no eggs.
Today, Katie 29 is married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a worker in the child psychiatrist.
Although it is unfruitable, it is hoped to get a child by accepting or a sweet mother.
“The law gives parents a room where they do not need to take decisions overwhelming,” said Baratz.
It allows them to make different tests and to clarify things, and there is so time to write them “masterly” or “evidently”.
In this way, everything's fine – you're slinging the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby, and you enjoy the parent's happiness.
And you don't have to take a operation that can't make it back.
“ This closes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear of parents because they are the view that they would not do the right thing, ” she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the sex that is better to him – and that's wonderful.
That means that children will be able to take the decision itself.
Unknown girls hurt by shoot from car
Unknownly, a twelve-year-old in Sachsen has been injured in shocks from a car.
The murders were probably shooted with an air pressure weapons on a group of children on Thursdaydays in Genthine.
That's what the police shared in Burg.
The girl is easy to hurt the left wade.
The rescue forces took the girl into the hospital.
The shooting came from a small car that had been predicted at a group of six children and soon maintained.
The Witnesses saw two people sit in the car.
The murders also shooted on a bus.
I'm sneaking a shit.
Then they took it.
The Criminal Police identified it on Friday.
To date, the police inspection can turn back to a peaceful Halloween night.
The officers were called only two times to embraced children that were against households.
Since the householders recognised this at the time and removed the eggs, there should also be no damage.
Moreover, some Sylvester trees have also been buried in the city area, but there has not been a sachshade.
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his pkw was developed with a slope and used his swimming snakes.
However, until the police was inconsistent, the man has recovered his raids in the closest of all, because the police did not have to continue.
Living with future perspective
In fact, Wa lives smiling Ries.
Your house is in a quiet residence of Stuttgart with a lot of green, a old tree file, well-known neighbors and even not too much transport.
In the city there are only a few minutes with public transport.
"They hopelessly have no fear of skins?" asked Wa swimming ries and shows on a slight skin on the swimming round.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a few years.
But you know how hard this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spinesphobia, but the concerns of not being able to handle many stages in the age of age and in the apartment.
Furthermore, since a Meniskus operation, the mid-fifty-first must learn in the own body, which means moveing to Stockwerk with handicap from Stockwerk.
Recently, a book appears to the subject 'Happy living in the age - What form of residence is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example for what isn', starts to tell her.
When she moved with her husband in the household over 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the green.
Today with half 50 Wa is thinking about Ries otherwise.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are really disappearing with the theme 'Women in age'.
Most of them disappear it as long as it happens.
"The old ones will always be the other," she says.
First, when the pain pressure is really large, you think.
"But it can be too late, so Ries.
In its book, the inner architectine provides 17 living models for a self-determined residence in age.
'But when you choose a living form, it is always a individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution does not give it for the age.
Even those who can stay in the Tuscany or Britain should always be able to see that he can also be sick.
And: 'No good knowledge of the country language will also agree in the Dolce Vita', the Fachbook authors also provides for consideration.
In its models, classic care models, alternative residence forms or the often quoted rentner WG.
In age, everyone has his ticks and masks
'If I'd be so a living community but nothing,' she means with an eye-winkel.
It's not like in a student WG with a common bath and a kitchen.
'It's age, you just need your retreat spaces', so Ries.
However, that a senior community can work, the bookautor does not want to exclude it.
But then it should be different from the classic students WG.
And sometimes you just want his peace, she believes.
In this opinion, it is not at least in the head of the country.
"The most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment so long," is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the civil service's life in the age of the country headquarters.
Your service office is round people around the subject 'olds'.
Thus, only older people would often take inadequateness and restrictions to purchase, only to remain in their habitual environment, which is also the experience of the Warent Foundation.
In this way there are many opportunities to build the house or the apartment free of barrier today.
Ries recommends that all those who are employed with the age of their home or their apartment once fully informed and don't be able to load the first handworkers.
Today, there are also specialists for the right to rebuilding.
Even in the accommodation, this is one or another to realize, and if it is only the toiletten increase, the internal architectin is cleared.
But it is not always possible that the existing apartment behaviour can be transformed freely, even though it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Wa resources.
However, in the apartment, you could install a trapped lift that would also be a widely larger obstacle to the door of the apartment.
She's going to search until she found the ideal object for himself and her husband.
Before the shopping, you're more than before the spring at the door of their apartment.
The United States want to continue to pursue Snowden in criminal law
The United States have not changed their position to the former US secret workers Edward Snowden.
He will continue to preserve, unpermitted secret information.
That is why he should be sentenced in the United States, said the speaker of the United States Foreign Minister, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent Snowden's words would not change it.
Before the German Green Political Hans-Christian Structures had called the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to be threatened by punishment.
Psaki stressed that it was a strict vote on the parliamentary and not on the member of a German government.
The secret service student Edward Snowden is based on a conversation with German authorities.
However, first he wants to know his situation.
This cleared the former NSA employees searched for in a non-reported letter published by the Green Christian Structurer Hans on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and continued to the Federal Government, Federal Day and General Connection lawyer.
The writing has published the following words after a strike translation:
To the competents
I was requested to write to you about your investigation on Mass Oversight.
I named Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously treated or directed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
Towards my employment in these institutions, I was witnessing my Government's systematic contradictions that have taken me from moral responsibilities to trade.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw me a serious and continuing lesson that forced me to leave my family and my homemate.
I live at the exile and enjoyed asylum, which granted me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance of my political trade, both in the United States and in other parts.
Citizens throughout the world and high officials, including the United States, have estimated the interpretations of a system of comprehensive monitoring which is responsible for no accounting as a public service.
These sponsoring interpretations have made many proposals on new laws and directives, which resulted in the formally discharged use of public confidence.
The benefits of the society from these recognitions are increasingly clearer; at the same time the risks taken in purchase were reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government has said, as a fidelity, and then is trying to criminalisize political opinions and declare a complaint.
However, speaking the truth is no crime.
I am convinced that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international Community, will delay this final position.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are understood, I will be able to participate in the appropriate and legal statement of the experts in the media, especially in terms of truth and authenticity of the reports.
I am glad to have a conversation with you in your country when the situation is clear and thank you for their efforts to resolve the international law which protects us all.
Edward Snowden confirmed by Hans-Christian Structure
Child gardens have found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," Winterlingen's citizensman Michael Mayer says.
The former child gardens in the garden street sold the communities to a private person.
The sale of the Community Council agreed to be a part in its recent meeting.
The building changed his owners to a "acceptable" price.
"The community is satisfied," says Mayer.
In the budget, 100 000 euros were allocated.
It is still not clear how the new owners want to use the previous child garden.
The citizens' right is that winters have given the responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and therefore do not need to come up for the entertainment of the house as to heat, to look after the garden and to spend the journey.
"They are now away," Mayer is happy.
Place concert at high temperatures
The Musical Hamereisenbach offers a place concert on the terrace of the guest house.
When Dirigentin Bianca Willmann has the taxstock at 19:30 p.m, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the kitchens of the Hammeric musician.
The Chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music pieces.
Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully handle the first musical hock.
Report: Obama campaign submitted to replace skins by Hillary Clinton
The most closest advisors of President Barack Obama have in secret discussed Vice-President Joe Biden in the election campaign in 2012 by Hillary Clinton, as the New York Times.
The enthusiasm is the considerable surprise of the long expected work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times is an exemplary of the book appearing, and she reported on the Thursday that the President's top advisor would have carried out “increased group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011” to find out whether it would be better for Obama's hope to re-ease when he was falling.
According to Jonathan Martin, the National Political Correspondent of Times, the book is incredibly subscribed to the history of the efforts of chairmans of the campaign and the White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect that it has on the values of interrogation, to cut out the former Foreign Minister Clinton against Vice-Presidents.
The potential changing was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only a twenty-third of the closest advisors of the President – including Daley, the former Championship Chief Obamas, Jim Messina, and the former leading advisors of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the thinking change.
The “double Down” states that Daley had been able to share the efforts, despite its “unity, personal relationships”, before finally decided against such a delay, after showing that Clinton's candidate would “the opportunities of obamas would not be improved”.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government really considered to replace skins by Clinton.
“I expressed a number of things that should be considered, and that was one of these,” Deley explained to the magazine.
It should be reminded that the President had a horrible survey at the time, so we thought: “For God’s will, what are we doing? ”
While Daley's investigations called "sorgfalt offered", Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the re-electing campaign, it had been employed significantly to find out whether such trains are paid for election urges.
“In campaigns, it is not so much money for surveys and focus groups if you do not think seriously about something,” explained Martin at AC360.
However, it is not clear if Obama knew that his team thought about a exchange.
Martin said to CNN, he asked Daley whether his former boss knew about the potential channel.
Even though Daley explained that he did not believe that the President was “conscious of the possible change”, the previous head of the stake said that it was“ possible” that Obama knew it.
Martin added that “double Down” did not give an endless answer to the question whether the political investigations of Obama had reached the desktop.
Cooper asked Martin if he was thinking seriously that Obama didn't know any of the investigations about whether the skins should fall in the elections.
“Possible” Martin replied.
What's going on on my e-mail?
Email is actually e-mail.
Is the same as in the original post, in the design of the Internet's email, the secret has been technically implemented?
In the concept of the previous Internet services, it was a priority to make possible communications.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been considered to create a stable foundation for a hearing letter exchange.
This is why a common email corresponds to an open post card than a selected letter.
If user "Anna" to "Benni" sends a mail, the computers of the two are directly connected?
The email program or the browser of Anna sends the email to the server of their service providers in the first step.
For example, if she has a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This email server sends the content to the supplier that uses Benni.
On the road, the email can be run through some other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his supplier.
Will common emails be shipped through the network through their way?
Most of them will be read several times by software robots.
The supplier is generally checked whether the mail has a damage programme as an annex.
A virus check is also presented on the recipient systems.
Furthermore, the providers check whether it is a quiet and unwanted spam mail that is just removed or at least discarded in a spam folder.
Does the robots have another job?
In systems such as Gmail, the robot also identifies the information that Google requires to place context review.
If Anna and Benni are communicating on their coming holiday visits, Google can hide corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do Unknown people also read e-mails?
The probability that unable people read a mail is extremely low.
Theoretical, however, is possible.
In enterprises, the administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
Criminal persecution authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to take or take account of e-mails.
There are possible illegal sphere actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against reading?
With a encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, a e-mail can be effectively encrypted against a media.
With high technical support, it is also possible to spend the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that you can not even be recognised without any other person who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
The mainly private post cases play Yahoo and Google, according to an investigation of Convios Consulting from August 2013, are only a subdelegated role.
While the last shares of Yahoo Mail were fallen, Gmail was able to clearly post by Google.
Mother in the bowl painted and shocked
When his mom died, a man from Wolfburg was a plan.
He gathered the dead in a forest - and continued to hide their rents and rewards.
In order to be able to cast the pensions and the rewards, a 67-year-old Wolfburger has buried his whole mother after investigations of the police in the forest.
First, he slaughtered the death of the 89-year-old boys, then he put the money more than a half years ago.
Now the 67-year-old kids must respond to fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
Then the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: since then, the mother that was needing was no longer needed for the medication.
The investigator told the rentner that his mother was going to Spain.
Because the officers were wonderful about this, they continued to find them.
It found that the two of them had lived over 15 years in a common apartment and he had recently taken it.
The 67-year-old kids have finally engaged in the death of his mother.
An obduction has not shown that the police did not have any instances for a capital crime.
Is it a glass bleeding in the dark?
A British employee has developed the first in the dark egg – with the help of Qualen.
Charlie Francis did use the fluorescent properties of the sea stars and created a lighting leke.
The idea was that he came to him after he had read a research work about whatlen and was able to convince Chinese scientists to create the light protein artisticly.
The glasscreme reacts with the tongue, which increases the pH value in protein and removes the light.
Chris explains that the food reacts to the warmths in the mouth and light - so much more you're lighting, it's so lighter.
Charlie, founder of the ironcreme company “Lick Me I'm Delicius” says: “The product is incredibly but still in a very early production phase, and there are two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the iron screen reacts with the language at a neutral pH value.
If the mouth warms the protein, the pH value increases and ice lights.
We have tested it in the last months and it seems ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most precious ironcreme I've produced it, because the quantity light is four times more than gold.
Each cup costs me about 140 pounds.
But it's sweet.
Charlie's experimental company with seats in Bristol is famous for its uncommon shoes, including beer, sweet, sweet meat and brown.
But his latest creation is to be more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible iron screen."
This is about and unlikely because of the lightbreak that is called by the iron crisis, from which it exists ice cream; but I am convinced that we find a possibility to create it.
The glasscreme uses the fluorescent properties of a quale which is artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still after six game days without any point in the handball association.
It is now calculated for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory at the last weekend.
With this game the season starts again for us.
"I hope we're finally free of the head," the ears have been optimistically condued.
It's finally available, with the exception of the last hendric Blohme, its complete card.
Daverden also sets as we are on time game.
That is why we must keep our error rates.
However, first-line, there is a need to increase in the cover, which has finally left everything other than a safe impression.
Indeed, Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is the first stage seat against Northhorn.
The game, of course, was a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby it can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to set up Morsum to start a series.
The lack is Jan-malte Jodat.
For this, the A-Young Yest Wind Susse, who is active with double play right to the A-Young-Bramen-Bremen, has its saison deployment.
Whoever isn't warm in that game must stay home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was small, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I dinnerly eated wellness, left late and smell us for neighborhood.
Today, I've become a Halloween kitchen.
In the past two years, I have not been ready to distribute from my apartment from sweetness, and I wouldn't do this year.
But statistics say I'm a black sheep, what is Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate this year Halloween and gives a total of 6,9 billion US dollars for beauty, costumed and decorations, so the US-American Association of individuals (NRF).
One thing I'm rejoicing every Halloween then is the tendencies.
Costimities will be designed for about 1,2 billion of US dollars issued, as the NRF.
In this year there are unreasonable objects of the last cry.
Women don't need to smell in sexy clothing, now they can also represent prostitutive foods such as pizza, Hamburger or carote.
What's about men, I expect every amount of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I think that the Tuft-Punk World Manager will create it in the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most amazing cosmic zombies, Batman, Pirates and Hexen are.
I think it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We've brought our dogs last year, and they were not alone to my surprises.
In fact, Americans give $330 million this year for costing their households, as the NRF.
It's a lot of Hot Dogs.
What's going on, we're not channels.
Americans will pay $1.9 billion this year, so The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolates, shocks, bonbons and gumballs.
Thus, good news for the United States Headquarters' Ministry of the United States 41 million people who are driving through the speech “sweet or saure”.
In fact, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we do nothing – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sweet Candy Corn; however, it will be sold 15 million kilograms for Halloween, so the national association of the good product producers.
It's about nine billion mass.
It's a race that I couldn't solve.
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than houses where it spots.
They have great names such as "Terror Verind the Walls" (which otherwise is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Screen" and "The House of Shock".
Indeed, there are 1,200 officially recognised spook houses in the United States who gets $500 million resolved, so America Haunts, and that ends the wonderful photos that are just in the hose pinkelt and the friends then put on Facebook where they do not get back, and one of the guy on which you are standing leaves a comment as “the other face expression”.
But finally we're coming to the corbeans.
Charlie Brown trusted us with the great kitchen when we were children, and the snake of a snake is like the shock of Christmas tree – something we made from small.
Happily, the "Baby in the Kürbis" trend was just the last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up to access the core and not to sit there.
This year, the US Census Office will pay $106 million for the curbs.
The cowboys, who slowly destroyed in the garden, are probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of curbs were covered this year.
If you want to correct points, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and shoot some wheel from your 921-kilograms.
Apartment burn in Helmbrechts: Reservation forces in the mountains assembled body
The fire shooting had to express the late Thursday in Helmbrecht.
A three-million house in the countrycraft Court starts in the night on Friday.
The rescue forces are mounted out of the house.
Reservation forces have found a decorated body in a three-mile family house at a brand in Helmrecht.
If it's about a people's hand, it's still unbelievable as a police speaker said in Bayreuth.
Last Thursday, it was burned in the home's earthquake.
When the fire shooting entered, the flames are already shooted out of a window.
The implantation forces went into the apartment and found the bodies in a room.
This and another room burned completely.
The whole earth's shooting was damaged.
All other people were not home during the fire, the police speaker continued.
The building is not living first.
The exact cause for the fire was first not clear.
Germany's largest country church has started an opening force to purchase the pastor’s profession.
The Evangelical and Lutheric Land Church Hannover is a possibility of counting about 1,800 pastors and pastors to 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offered good future views, said Pastor Matthis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Gospel Press Service.
It is attractive to determine the labour and day end itself.
With Burfia, the country church first has taken a pastor in full place to visit young people for the theology study.
Today, less young people are decided to study theology after the abdiction.
Burfien brings this back to the process of discipleness: "God's voice is low, the world is sound".
In this way, the profession of great freedom and diversity is expressed.
I am Mr. My Terminal Calendar and I can put on the point where I am important.
Pastors could be close to people as sealsorger.
They paid so much as teachers and could live well.
Of course, more will be paid in the free economy, but theologicals had a safe employer.
This comes from the young people today, which are not only about the career, but also for a full work.
According to the information of the country church, which includes three neighbors Niedersachsens, today around 60 pastors are in peace for year.
At the same time, about 40 results of a theology study start their vicatory.
In these areas, such as the strike, Emsland or Wedland, it can be difficult to place places in the future.
Burfien wants to organize a study day for young people and invite prominent people who have studied theology.
The theology study offered a wide training.
You can even be the Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are resins and six pounds and a free speech.
The options are available to increased brems, a service package with the guard of Bowler-Works mechanisms and logistic support to the vehicle system between events.
Drew Bowler, business leader of Bowler Motorsport, says: “The Rally clients who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced rail drivers, but people who are searching for swimming and absents, as well as after achieving way to class events.
We are glad to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format decides new opportunities to experience the various Rally Disciplines in Britain and the Foreign and to prepare new links on the straights and the reality of Rally Raid.
We had really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge Wagen – that will be a sustainable mastership.
The Defender Challenge also has a training and test day in February, as well as the option to participate in western residents in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefloor to save a dog that set 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock snare in a stone brown
Cockerspanel Hündin Ruby was departured after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a shooter in the stone brown in her misunderstanding situation.
Fire-floor leaflets seen at stones and saved the dog before the safe death.
The fire drove was able to swallow a dog safe, switching up on a 15 meters high slope in a rock door.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel Hündin Ruby was left after a traffic accident on Sunday and survived only three days before she was saved from a stone break.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 who heard the dog, came to the Steinbrush Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to take Ruby back and thank you for the western fire shooting and rescue service.
Nevertheless, they searched after their lost hair and published support calls in social networks when they had gone after the small traffic accident.
It was against 14:15 p.m. on midnight, a swimming shooting snake saw his dog, the swimming Ruby on the 15-m high paragraph in the stone brook.
The technical rescue team of Cleckheaton Fire Station disappeared in place and looked at the relief of Rubys, which was then moved to a dog box above.
Andy Clayton, a specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “It was in a dangerous situation.
They were located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move muscles during her saving – she was like stef-fried.
But now she's okay.
Then she feed a few dogs.
It was a very uncommon use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredibly.
Peter Lau, a specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had a ridiculous difficulty.”
It was the possibility that she was very hard or worse.
Ruby was carried out to the animal physician, but not found anything except creature and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “It was angry to see the salvation.”
I couldn't believe she was upstairs.
It was wonderful to keep them back in the arms.
The animal physician explained that if the creation was too large and it would be broken, it would probably be disrupted.
The fires have made great.
It was really courageous to do what they did.
We're just so grateful and everyone of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson, from Keighley, added: “We had fear that they would disappear, but they remained above. ”
The fires were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger said he never thought Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radiostate this week, the Pop Star said she worked as a bac-round player at Jaggers Song “Old Habits The Hard” from 2004.
Perry explained that she eated with the alcoholics, and that “he was looking at me when I was 18. ”
She added, “It's been long and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70th, said that on Thursday, he “the Categorical reality that he has ever taken up a survey at Katy Perry.”
The representative adds: “It is likely she changed him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the songs that had a host in the Rolling Stone Tour this year.
Your new album "Prism" was on the site 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European disappointment gives the shoot the choice
A new day, a new horrible story for independence.
This time we will warn that an independent Scotland is necessary to participate in the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the sign of history about pass controls in Berwick and a secure border with stacheld roots along the Hadrianswalls.
Indeed, in the Strathclyde Proposal, the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but that was not a role in the lines.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States are often entitled to their strict rules if they are better for them.
As Scotia is not now heard to the Schengen room, the continuing non-conservation of Brussels would only be a small consent against what you really want from the shoots.
So there's no story.
And one who has come so in the years that she's already like a fosil: the first time I heard the "Independence" means pass controls for at least 40 years ago.
This is a interesting point when continuously repeating this urgent history is lost.
Why should a independent Scotland expect it to dance after the European Pfeife?
Why would the London Joch be against the Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great, thorough plan for the association of Europe has been launched on the floor after the war.
With the European crisis, the European project has been officially dead.
Overall in the EU, winning parties on grounds that are fellow to be the EU or want to spend the euro as a Community board.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Party Alternative for Germany – just founded this year – was only five million votes at the Federal Day election in September and thus effectively left the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Federal Day.
There was always a home resistance against the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a point of shift.
In view of the strictly linked Space Policy by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the need for the national economy to be held at the common currency, many believe that the European project was too far.
The euro crisis has little to do so that national governments cause excessive budget deficiencies – that was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has set up its members on exchange rates that are advantageous for German exporters, and it would like to allow German politicians so.
Without the possibility of assessing the local currency, South Europe will return to Germany with an integrated productivity share.
The only possibility is to shorten the expenditure and public expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
Among the current state and currency problems, the European productivity problem is a deepest stage.
As a result of the green energy directives adopted by Brussels – a code for the subsidiation of French and German energy undertaking on consumer costs – the European industry compares the double for electricity and the fourth stages for gas.
This is a fair expenditure, as we could see in Grangeouth.
The European Petrochemical Industry does not protect all the loans in the world because it is unlike to be moved from a bill of American steel gas to the edge.
As a result, a revolt, especially in France, is the only Chief Chief of the EU.
After the war, the EU's political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany was shocked and was able to have Paris highlighted with Washington.
But Berlin does not need Paris more than a port for political legitimation and has expressed its own economic policy to combat the French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pens, the EU-Finish Front National, has just won a decisive seal and so the government socialists had three places.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the election votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot be able to get out of it, a disclosure in the right spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the link.
What does Le Pen make with her new popularity among the white French of the worker class?
She wants to use the EU choice in the next year to reduce a EU anti-EU, anti-Community block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties are well dismissed in these elections, and it is very well possible, then the European Parliament could first dominate this block.
This is the point I want to be further: in the future, the growing residue against the EU and the common currency will be accompanied to decrease the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be something more like the “Europe of the (sovereign) nations, the General de Gaulle.”
Germany and a few of its satellite companies may be fixed on the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I hope that Britain's project is disappeared in the hope of joining the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific Area is nearly that the United Kingdom will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where's Skotland?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which is also listening to tell Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I am glad that Scotland could be well done in a more locker European association, if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similar countries is easier in a non-food Europe of the nations.
On the other hand, we should consider the same thing as Norwegia and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, notably, the most successful political movement against the Space Policy in Europe and has obtained a more spectacular majority because of the rejection of the proposed (and proposed) rates responsible for the Minister of Labour Finance and the following Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be funny for Skotland to decide for an independence now only to obtain a sphere from Berlin and Brussels.
Previous Puberty: Previous Adults
African and Spanish girls tend to achieve the puberty more than their white age girls, such as research.
Physical changes do not mean the puberty not directly
There is no evidence that hormone or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic fertility is a detriment of the early puberty
The trend to early puberty is less expressed in kids
The former CNN Correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialized on child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows in the age of seven or eight years of breast and hair?
At the annual conference of the Child Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these previous physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and made a new standard.
“I have a lot of time to calm your parents – normally it is no sign that the puberty is now slowly entering the puberty.” Kaplowitz explained.
Evident development displays, such as growing breasts, skins, axles, and body smells, are shown in girls early.
However, in the past 40 years, there was only a slight movement in the age of Menarch (exhibition of the first rule).
In the United States, the average age of 12,5 years is at least 12,75 in 1970.
“When the breast’s development begins, it is at least two to three years to menarch,” said Caplowitz, also the author of the book “Freue Pubertate in girls: the essential advisor to handle with this common problem.”
Time is the most precise test, as the puberty advances.
It is reverse, which actually represents the start of the puberty, but it is “frodef” if the breast increase is accompanied before a age of eight years.
In most cases, the process is slow or stagnated – something that can observe a child physician accurately.
The tests may be shown by an indicators in order to exclude serious problems such as tumor or cysts.
There are treatment methods to delay an early mestruction and the decline of other consequences: the premature age of skins, the finally to increase growth and thus a small body consumption in adults.
Recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are aimed at the age of the child, the development speed, the growth rate and the emotional rif.
Psycho-social aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is declining in what is medically, but he emphasizes: “The pressures of the puberty may smooth behavior problems and the feelings of girls, other than being their older girls.”
The other big problem is comprehensive: parents simply don't want to want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They are careful for the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienical side,” said Kaplowitz.
“ It was a shock,” remembers a woman who received her daughter with ten days.
Even if there was the first sign and we had spoken about menstruction, it was not emotionally prepared.
She was shocked and shocked from school to home because she was the first in her friendship.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there are no fair evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages were originally in the media.
Kids come like girls before in the puberty.
Caplowitz is the view that the most convinced press is the epidemic of fativity.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls under six to nine years of age, which produces a relationship between body feed and involvement in the puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African and Spanish girls tend to reach the puberty more than their white friends.
There are different statements for this.
Global seems to have an early puberty of all possible things to be influenced by economic conditions regarding climate to genes.
Another race: Despite the skin and sharp breathing, the trend is not expressed as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stress the complexity of the topic.
The visit of acne and shamhaar is distributed at children and kids.
“We must be careful about how we identify the true start of the puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be able to consult their children’s doctors as they should talk to their children.
"This can mean that you have to conduct a conversation before you are expected," Kaplowitz replied.
If you stay quiet, the child normally reacts well.
Girls who flee early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it enters before.
Jumbo manufacturers strive in the face of large orders on seat width
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, it has been an interview on the width of seats in the tourist class at long-street flights, which leads to the sound for a worse convergence on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The strike turns to the seat width that passengers will be offered at long flights in the tourist class – not always those to work on airlines mostly, but this exhibited room represents the key for the effectiveness of the flights of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co..
Airbus requested a sector standard of at least 46 cm (18 cm) in the tourist class this week, but the US-American Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The counterparty is at a time since the aircraft manufacturers will continue to sell larger versions of their two motorcycle flowers, and expects record contracts from 17 to 21 November.
As the back part of the flight has been exhausted – in particular whether there are rows with nine or ten seats –, it is crucial for the economic results specified that the new “Mini Jumbo” design should be delivered.
Boeing said that his modernized “777X” phase 406 people were at the seats of the tourist class, which are widely wide than 17 dolls and allows ten per series.
Airbus states that the competitive version of the A350 transported 350 people in 18 customs large sites in the tourist class, with nine per series.
Aircraft advertising often shares hibe on technical details using advertising in the special pressure.
Now calls Airbus before Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with more than 100 orders will predict the pension, directly to the public.
The company recently showed a statement that could be the beginning of a new war and showed a image of money in which three people sit in a restaurant, and thus the title: “Do you accept it?”
“Boeing proposes long-stretch flights in seats that are closer than regional Turbo props,” says the head of Airbus, John Leahy.
In view of changed food habits, people will be sweet, but airlines have not changed radically.
Among the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-term trip, and at the end of the century, the weight of the male medium-Americans between 40 and 49 years has increased ten percent, so the data of the United States Ministry of Health.
The number of men's average company in the 21th century is 100.8 cm of American health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival was a seat approach from the 1950s when the average body size of the fresh baptized “Jet Set” was worse.
You have conducted research, so Airbus, that an additional custom (2.54 cm) per sit increased the quality of sleep at 53%.
Boeing controls the numbers of Airbus to the seats and says that it is not to decide how aircraft companies build the balance between aircraft and plant.
The company also declares that, according to the investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“Indeed, it is really the way to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they need to think to be successful,” explains Kent Craver von Boeing.
They don't want us to deal with what they do.
You know her business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is more freedom of shipping, but the manufacturer will, in growing measure, be a subject that can affect the channels.
A loan for aircraft orders is estimated by at least 700 billion US dollars on list prices in the coming decades, which could affect the export balance of the United States or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seatlayout is the driving power behind the counterparty towards the new jets.
Even Airbus as well as Boeing 20% more efficiency per sit were at its latest two motors long-stretch designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-six boeing 77-300ER.
The statements on the results are partly depending on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per series with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per serie.
“There are more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive to our products,” says Kevin Keniston, director for passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts said that fully-complete cabins with ten seats per series in existing 777s suggested that many passengers decided for the closer order, which could be taken with more suitable aircraft.
“The eight dog width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat by the 777," says Mary Kirby, experts for cabin plants, founders and exhibitors of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing does not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The favorable Jet salers have even a band-measuring measure in order to comply with the competitiveness.
Even if they reach the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-scale exhibition for flying and regional flights.
Airbus offers a A350 with ten-six lines, but has not been sold in its own speech.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of being more adjustable to the kitchen and offered wide seats to the gates.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call will probably be polluted after a new sector standard, but it could be possible for the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotin impairment could make the grain when smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-Nichotin immune that could destroy the enjoyment of smoking.
One single dose of the vaccine could protect a life before nicotine shock.
Before tests, further trials are needed, which can take some years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tested all methods available on the market, but they had to experience that their nicotine demand is stronger than these approaches” says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmful virus that has been changed so that it contains the genetic information on the manufacture of nicotin antibodies.
The virus is selectively infected by the lever cells that then produce a permanent electricity of antibodys.
The antibodies capture the nicotine molcules in the blood and neutralize the brain before they reach the brain, where a smoker does not result in nicotin high.
In trials, imposed skins that were administered by Nikotin contributed to their normal activity level.
Nevertheless, museums would have taken a “time”, the researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiences are described in the Sechblatt Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tabac vaccines failed because they received anti-organismes.
The vaccines had to be given so often that they were costly and unpractic.
But the costs of the new vaccine are probably significantly lower because it transforms lever cells into anti-organisme manufactures.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be for humans if he is very sure that children are shocked before they tried to try to try to smoke, and thus prevent nicotine search.
But it's likely that smokers would use him to stop.
“They know that when they start to smoke again, they will no longer be comfortable because of the nicotin vaccine, and that helps them to stop the habit," he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time they warned that it was still necessary for further research.
Tripodi controlled to be influenced by Obeid
The former Minister of Labor-Partie Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is conducted by the public corruption oversight.
The former NSW ministries decided to have changed maritime passing arrangements on request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, which was engaged in three substances on publicly controlled country.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) has extended its investigations on Friday, whether Obeid has influenced different state ministers in this way, pay contracts at Circular Quay, where the Occupieds operate two restaurants and a coffee, without extending the record after their expiration in August 2005.
Now it was identified because of the accused, Tripodi had a clear interest in the baselines after Tripodi had spent in accordance with Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
In the years of the 2005 discussions, the Government had launched public accounts for the aid contracts.
The Palestinians, however, wanted longer periods.
2009, the payment contracts for the Circular Quay companies, which introduced the Occupy annually $2.5 million, have been extended without public explanation.
Tripodi, Minister of Haven from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally expressed for public posts.
However, he agreed to have made the amendments on requests of Obeid, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had reversed the aid schemes of the Government.
One of the ICAC telephone records showed discussions from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading official who had been changing to the Headquarters, after he worked under Occupy in the fishing authority.
“What is the theme discussed in this phone conversation the development of commercial depayment schemes?” asked the representative Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No” said Tripodi.
I can't remember what was talked, but it was not definitely.
Indeed, not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighting fleet target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli Jagd flights had attacked a target in the Syrian port Latakia, confirmed a leading government employee against Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the objective was, but said that it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, it was aimed at Russian SA-125 rakets.
At least twice this year, Israel has performed air shock deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457-vises could be subjected to “reality test”
The Government is thinking of a ‘reality test’ for foreign workers with 457-visual views.
If the test is introduced, it is a criteria for the use of which is to prevent the use of 497 unqualified jobs or as a door for access to families and friends to Australia.
Today, a proposal of the Government was published after the previous deputy of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, was condemned by the government's comments on foreign workers, because they could be able to be disfellowshipped by the neighbors of Australia.
“Authorical statements such as, countries must be set down below” and, first, Australian are a very poor decline in times in which workshops requested a protected labour market,” she said today to the Australian India Institute.
The historical consideration was that white work forces should be protected – and if some in the region a echo of this historical art, it would not be wonderful.
The proposal for a debate includes 12 measures, which were first considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in charge of the last conversation on human mud in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes that others will still be resolved.
If the ‘reality criteria’ is accepted, a person may therefore be examined if “the application is true in the cases where the applicant is associated with the holder or a person concerned with the supporting company”.
The company could also be obliged to derogate the number of 457 visa contents after the past undertakings who first wanted to support only a small number of employees have established hundreds of people.
Instead, a 35-year-old sri-lank asylum probably died at a heart-infarction, when he arrived with a refugee boat on Christmas island this week.
The nine-year-year-old son of the man who came with him after Australia will be employed from an adult cousin who was also on the ship since his father died in the midnight.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study was announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 Railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to implement high speed connections between Scotland and North England with the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project “It will be closer to the United Kingdom”.
The Scotia Minister of Transport explained that he was very pleased to work with the British government at this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high speed connection between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2 is completed, it will be given connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated costs for the construction of high speed Strategy between London and Northern England of 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is in discussion with the Scotland Transport, has been able to find HS2 Ltd after further road capacity and travel time improvements for Northern Greece and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of traveling time last three hours or less than Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a real national strike network, the United Kingdom and its cities are closer.”
We go forward with HS2 because it brings great advantages to us.
Without it, we're in our station before a capacity crisis.
However, it is also the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved by HS2.
The Scotch State Secretariat Alistair Carmichael commented: “The advertising today is a good news for Skotland.”
On behalf of the Scotiaan government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for “uncomingly” to join the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high speed connection gives the potential of great economic advantages for Scotland, but also provides the economic power of Scotlands a argument for rapid rail connections in the whole of the United Kingdom.”
Therefore, we are pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to investigate the options for high speed connection in Scotia, creating the advantages for all and complement the link Glasgow-Edinburg, which already plants the Scotia government.
I am glad to examine the research report with the British Ministers in the next year and to decide the following steps together.
Rules on electronic devices in aircraft remain provisional in Australia
Australian passengers must also continue to stop tablets and phones when they start and load, despite efforts in the United States to lock the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US flights to change their offers so that passengers can be read or played on their devices during critical flight phases E-Books, see or play videos, provided that they are located in the flight mode.
During the majority of the flight, passengers are already allowed, but there are many people who do not have to read their e-books when they start and load.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement the United States-American airlines unwanted work, however, no immediate plans for amending their rules are required.
The CaSA Aviation Insurance also declared that the announcement would be regarded, but stressed that the restrictions in the use of electronic devices in critical airlines in Australia are applicable.
“The CSA has now not given specific arrangements on the use of electronic devices in the airport”.
The topic is subject to provisions which, according to the safety of airlines, the security of airlines must be maintained at any time and the passengers shall follow the security instructions given by the cobine personnel.
Virgin has already conducted discussions with the CASA on an extensive use of its WiFi maintenance systems and explained that it is open for changes, but it should be initiated by the legislator.
“We would be grateful to a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by the CASA, as we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after offering (freely entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas declared that you will continue to remain further under the current rules.
“Our current directives provide that electronic devices should not be used when starting and loading, and we do not have any plans to change,” explained the company.
The FAA rules apply to US-American airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in arrangements which can benefit passengers, and the decision of the FAA and the reasons for this will certainly be considered exactly.
The decision is different from the US-American society after the age of the Flotte.
They must prove that their aircrafts can tolerate functional disorders through mobile devices, and handbooks, training materials, handback programs and customer information.
“A flight company has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, they can passe the use of more tragable, easier electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones,” reported the FAA.
In rare cases in bad view, the crowd is shown the passengers while the loading stops the devices.
The group also recommends that more harder devices should be safely under the seat or in the seats.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, the best BVB attachers were shocked with light races for skin scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund proclaimed the heartfelt consequences.
Before the freeday game of football football liga against the VfB Stuttgart, Ultras reacted first with a swimming -.
It was an inhabited, almost scenetic accustic, which took place to the viewer until a short prior to the approximation of the Federal Link Game between the German Vice-Marian Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
The guest fans were overall with their seeds.
The Southern Tribunes, where the most faithful - and most true - are BVB fans, first appeared to be extraordinary: No songs, no battle calls.
The power of the Capo, who, in other words, coordinated the common injury, remained unplaced.
And in front of the tribune, a large fahne with a record "Stadio prohibition".
Only as Torus Roman Weidenfellers, as always as the first BVB players, burned a short-term jubel.
When his mature colleagues followed, there was a skin and shocked shoes - but it was not long all over.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the Southern Tribune, there was nothing.
Also that Stadion speaker Norbert Dickel once again counted the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, win about Arsenal, Proliferation of Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not care for holiday laune.
Before five minutes before the capo's appointment, the power of the capo was shocked - and the slightly shocked up with the hands, as a shock, as a Dickel, as the smiling habited on the rounds in the stadium.
As last, the Southern Tribune was like always at the series - and finally it was back here as the most common place in the stadium.
And the late time with appeal from the South Tribune, "Derbysinger stands up" came back, it was all back as always.
The skin before was probably a reaction to the events of the last days.
Unmediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the most attractive BVB boards were shooted into the sighting rings and on the place - and almost the shooters of Roman Weddingfeller took place.
The game was late accepted because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the spots of the villagemunder Ultra in his office - and it was believed that Watzke's words, which was a very unfair term for the fellow believers.
"It will be given massive inputs for the whole Ultra movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday at a podium debate in Frankfurt.
As a immediate measure, Watzke underlined Ultras a choreographic for home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I'm prohibited," he explained.
The null tolerance policy in pyrotechnology is not possible.
Furthermore, Ultra has shown different possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday this is time to decide for one.
In other words, as Watzke, the BVB will set a sanction until the end of the next week.
"This will be shocking", secured Watzke .
You may be shocked how the reactions in the south of the Tribune are defeated.
Pfand houses trees in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle level
In a pound house in the Bendemer Center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga has a golden army, a ring and a couple of earrings in order to pay the school costs of her daughters.
“My husband and I just purchased a house, where my whole money is in there,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she won 3.000 Singapore Dollar (ca 1.730 euros) as an administrative employee, and her husband also worked, the monthly family income does not explain.
Indeed, the demand in South Asian parts – where the debt increased – is so large that valueMax, where it has made her bath, has been the third Pfundd House that has been learned at the Singapore Burse.
The loan of smuck is not only a fast way to get money – 1.300 Singapore Dollar in case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as good as an insured bank loan.
Typically, a effective annual year in Singapore requires a local creditor with a filial in the same purchasing center for over 15.4 percent.
However, Pfandhouses provide the advantage that there is no revision of creditability or income necessary, as soon as possible in banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are employed in the Pfand houses after the pressure of the familys by increased living costs and increased budget and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and strict creditors because of a more locked financial policy in the developed economic spaces, families are looking for lower and medium-term income to compare the difference in terms of heat.
This week, the Rating Agency of Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly by increased hypotheks, was a risk factor for the creditability of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia as regards Brutto Inland product after assessing the Agency.
Malaysia has 80 per cent of the GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 per cent even in 2008.
People's economics also care for high consumer debt in Thailand, which has resulted in a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued export deficiency and a leave of consumer demand.
“The final effect means that, in view of the increased costs, people will be trying to complement their income in the middle to lower segments (the income scale) where it is possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economic CIMB, a mathematician bank.
The historical maximums of gold prices in the past two years have still increased the trend to consumption of personal objects, since people use the opportunity to transform the smoke of the family in bargeld.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the packed objects are in the 200 pound houses of the city's gold state.
The people say, "The gold price looks good, let our grandmother's gold chain bear and return the next month."
The largest Thai pind householder, EasyMoney, has experienced 20 percent of customers in its filials in the last months.
The growth in the plant business is so strong that ValueMax, Philadelphialers in Bendemeer and 15 other in Singapore, not only want to expand in the nearby Malaysia – where the company has four houses – but also outside Asian, so Yes Lee Ching, business leader of ValueMax.
The company is funded by 60% of the 66 million Singapore Dollars who took it this week with the burdengang in Singapore.
While some creditors were covered for high interest rates in the crossfire, Yes states that the Pfandhouses did not only offer more interest than other suppliers, but also not directly increased the debt.
“The clients have objects that they have already, and the flowing personal values does not increase the budget distortion,” she explains.
The financing of funds will be accepted in society as a short-term, secure financing.
Neither are all people who use the fifty feed in financial difficulties.
The rich people from Singapore also come in the branches of ValueMax to spend gold bars and rolex bures, for which they get up to 60% of the buy price in bar.
To us customers from every social stage.
“This includes the prosperity of a short-term business or investment, or small enterprises that have to be overcome in the Cash Flow,” says Yes.
Sometimes they just need very fast money.

Saving package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanic Health
The Australian government is in the hard conditions linked to the saving package of more than $325 million for Tasmanian health in order to ensure that the Government of the State is not able to spend money.
The Federal Health Minister, Tanya Plibersek, has announced that the Commonwealth will be taken “indirect measures” to abide a crisis caused by an older population of the island, a higher quota to chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tajik Member Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has established a emergency rescue package, which is our view to the unique challenges regarding the state of the state,” states today.
The 325 million dollars package includes $31 million immediate assistance for selection services.
More than 2600 operations, including Orthopaedian invasions and treatments for green stars, are to be removed.
Furthermore, there are money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better insurance after stationary stay, special training, psychological health services and the introduction of an electronic system for registration of health data in local hospitals.
“This investment corresponds to the ideas of which clinical workers I have said they are the best possibility to improve the Tasman health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister was a strict reporting and accountability of the Tajik Government.
The State should keep the current level of financing to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where additional money was issued.
A three-first Commission is established and is intended to ensure that the State's health services provide as effective and effective as possible.
As Wilkie today stated, the $325 million would only be useful if “not be accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course. ”
Despite this, he loving the Government that she had reacted on his request for urgent assistance he had first expressed towards the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I am convinced that federal aid will contribute to the public health system of the State,” said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these election services will be widely competitive.
However, the health policy speakers of the opposition at Federal level, Peter Dutton, is the view that today's announcement is only a 'plaster solution'.
“We are now in the situation because the Labour Government has deleted $430 million from the health system,” he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a State government takes about a half billion dollars from the system and shoots the Commonwealth 300 million and then do as the good news.
Duton asked to ensure that none of the single dollar of the saving package will be issued for additional officecracy.

Syria has destroyed its possibility to produce chemical weapons, so a supervisory group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gas munitions, declared the global supervision group for chemical weapons on Thursday, while it came to severe confusions in the north of the country near one of the places where there is probably giftous substances.
At the same time, on Thursday, a Syrian aktivist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war is now three years ago.
The proclamation of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the end
1 November, which was established by Damaskus in Den Hague to destroy or “inoperable” all facilities for the production of chemical weapons, including all machines for the mixture of chemical gas and the fulfilment of munitions.
The end of this process, which is based on the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone stone of an ambitionated time plan which is aimed at the destruction of all the chemical weapons of Syria to mid-2014.
The destruction of the plants means that Syria cannot produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still begin to destroy the existing weapons and equipment.
As a result, there are some 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including Senfgas and the Nervengas Sarin.
The proclamation came at a time when on Thursday, fighting in the city of Safira, the experts said that there was a production plant for chemical weapons and building cities, as the Syrian Obsession for Human Rights reported in Britain.
The active group, who persecuted the number of dead by a network of activeists in Syria, declared that on Thursday, 120.296 people died.
There were 61.067 civilians, including 6.365 children.
On the side of the government, the army of Bashar Assad was 29.954.
At the same time, there were 2.202 armed data and 5.375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated until now.
The conflict has forced about two million people to run out of the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels from which many links to al-Qaida groups have been linked.
The Observer said that it had given losses on Thursday on both sides, but not called details.
The fights understood the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors have been exposed, since their mission to release Syrians from its gifting weapons scenario is a ransom against the time in the midst of a civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is closely cooperating with the United Nations, it is “unconvinced that all of them have seen important production and mix and compliance institutions mentioned by Syria and have lived with their destruction”.
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are planned at this time”.
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors declared that they had closed the first round of the reviews and visited 21 of 23 of the places specified by Damascus.
As security concerns were not possible, the inspectors said that the visit was not possible.
On Thursday, the OPWC declared that the two positions were ‘inspected’ according to the Syrian statement, and the objects that existed in the chemical weapons programme were displaced to other plants identified.
It was not immediately clear whether the place in Safira was one of the two institutions that could not visit OPCW inspectors.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
“I have shown the hot before the tapness and the courage you all showed when you have completed the most urgent mission carried out by this organization”, explained Ahmed Useumcu, Director-General of the Supervisory Organization in a comment published by OPCW.
Since three years of struggle, the Sunnitic Muslim Reserves in this civil war against the Assad's government and their security forces, who have heard many of the Al-Alawis members, have been dismissed by the Sheriff.
With regard to further developments, the leader of the Observer Group, Rami Abdurrahman, gave it a strong explosion in a air defence institution in the Syrian Coast Province Latakia.
The cause of explosion is not known, he explained.
Honour of condemnation for bombs at Bali
The survivors and associates of the 202 people who had lived in 2002 at the bomb attack in Bali were reacted to the sentence for the last of the lawyers who had been sentenced before the court, as Umar Patek should be able to shoot their views in a legal manner.
Patek, who was just ten years old as one of the most popular people of South America, was sentenced to his role on the construction of shooting bodys for the bomb attack for a 20-year prison penalty.
He could be dismissed after 15 years of punishment.
The 45-year-old murder was found by the mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist town of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more injured.
In a number of terrorist attacks, a debtor was also conducted in a number of terrorism-related cases, with a wave of smuggling demands on churches in Indonesia in 2000.
The State Authority had requested a long-term prison penalty, even if it was also called “Demolition Man” for the man who had been sentenced to death.
The decision has deceived painful memories at June Courten, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old trillionist Jane and Jenny in the convictions established by Patek and his competitors almost ten years ago.
She said that Patek should have been sentenced for death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy.
“It should be sent to him before a shooting command,” said the Court against AAP.
I have to live every day so I won't get any more angel and I will never see my daughters anymore.
The Sari Club was similar to the earthquake, as, on 12 October 2002, a powerful bomb was explosed in a small laster that was parked before the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar where only 20 seconds ago a suicide murderer made an exploded rucksack full of pollutant.
After the attack, he fell into the coma and the “Sterb” three times, while he went to a life conservation system.
Hughes said that Patek had the same sack as the three other members of the terrorist Jemaah Islamia – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbad and were established four years ago.
Indeed, this guy should be sentenced to death before all others.
Let him live – no, there's no reason to leave him alive.
20 years after he killed 202 people and many hundreds of people, it's not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomb that was before the court.
He took off about a decade of prison, but finally in January 2011 in the Pakistanian city Abbottabad, where the US troop forces killed the previous al-Qaida-Chef Osama bin Laden for about four months.
During the negotiation, a FBI agent said that secret services reports had shown that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin loads with the objective to rebuild the connection between South-Tasian terrorism groups and al-Qaida.
“He did not stand up,” said the Courten.
Until recently, he has not shown ridicule about how much he had added to others.
It was sentenced before the ten-year-old anniversary of the attack in this year, which will begin with memories in Bali and Australia.
“ It will give many tears this year, ” said the Courtes.
Patek may be invoked against his sentence and professional.
FAA: flights can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but no phone talks)
A flight driver can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, music and use the look of films, but not call with the phone, so the new directives issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect that these amendments are implemented immediately.
As soon as they would be implemented, notwithstanding the aircraft company, the FAA-member Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
The FAA has to demonstrate that aircrafts are in accordance with the new directives and that they have updated the training books of the aviation staff and the arrangements for the transmission of the devices in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to build the use of tragable electronic devices in aircraft.
Both these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“We could soon accept the extensive use of electronic devices according to the state of the plan”, known by the FAA in a relief.
Currently passengers must be disabled by smartphones, tablets and other devices when closing the aircraft doors.
They can start again when the aircraft has reached a height of three miles (3 km) and the captains have green light.
When the aircraft is entered into the country, the passengers must stop them again and shall not start again before the flight is entered.
According to the new directives, aircraft companies whose aircrafts are safeguarded against electronic disorders could allow their passengers to use the devices also when starting, loading and on the rolling field, explained the FAA.
The criteria should be complied with most of the new vehicles and other flights that have been converted to the use of Wi-Fi in larger heights.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Aviation Association, welcomed the amendments.
“If the new arrangement is safely implemented – and we work closely with the aircraft – will benefit both sides of it," commented Glading.
We are honestly sorry that we have to feel like supervisors in this issue.
However, Internet connections continued to be prohibited to survey, exchange e-mails, text messages or download data under three kilometers, explained the authority.
Passagers are requested to move smartphones, tablets and other devices in the flight mode.
Thus, no “Words With friends” is the similar online game that the player Alec Baldwin in 2011 played on his smartphone when he had to leave a Jet of American Airlines publicly because he refused to stop the device while the flight was parked on the flight.
And worse devices such as laptops must also be refined, since there is an injury drive where they fly through the cabin.
Phone conversations during the flight remains also prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone discussions is at the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.
FAA may have prohibited certain electronic devices when starting and loading
Last month Mark Rosenker said that the National Transport Security Board, Security Experts for National Transport Questions on CBS News, would still be considered as a risk.
“Handy is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential disasters to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission of the air can also defeat sensors”, says Rosenker.
A Committee of Auditors, called by the FAA to investigate this topic, recommended last month that the government permits a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to switch restrictions for use.
Criticals such as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri are the view that it does not provide a valid security basis for the ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly being implemented because the use of the devices has become worthy.
In some studies, the speech is forgotten or ignored until a third of the passengers.
The FAA began 1966 to limit the use of electronic devices by flights, after reports on disruptions of navigation and communication devices by passengers, which were then known by the UKW radio that represented the latest technology.
New aircraft are wisely more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircrafts, but they are also built as well as by the FAA that they do not make any electronic interferences.
Airlines offer passengers for some years with Wi-Fi when the airline is reached.
The flowers adjusted to Wi-Fi systems are also unlikely against interferences.
The overwhelming majority of passenger flights should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices in accordance with the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally give less functional radiation than previous generations.
For example, e-relator only gives a minimum radiation if you are slaughtered.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are increased.
The packaging of the limits for the use of the device by passengers is Amazon.com.
2011, undertaking employees made a passenger flight full of children e-related and made a test flight to detect problems, but they couldn't find it.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings relating to the risk of the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd, from the National Association of Airline Passengers, said that it is the view that disorders are real by the devices even if the risk is minimum.
Other committees said that it was only aligned reports of pilots that were cut by the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to order the switch of the devices through the passengers in the instrument landing.
A grouping from the travel sector welcomed the changes and called them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who had been fully equipped with technology today.
“We are glad that the FAA recognises that a good passenger experience is not in the reaction to security,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the United States Travel Association.
Reserved birds Reliable for Air Safety Service of North Sea-Bohr Island
A per aircraft service at the coast of flight birds, which was found on a North Sea Island, was returned to the nature.
The water rail was fled in the last month with a heavy snake to Aberdeen, where it was shocked by the Scotic Animal Protection Organization SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, Head of the Centre, said: “This water rail was probably a winter ship from Northern Europe, which was held by the strong wind over the North Sea.”
Apparently the created bird was looking for refugee on the Bohr Island.
He added: “He couldn’t go further, because we were contacted with the request to help. ”
When it was released, the water rail was refined and healthy.
Is Europe's Elite ready to do business with British?
Business for British has been launched in April with the desire to bring the economy to a table and to define what to change our relationship with the EU in Britain.
To this end, we have undertaken the largest and comprehensive investigation among British industry leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov asked more than 1.000 leadership forces from the economy, which, in particular, forms British business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be surprised.
We have found that the overwhelming majority of enterprises exported outside Europe and focused on countries that modernize and grow, while the countries are stagnating in the EU.
They wish to promote new trade connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil, instead of maintaining the long and emphasis process to reform obsolete EU institutions.
In view of certain legally regulated topics – from the law to the product legislation –, the majority of the economic leaders consider that the control of these key competences should be recovered to West Minster.
It was generally inadequate for the internal market, since the costs of the Brussels rules would exceed the benefits of being part of the Europe's trade zone – even 40 per cent of the major enterprises, which are traditionally most in Europe.
Finally, and it may say mostly, our survey of industrial leaders made that a clear majority of Britain wishes to change the agreement and a relationship with the EU, which is based on trade, is not on policy.
This recognition, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading concentrations, shows that the economy is a “excellent change” which brings the deal of trade back to Britain.
It is very much – a change in the agreement and better conditions for the United Kingdom would lead to 16 percent to a change in views for the remaining in the EU in a people.
The Prime Minister should not have doubts: this survey shows that the British economy is under its plan for the new negotiations of the British Conditions for the EU membership.
It also shows that enterprises from a new negotiation expect a clear movement of power relations to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and is increasingly necessary after the euro zone moves towards a closer economic and physical unity.
The priority must be of employment and growth in Britain, as the result of our survey shows, what means a strengthened attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach for rules.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom called Pipeline in Bulgaria as the start of a new gas
The early construction of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria represented the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom priority.
“The present event is a milestone: the construction work at the South Stream Gaspipeline section, the largest and most important project in Europe, has started", said the Chairman of Gazprom, Alexie Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the whole European continent.
South Stream is intended to ensure more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
An agreement between Gazprom and its pensioners in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas for Europe is launched, ensures a increased risk of conventional routes as to be heard by official sides.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, said that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “forever excluded”.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas to benefit from South Stream when the whole project operates in 2015.
According to Gazprom, the construction work is to start on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is equipped with an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of gas.

Listen to the King's Commission: two MYCA employees in the case of accused against Jonathan Lord for sexual crimes
Two MYCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual crimes in relation to children, before 2011, against the children's employer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children.
However, in the opening declaration before the Commission, the MYCA had stated that it had never been done in the organization with a case of sexual abuse of children.
The director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a MYCA employee was accused of behaviour with child pornography, and another in which a sportor of the MYCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 was sentenced to him because of the abuse of her children.
Hare said, Gail Furness, one of the Commission assisting lawyers, that he had known in the first case, but not the second.
He said that the opening declaration of the MYCA against the Commission had also been clearly noted, “he has given external reviews of the MYCA, where the MYCA was recognised as the front front in child security.”
Proofs before the Commission show that the MYCA has been informed that he has received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit from the Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at MYCA, was a slowness that the business guided the "of me to decline" in the position of the Lord and did not make sure that workers had been clearly informed of the violations against the directives on child safety.
Lord was sentenced to his two-year-old activity for the MYCA in the beginning of the year because of sexual abuse to 12 boys.
He was sentenced at least six years of prison.
However, it concludes that the MYCA had a cultural problem that the employee has stopped reporting Lord's violations regarding the security of children.
The employees said they had observed crimes, among others, that the Lord was alone with children, she was private to be a baby sister, left her on his shooting, said to one that he loved it, and left children playing with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose Lord was and who had requested for training for child protection, because she was concerned about his conduct, said that the Chief Chief of Chief Jacques Barnat, who was the Lord of the MYCA Caringbah, was “a very shockful and the most closest time.”
The business manager stated that he would not accept statements from employees, as they did not wish to make their report.
Instead, as he said, their friendship with the Lord has influenced their powers of judgment, for they had not reported him.
Hare declared that he had informed the leadership of MYCA NSW that the lesson that the organization was to take into account the "Jonathan-Lord Case" was “not the report” by employees and the body agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to delay employees to sign secret obligations shortly after the accusation, is taken by the manager of the Chief Child Services of MYCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that it should be prevented by contamination of evidence, but what has been “extinct and badly implemented”.
The MYCA NSW was at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, no safe organization for children, explained Professor Stephen Smallbone from the Griffith University, experts for sexual abuse, the Commission.
He explained that it had given “precise problems” in setting, review, processing, training and monitoring of the employees.
The hearing was declared until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the opportunity to return as the British Prime Minister – but it's not likely to be a comeback.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his divorce from the Office, the 59-year-old girls announced his views on different internal policy issues.
Since his retreat in June 2007 after a decade of State head Blair, Blair has widespread avoided expressing the British policy, and its comments are mostly limited to the foreign policy and its role as a Senator of the Quartet of Peace at the Middle East.
On the question whether he would like to return to the office of the Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: “Yes, sure, but it is unprotected that this happens, so ..."
When the horses of horses in shadows in Cardiff were entered to cover the horse of the year, they knew that a hard competitive fight was favoured.
But no one was prepared for the three years of Fenton Kirkland.
The snippe, which wasn't once in the child garden and made his first steps just a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee was lockered through the three rounds and bought the first price – where they left 30 adult enemy behind themselves.
The uncertain couple, both large, has been promised for their events, behaviors and styles during the annual competition, which is organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he was in competitiveness against men and women with elegant melones, he had set his tears into a fresh round and led the two years old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was buried by the jury for his natural abilities when he interfered with the Pony, who slowed over his age.
And Tofe received the good notes for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift to his third birthday and has been working every day with the Shetland Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a great shock.”
They had to arrive against the whole part of the field and went out of the place with gold pokal and Rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated with Toffee in a competition, and we were all encouraging when he won.
Full foreigners in the Arena took him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, followed in the footsteps of his tante Sharon Howells, who has been leading over ten years.
Howells told: “The whole public was like electricized and all have shooted and shooted him.”
He went to sand the whole length of the Arena, and although he was so angry, he did phantastic work.
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses, tractors and cold heights and has two hairs to care.
As he has been started, it will not be long until he is on the “Corde of the Year” school – and I am sure he's going to get off.
One speaker of the annual horsehold said, “Fenton is only three, but he knows how he must go with his pony.”
They're a great team together.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they were shocked and had been presented in the pre-guide.
They looked at good cooperation between Pony and leaders – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fentons's sweet clothing has contributed to its part, which's really perfect for the sweet.
The Chinese newspapers are aimed to be reformed after calling "reformed"
A Chinese newspaper requested the release of a reporter, who was accused of diffaming, was to be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The New Express in Guangzhou expressed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, in the television, Chen later acknowledged the applicant to false reports on a participatory company.
Now the New Expression will be subject to a “complete rectification”, explained the Rulesing Authority.
The ‘Reclaiming Regulation’ was received by the Authority for Press and Publications, radio, film and television in Guangdong.
Provisional investigations show that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several unacceptable reports on the office-notified company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The edition management of the New Express was unrelated” the regulatory authority was known in a statement.
She said you decided to “a administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and to remove him from his reporting license.”
Furthermore, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been stated to present a complete rectification of the New Expression and recommended to identify the relevant responsible persons in the new expression and immediately review the leadership team of the New Expression”.
Chen had written several items for the New Express in which he reported about adequate financial irregularities in a manufacturer of machines named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and posted his journalist work.
But then Chen opened in the state view and gave him that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have lost zoomleon as well as all the news industry and its ability to win the public trust," he explained against the public newspaper CCTV.
I did it first in line because I was out of money and silence.
I've been clear that I've been wrong.
The New Express published an apologic on the title page in the connection to Chens appointment and explained that you were swept to check the reports correctly.
A number of known suspects have recently been discovered in television convictions.
Experts say that acknowledgements are still routinely infringements, despite a change in legislation in the beginning of the year, in which the authorities were prohibited to force them to blame themselves.

One of the most raffined tunnels for the drug smoking between the United States and Mexico, which was completely equipped with shocking, swimming and electric swimming stations, has now been discovered.
The United States authorities describe the 120 times 90 centimeters of tunnel as one of the most fatal passengers they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the Zicksack Temple over a length of near six football fields, connects lager halls near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless unlikely unlikely layers, which makes it easier to hide with drugs shocked LKWs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unknownly, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, 8 tons of Marihuana and 148 kg of cocaine were assured, so the signs of the Court were signed.
Three men who worked as drivers, according to the statement of the authorities, were accused of the ownership and sale of Marihuana and Kokain.
You are threatened by a defence penalty between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, Smuggler places a comprehensive suburban network of design channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passenger found in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been found after the Marihuana experts in Central Mexico in October, which makes drug cards before the challenge how they can quickly bring their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passenger of about 640 meters long-term passengers with a kitchen in a household in Tijuana to two households in San Diego.

The shower Orlando Bloom has expressed himself to separate his wife, Topmodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Kuric, which should be extracted on Friday (Original time), Bloom said, "the life is sometimes not exactly as we plan or hope it."
Kerr and he still loved himself, stressed the 36-year-old boys.

The veganism, according to Lexika, is substantial to vegetarism, but is very different from this.
Because while vegetars are allowed to grant a sleeves, ices or a powerful edamer, these sleeves do not stand on the food map of a veganer.
Milk, skin, egg, in addition to the sight of meat and fish, the veganer can decrease from all the seeds of animal products - even the skin is destroyed.
What remains, it may be asked, but in closer consideration the veganal food world is expressed by a considerable accidental rise.
"Brot strikes are very popular", says Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the fascinating reform house, which provides a variety of special products for Veganer.
Reuben Proctor is also pleased to visit the load in the Domgase.
Since 13 years old, the new countries lived in Vegan, he (approximately) finds everything he needs to live. "1997 I took my food and became vegetar."
Over the centuries, the next step, and I became Veganer.
"But the conviction came not only because of the food but also because of the shooting," Proctor says, "the art sleeve is a normal leder.
He acknowledged that it was also in other daily interests without animal products.
First, Vegan is an ethical.
"I don't want the animals to die for me," Proctor says the Maximi of the Veganers, which are at the entire consumption.
Instead of retracing Burgers, routines or gummiberries, the Veganer quickly discovered completely new products, increased the shocking.
"It's a double bonus," Proctor says today, "in fact, vegan does not make it a skeeper, but it's a rangement." The acceptance that you reduce the selection of food options leads to the power of the habit.
And precisely, these conditions have also been able to cut some of the so-called attempts.
"The search factor is a very decisive factor that allows a lot of rapidly deleting, like in smoking," says Proctor.
And say: "A certain grain are not fixed in the animal."
Often there are the grains or the type of preparation that form the skin.
"But there can also be the same effect," the Veganer says.
For example, Proctor brings a few veghan beaches with the hotels, campignons, and also a few vegans.
It takes into consideration a balanced, slow-scale food, which should also be smelled at once.
Of course, you want to have something between the dents, that's legitimate.
"It should be smiling, but it is not only to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
Health damages to ess disorders, another broad-wide acceptance, did not experience.
For me, the transformation had a positive aspect.
I don't take foreign cholesterine and I have an increased vitamin quota.
There are high-performance substances that are only feeding vegan.
"My blood values are best, I often let me check", brings Proctor.
In particular, before the lack of vitamin B12, many vegansimus critics are warned.
"The animals with food products, instead of feeding on the weight, is questionable whether in the meat that you buy in the fridge strike, the quote of vitamin B12 is high", says Proctor.
For Veganer, it can also take the coenzym in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are okay," he says.
In the way, Proctor should not go for food purchase.
Food products are finally all and every supermarket has a medium-sized sojail and other products.
Everything I need, I find the place.
Just down and buy something special.
"My people believe that only the finished products are more money, but it is also known for "normal" pre-products."
Without prejudice to the preparation of vegan courts, it should be more favorable and less temporary than commonly accepted.
"In the kitchen there are lots to discover, with a few small bones you can be good if not partly get better results", says Proctor.
Margarine instead of Butter, a little more back powder and coal acid instead of egg, with its vegane kitchen, Proctor could also bring his swimming swimming powders to a surprise.
The Veganer gives a new distance.
This has a dynamic when you're buying together, it has a new value.
"The situations that can occur there are as different as people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was already skepsis.
Don't you mind my food again?
"I should feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions, you should act as veganer with finger paintings.
"I don't forget the people anymore, I am part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to fresh.
And more accurately, the world seems not to be so smoothed as a friend of the day - and the veganer does not be limited as commonly accepted.
Fast Food is also allowed.
There's a bomb over there!
"Mhild rounds offer flafels, or a vegetarian eufka", says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he spends on pasta rights, or orders a pizza without cook, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so late.
"If I started to feed me vegan 13 years ago, everything was much harder," the New York country can end up a development: "It must be talking to the people to take attention to them."
"When sufficient questions come, they may be obliged to add the food cards," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants are developed, for example, the combs in Manheim or the coffee bird free.
Proctor calls for the desire that other restaurants have at least a vegan court on the food card.
In fact, vegan courts are taken for all of them.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Fleish courts, however, are exclusive, in the true sense of the word, because they are closed otherwise," states Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food channels, then Veganism is a safe way to make the largest part of the previously impossible."
The purchase of vegan products could be a little hard at the beginning.
In particular, if you learn to understand, which can also contain animal additives as a colorer, it seems to leave rapidly with the follow-up of the ethics in so many gardens and cases of courage.
Not only Ruuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - animal contents and their alternatives" declares many ingredients that contain food, but also cleaning products.
"After and after developing a scanner view and know what signs and logs you have to be respected, "It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stay or to help," White Proctor.
The veganism, he is an important moral finger, which shoes on the consciousness.
Perhaps he does not completely make it possible to reprove his habits, but at least he can teach the consumers to ask his habits critically.

The British police decides to deliver Assange
The British police today has sent an extradition decision to WikiLeaks-Green Julian Assange, which searched for refugee in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard declared that you had the 40-year-old Australian 'related to take up', which requested him to appear in a police guard, and added, he shouldn't follow it, threatening the arrest.
Assange threatens the extradition to Swedish because of the complaint in a sexual crime after its possibilities are exempted under British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected its invoice against the expenditure in the beginning of the month.
He feared that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, and on June 19, he had searched for refugee in the London news and requested the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard said, “A 40-year-old man called for a police watch at one of us’s chosen time.”
He continues to defeat the conditions of his release to cupation.
The message did not comment on the appointment of the police.
Assange fears that it was issued by Sweden to the United States and was sentenced for possible sponsors after published over 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks website.

Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's Speculationsblase
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but it is still expected that the final decision by Mr George Osborne, who had linked a steel tax in the 2012 budget, had increased 7% of the households, more than two million dollars and annual costs for buyers, the apartments as a company and not individuals.
The income from the steel tax for housing in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which was located in the year 2012/13 at 708 million pounds, are now overcoming the solutions for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotia, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cookie said: “When the increases in steel tax on high prices and the introduction of related legislation against action can be severely taxed on high-quality realities, despite the impact of the common tax systems.”
“But this step could make some foreign investors decline in the purchase of real estate in London or to sell the owners” he added.
First-class real estate – the highest five to ten percent of the accommodation market by price – in the well-being London Southwestern garden, which spends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have deteriored the record value of 11,8 % in the last year.
The prices in Central London increased a equal growth of 5,6%, but were exceeded by an encouraging internal market, where the south-west part of the city, the North (7.4%) and the East (6.5%) experienced a survey of Savills.
Scientists were able to shine more light, in which the sweet world of a dog is with its smiling.
Previous research showed that happi dogs with the sweet were more to the right (of the vision of the dog) while it was the left side at nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can realize and react these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigar, a new scientist of the Trient University, said: “It is well known among people that the left and right brain half of the brain differently react on stimuli, which calls positive or negative emotions.”
We've been trying to see this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs the right brain was responsible for the movement of the left side, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the seed snake of their friends, the researchers observed the animals, while these films of other dogs.
They made the heart frequency of the four sides and analyzed the behaviour.
We probably will soon understand why the snake moves to one, once in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigar said: “We have shown the dog films with dogs – or a naturally faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate other aspects, and so we could control the movement of the snake more on the left or right."
When the animals saw how an unexpected dog moved the skin to the right (of the perspective of the swimming dog) they remained totally disappointed.
But predominantly the skin was left (or from the perspective of the dog that smells), and their heart frequency increased, and they looked uncomfortable.
According to Professor Vallortigar, the dogs do not communicate with each other through these movements.
He is more convinced that the dogs had learned from experience, in which movements they should be worried and when not.
He said: “When you have various contacts with other dogs and the weeds are connected to a direction more closer to friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences.”
The researchers say that the knowledge of dogs, animal doctors and trainers could help to understand better the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, experts for dog behaviour and guest-stipendiat at the University of Bristol University, explained that this was not the first study in which it was investigated whether the left and right dog is important.
Last year a team of Lincoln's university found that dogs turn the head to the left when they looked at a aggressive dog, and right if it is a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the university of Victoria in Canada, “does go to a robot dog, if it is the left, and not the right, instead of become unreasonable – precisely different than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore rise that the dogs in the various studies do not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study such as reacting dogs to real dogs could help, he explained.
“If there are considerable investments for many different skins that the two sides of the brain will be used for different purposes, but many of the details must still be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
However, as their behavior is simple, it will not be long until we understand why the skin sometimes moves to one, sometimes moves to another direction.

Papest Franciskus named the first cardinal in February
Pope Franciskus will first call on the Catholic Church's new cardinal, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinales are the highest classics in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are also one who chooses a pope, so that the first group of men will be called to be the first group of men, which will eventually be affected in the choice of his followers.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached a 80-year-old age is not to participate in the church election, which is to be a group of 120 “elected cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Pater Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said it will be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony will be held for the name of the new cardinal, also known as consistorium.
“Papst Franciskus has decided to predict his decision to introduce the consistry in February so that other meetings may be planned for the participation of cardinals from all the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of covenant cardinals will probably be cut up until February.
He declared that a pope normally renamed as many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of cooked cardinals retraced to 120, and so many cardinals over 80, as he wanted.
The consistry in the next year should therefore be declared because it is the first since the election of Franzisku in March this year, so Valero.
It is now a certain channel of Europe and, in particular, Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new Papest is called the rest of the world to restore the balance,” he said.
Four per cent of the Catholics live in South America, but they have only a variety of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first calling to find a group of eight cardinals from the whole world, who have the task of finding opportunities for reforming the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
“Nun has chosen this eight cardinal, which should help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was “good possible” that Franciskus would be asked for the Council.
But until now we were not in this situation - that's all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would call to cardinals, but it stands “a full surprise – we do not know who he is called.”
GM calls new pickup tricks in the United States to repair the seat loan
General Motors calls for 19.000 its brand-number Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Peckup Tricks with the construction year 2014 to address a problem with the manually constructable seat, so a communication of the US-American regulatory authority on Friday.
In some of the cars, it can give a defect in the mechanism for the rebuilding of the pre-award loans.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal Directives for vehicle safety for heads.
“When the vehicle comes down, it is possible that the head supports do not protect correctly, so there is an increased risk of injury,” was the news on the National Highway Traffic Security Administration (NHTSA).
The returned models were produced between August 1 and 10 September.
The delivery of GM-Trucks began in June and constitutes the main model start of the leading US-American car manufacturer since the unsolved restructuring 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA could not check the notification record because of the 16-day government Shutdowns, which was negative to the car sales in October.
The sale of silverado and Sierra Trucks, which were renewed for the model year 2014, had increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year.
In October GM 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra Peckup tricks.
The GM activity increased at the New York Burse at 37.47 US dollars on Friday.
A Obama selectioner
I have chosen President Obama two times in hope that changes are possible.
He said that Obama has undertaken loving efforts to be linked by the blockadetics of the Republicans.
The blockade policy does not apologize the website problems of Obamacare, the drug attacks
Obamas Memeings about the 2008 election campaign were a tragic memories of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at the Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I now read a terrible book.
It is a book I believed it would take me up during the second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (Own to win) and the Memeric Barack Obamas on the 2008 presidential election.
If I'm finished with my patients's records and I'm going to bed, then the book brings me back in a time when the policy inspired millions of people and a speaker could smile the breath.
The election was taken into an earthquake and a news speaker in order to lead to the historical importance of this hour.
My classrooms smile for joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready to change.
When Obama was then changed into the office in 2008, he had approval values of 82 %.
And then I closed the book.
Retrace to the present is a bad wake as if you're going down from a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a slow memory, a tragic memory of swimming opportunities.
In the years since I have left my first voice, something really changed.
But it's just nothing I could imagine.
I recognize the great and diversity of things that Obama has reached, from the adoption of the Afordable Care Act for hospital insurance until the military department from Iraq, the end of the distortion of homosexuality in the army and the murder of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the partial political blockadetics have joined many challenges with which our nation should be forwarded: immigration reform, public option for hospital insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to call only some of them.
However, after I have defended the Obama government against colleagues and residents, I am at the end of my statement request.
I have reached a point of political disaster.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why the voters of foreign heads of State are allowed or the murder of innocent children by drugs in the overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency samples data on the private life of Americans and why the Whistleblower is punished to open public failure behavior.
It cannot explain why Anwar Al-Australia, a US-American citizen, was murdered without procedures, and the public finance and expenditure limits will not be interfered during the presidency election.
It does not justify the results of a report, which means that the efforts of the White House to peace the media are “the most aggressive... since the Nixon government.”
And recently it can't apologize the incapacity to develop a simple website in those more than three years since the appointment of the Abordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I had to expect.
If I should understand with 18 that government work could oppose its advanced political campaigns.
Of course, the Deputy is not a predictable course, since a party of opposition and accidental events such as the Newtown Massaker is the public debate.
But if I look at the above examples, it seems to be widely chosen by the government itself.
And it's most of me.
I have chosen Obama again in 2012, not because I was deceived about his candidate.
Among Romney was a convincing and unreasonable alternative that he seemed to be able to fix his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second official period for Obama, free of the pressure of future elections, would meet the hope we had heard so long.
However, with the sense of approval values for Obama this week, the return of the book has become so deteriorated by 2008.
It strikes in me after the many promises that have resolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama had to lose a serious loss against Clinton at the predictions in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election assistants after the decision he told his workers that they should return to course and follow the purpose of their matter.
“ I want to find our magicians again, ” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr President, and I can't agree to you more.
The views expressed in this comment are only Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has interest conflict at parents' holidays
Milliardary and deputy, Clive Palmer, says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in an interesting conflict with his plans for parent holidays because his daughters are pregnant and therefore could benefit from it.
The mountainbuilding sharp, which is in a legal compensation on payment of $6 million in CO2 steel, pointed out the attention to the question of the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether CO2 and mountain construction taxes are cut or slow.
However, Palmer pointed out that only ministerial conflicts could have and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
“He is in a great interest conflict when it is for paid parent holidays, because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he has a direct interest in obtaining a vacation or not,” said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the selection committee Palmer declared 53 votes after the redistribution officially for the winner of the Sunshine Coast Side of Fairfax.
Palmer requested a revision of the scheme for the stimling accounting to make it possible to make it possible.
Tony Abbott daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these choices be decided two months after the end of the schedule?
“We need a better system” he said.
Why should we not have a system where you mark the data into a computer, immediately selected and then ended at 6:30?
Palmer also criticized the use of lyrics when marking the stims.
Do you use them because you can raise the results if they don't fall?
It is unbelievable to vote today with bleaflets.
The election committee has examined the options for electronic election and recently published a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59 declared that his policy heard an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take its new office “so serious”.
In the public office, it is about the public service.
“We are trying to pursue no reward except the story, namely that we can serve in a critical period of this Community”.
RBS suspends two duties
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two handlers from its department, so two persons who are trusted in the situation, and this is another indication that the world's responsive investigation of the mutilational manipulations on the monetary market is slightly driving.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, German Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the most important financial market, on which 5.3 billion US Dollars are changing the owners every day.
The two handlers would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the extensive investigation, which the scandal goes around the Libor interbank business.
The bank, who did not comment on the suspension, confirmed this month that they received information requests from authorities.
“We continue to investigate this topic and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities” said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month the situation has been closely reported that RBS has continued the registration of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a previous handler to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This Manufacturer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and was to be authorized by his current position as the European Chief of Forex Spot Haandel at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Chief of the European Spot Trading in Citi, was allowed this week, and Matt Gardiner, formerly leading currencies at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
No of these handlers was predicted for any defect behavior.
On the Instant Message Group of Usher, bankers in Barclays and the Citi-Gruppe said the situation was close.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority declared that she was investigating a swiss manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six world authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competitive Authority Weko, the FCA, the US-American Ministry of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently employed with precursors that bankers have had to deal with transactions in the monetary market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also introduced internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said with confidence in the situation.
Instant Messages and E-mails from several years in search for cases of misconduct.
The reports on these investigations have been reported by the handlers in a sector in the past years, which has heard to one of the most profitable ones of the investment banks, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to switch the shops and said that it is nearly impossible to handle the extensive and high-graduate liquid switch market, but leading handlers believe that this is not indefinitely true.
One leader noted that, despite the huge daily volume in the market, the liquidity fraction between the various trading platforms and the increased use of their own internal platforms by banks leads to “the market with very low ticket prices”.
The news came on the same day as credit Suisse announced, this week she announced a handyer of her London Exchange Traded Funds office, after he ended the last year a loss of only six million dollars.
The bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them.
“We are sure that the handler has been treated alone and that the matter has been dealt with,” said credit Suisse.
The Building Sea on the Beothle Graduate
A group of "Swiss Wiese" citizens' initiative has enhanced the construction crowd at the beachle-based house at the curpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it was cut and spread the footway, which is called in a press communication.
The planned departure of the disappearing house in the back of the basement was not permitted by security reasons, as it threatens to abstain.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the basement, had spoken with his colleague Reinhard Domke by the BI.
Before the BI's action, a transparency was taken with the message "We have done so."
However, about 20 members of the citizenship initiative were unlikely in their action.
Their moot on the large place called "We are against bauruins."
In this way, she wanted to indicate the risk of even more ruins on the Swiss Wiese - the rican project should be painted on a day.
In conversation with many passengers before the "building" it was clear that some citizens believe that it will be much better with the implementation of the city project, although few of them have the same questions to the size of the project as the BI.
But they began to resign because the city continues to delay these answers, it is from the side of the BI.
As it was to hear, the public statements of the Citizens were also affected.
In May the Council's meeting said that he feared the outcome for the thermal bath, the population should vote on the plans for a bath and wellness complex on the Swiss fishermen.
Some seem to be very shocked because others are as "plump pressing tries" at the population, which means that it continues in the press communication of the BI.
The BI thanked the costs for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick shields for swimming: Manual no swimming king
So satisfied Ralf Rangnick, with the current high-form of Federal Liga, Red Bull Salzburg, has also shown the sport director of the "Bolen".
"There is a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are put into the category of Shuttle Beans", he took the two open workers in protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
Younger Stocks for Rangnicks Critic was a gleb for Mane at 3:0 against Gross on Sunday last, where the Senegale was a suitable shooting player - which freely was not how TV images shown.
"A grise lack of decision," Rangnick said, "the Scheedsdirector Harkam is "humanly overcome".
Harkam would also participate in the sculption between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
His German Landsmann defended: "I would be in every situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleagues after the sharp kitchen.
I don't know why.
"When I am those who were politicianed," the 46-year-old boys stressed.
In view of the success cycle, Rangnick realized a lobeshym.
"For that there are only two words: Very good," he noted.
There is no lot to use.
Especially the way the mansion plays is impressioning.
This must be quiet.
Framework changes in winter transit time will not be given.
There are no wonderful reasons to change something.

Supreme Court confirmed Obamas Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama Government: the US High American Court has decided today that the closely linked health law with Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges condemned that the individual mandate of the patient's protection and Abordable Care Act – it requires US-American citizens to complete a hospital insurance until 2014 or to pay a punishment – is constitutional in the framework of the tax authority of the State.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts was on the side of the four liberal members of the room, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the legislation, and also concluded that the provisions of the health law, whereas the Federal States should extend access requirements for medicine or, at least, all state medical supports should not be restricted in constitution.
The complaint procedure against the law was undertaken by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decisively rejected by all leaders of the Republic of Presidency, including the last challenger, Mitt Romney in 2012.
Norway: Norwegian place with rich levels makes light
With huge spiegels, the inhabitants of a norwegian spectacular light have brought into their dark talent.
Because of the lowest sun invasion level, the Rjukane in the Fifty-Tal is normally in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors in 45 meters height, a century traum was real at midnight.
"End!", warm Citizen Meister Steinar Bergsland at the starting season in the TV2 sending.
Some tall residencies were right to shoot sunsets, others placed safely half sunlights.
Solar hungers had to walk in winter with a seal train on a nearby hill.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to spend the rails with spiegels into the Tal.
But this foundation has already been in place since 1913.
After a number of years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million chronics (circled 615 000 euros).
A similar construction has been made to the Italian Alpenort of Viganella winter sunlight for a few years.
Post not yet learns Sundays
"The many citizens will have not yet noticed that the red points for Sunday League are still at various letter boxes of the nuclear cities and the cities, but they read the small printed to the yellow post AG conservators, soon find that the leisure to sun and holidays does not happen", the FDP shares.
A request of the FDP confirmed it.
On Sun and Festivals only before the post building in the Ernst-Ludwig Street 36 and in the Jacob-Muller Strategy 1 is read in garden field.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosen garden is also read even Sunday, it is not answered in the answer to the request of the FDP.
The FDP's social and juvenile speaker, Fritz Rourenbeck, wants to follow here.
The Sunday Learning is an important post service just at Termin Post.
"They consider this sub-acceptation, despite the increase in prices for letters on January 2013, radially and inadmissible."
Thomas Bittner, Group and City Chairman of the Liberals, supports his group colleagues: "What is hungry, the fact is that this is the fact that the leisure periods are sweetly changed or even stripped."
From citizens, the post is far away from there.
"It is at least necessary to read the letter shops in the cities new and Rosen gardens again Sunday," says Bittner and Rohrenbeck unisono.
Also for the nuclear city, especially not mobile citizens, a letter box should also be able to reach the Sunday Learning.
Rourenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city management plans to discuss the post on this matter.
Master Erich Mayer answered that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But his knowledge also gives it a Sunday learning in Hofheim.
Your party has already spoken for privacy.
"There will be taken decisions to another place", said Mayer.
Frankfurter park costs should increase strongly
Parks in Frankfurt could soon be shooting.
The Majesty of the city is held today on a presentation of transport developer Stefan Majere (Green).
The parking costs should be increased by 50%.
However, the prices are not increased, but the time interval of parking and parking cars are reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.

The German Transport Club is the view that an increase after two decades is "adequate and indeed overcome."
The public transport will also be loaded.

They need these free connections to conservate.
Tribukit said she would not disappear it in this place to break a lance for the planned bioosphere area.
In this planning, the current measure is not only unlikely.
A biosphere area also provides the possibility of a sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the international recognised unico status and, therefore, continued complement of the life project as well as the previous tasks to be achieved for the future.
Following these various exhibitions, Reverendor Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the helpers in groups.
The largest trees were already shocked in the preview, the forest wheelder, where appropriate.
A group of helpers should care for the release of Wacholderbs and for the ships of a stone roof.
The goal was the free view on the point of view.

Google, Samsung, Huawei for Northern Patents
The group, which had thousands of previous Northern Patents, tried on Thursday a slaughter of cards because of patent injury against phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was overlooked by Nortel at the insolvency deployment.
Rockstar, who purchased the Northern Patent for 4,5 billion US-Dollar, declared Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies because of patent injuries before the United States district in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the Community possession of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is regarded in seven cases of patent injury.
The patent's technology that brings the search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising in accordance with the relevant advertising, thus the composition that affects the kernel of Google's search machines.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rock star were not immediately available.
Samsing, Huawei and HTC makes phones that work with the Google's operational system Android, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google decreed a initial order of more than 900 million dollars for the Northern Patent.
Google increased his offer several times and bot last 4.4 billion dollars.
After it was offered to the Northern Rockstar's patents, Google Motorola Mobility for 12.5 billion US Dollar, a business that was also motivated by the motorolas library of patents.
“What Google has been done with his attempt to purchase the applicant at the auction, Google has hurted the patent and continues to do this,” says the complaint.
Rockstar calls for a high deal of Google, as it claims, that Google's patent injury is absent, so the accused.
Egyptian first-selected Presidents
Mohammed Mursi declines the office, but his day of the Triumph should not mean the end of the political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egyptians” as he was appointed as the first-selected President of the country, and so the follow-up of Husni Mubarak, who had been released 16 months ago from the office.
With its office before the Supreme Constitution Court, Mursi was also the first freely elected Islamic presidents of the Arab world and Egyptian fiveth Head of State since the slaughter of Monarchie for about 60 years ago.
He put the ice before the 18th in black robes the judges of the court who had his seat on the Nil and followed a ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are trying to make a better future, a new Egyptian and a second Republic,” said Mursi at the celebratory ceremony, which was transferred to the public television.
“Actually, the Egyptian people has set the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability – said the 60-year-old muri, an engineer and a member of the Muslim fraternity, a fundamentalist group who has been mostly taken into view since its creation 84 years ago as a banned organization of the government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers waited for the building, as a Murisi short after 11 a.m. in a small autoconvoi.
Only a few hundred adherents had gathered before the court to join the new presidents, and in contrast to the presidential Prunk from the Mubarak Seat, the transport was held only short-term so that the autoconvoi could overcome the normally skilled road that the city centre was connected to the southern cities.
As an uncharismatical "epassrad" of the brotherhood, his personal presidency has adopted since his victory and a freeday speech, where he was not only a candidate of Islamics, but all of those who wanted to put a goal against the author Mubarak in 2011.
“Egyptes are today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state” the slaughter dressed in a blue slaughter with red claws the judges in the cottoned room where he put the office.
Later, Mursi went to the university of Cairo, where he was supposed to keep his arrival talk.
He was officially welcomed by a army capsul, who played the national symptoms that he heard in Habsat.
The Chief Field Marshall Hussein Tantawi was present.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendants in the largest hearing hall of the university with speakings of “The army and the people are a hand”.
In 1908, Kairo's university established as a secondary educational basis has developed a high-scale of Islamic students in the 1970s.
On Friday a symbolic eye on the Tahir plate, the birth place of the resurrection, which led last year to the end of the authory government Mubaraks, and he required to requiring prestigious powers that the Military Board had received from the Head of State inherited from the Office.
However, with the delay of the official ice before the court, and not as normally before the Parliament, he is in the will of the military, which indicates that the fight of power will continue.
Murisi's speaking on the Tahir plate was full of dramatic bees.

Manager in South Africa: twice living prison
Nine months after the brutal assault and abuse of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the murderer was sentenced to live twice on Friday.
This reported the SABC Sender.
The victim later died to the consequences of serious injuries.
Johannes Kana was already found for the beginning of the week of crime.
The fact was removed by the country's expansion.
At that time, Anene Booysen in February in a industrial camp in Bredasdorp near Capstadt.
14 hours the doctors struggled for the survival of the victim, however.
The view of young people was so decisive that the employees and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had indicated during the process that he was in a bar with Booysen at night.
He also tried to have them struck and forced, but he is engaged in being responsible for the death of the girl.
The police was first out of several murders, but two suspects decided to be sentenced because the evidence against them did not suffice.
The State Authority also stressed during the procedure that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is already in South Africa almost every day: there are some 64.000 shows because of sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people are clearly more than South Africa (50 million).
Police and Women's Associations in South Africa estimate the dark rates of sexual violence 10-25 times.
Jumbo visits the black tree skins
Jumbo on the search for the "Best Skin of the World": For the TV "Galileo" sending, the Pro7-Star Bonndorf visited the Pro7-Star Bonndorf.
The speaker is equally clear to the beginning: The most important for the skins are the skins, the turbomast is not a good condition.
Can skins that you get in any supermarket, so are you a quality product?
Uli as the chief of the big skin manufacture in the Blackwald Jumbo declares how the "adler" company works in Bonndorf.
"Germany skins", like Jumbo announces the black tree skins.
Only with hair hair and kittel he comes inside the manufacture.
Jumbo also has to detect the hands first before he can attack the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening in Snellimbis in Waldshut
"This is worked for me a lot of quantities," the television machers, black wood skins as mass products were surprised.
16.000 cubits per week speak for themselves.
Weight, Fetta part, Colour: Uli explains what it comes to quality.
Most skins are killed with six months.
TV with levels?
The details like the p-value of the flesh also play a role.
You shine the flesh, higher than the ph value.
"I'm shocking if you like Roberto Blanco what happened then," says Jumbo Zynisch.
Here the level of the privacy view is presented in reinculture.
But the spectrum is rejoicable.
The viewer seems that the slaughter of the cules is still handling.
Because: Black wood skins are traditionally without finding skins in the regal.
The secret of the skin is the mixture with the salz.
Jumbo optically remembers fuming and fuming on a "U-Boot".
The trick: Tanners are safe here in smoking for the special grain of the black wood skin.
20 days in smoking the skins finally make almost black.
"The last time the slaughter misses in the jumbo," he announces the test speed.
"He's really sweet," the facility of the TV star.
This will be possible to live all of the parties.
Do you think travel offices belong to the Internet of the past?
Flight Center seems to be opposed to the trend.
The company has increased its profit views for the total year and expected record revenues of vacants in Australia and Britain.
The travel company is now expenditure of a yearly winning prior to taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous prognosis.
If the current target values are achieved, it means a growth of 12 to 17% compared to the recursion wine of $290.4 million in the period 2011/12.
As operating director Graham Turner announced, flight center reached eight percent of wins in the first half year and stored a strong start in the second half year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
“In the beginning of the year, our ten countries are profitable, and some of them are on good way in the direction of the recording year revenues before interests and taxes,” he explained.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically belong to our most stronger results.
In Australia, the free-time sector was obtained in the second half of the year, which is an easyly weak market for business travels.
Similarly, it has been good for the free-time business of Flight Centre in Britain, while the business workers are also less expenditure.
The U.S. business was recovered against the lowest first half-year, so that for the third year, it would be expected to win for the total year.
The shops of Flight Centre last night stood at $3,20 at $38.20.
Schools are maintained to be more focused on mathematics, literature and gramms
In the course of English literature, students must be treated at least one part of Shakespeare, a Roman of the 19th century, romantic Lyrics and temporary British Romans since 1914.
The test also finds the entry of “unexpected texts” in order to spend a wide range of readings.
The combined course from English literature and language is discarded.
Since 2015, students need to depend on a own GCSE language review, with strong encouragement to select English literature as separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will be published tomorrow the new education plans for English and Mathematics – the first cases that have been radically revised.
Other nuclear cases will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Supervisory Authority, a new organization of GCSE structures, including a new system of use and less currency work.
In one summer, Minister of Education, Michael Gove said that there is a “width consensus that we need to reform our testing system to restore public trust”, and he stressed that GCSES would be“decisive, ambitionated and stretched”.
Studies show that less time for mathematics is used in English schools – 116 hours per year or three hours per year — than in most other countries.
In the meantime, Australian schools receive average of 143 hours annually and students in Singapore 138 hours.
There is no formal request to predict more time for mathematics in the hour plan, but it means that the comprehensive mathematic testing – combined with a greater weight of the special in the rings – will probably encourage schools to use more hours.
In the school plan, more attention will be made on “problems from the right life”, including financial mathematics.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenic discussion forum
At the next Ecumenic conversation forum on Monday, 21 October, the new museum of the slopes is about the topic "Theological discussions on the current discussion with the last things".
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenic Talk Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church Communities Salem, the Sloth Salem and the Cultural Land Series.
Johannesa Rahner wants to ask in the forum of the question, as today people take the "last things" after the death.
If people were too well known about it in the past centuries and put on those images of heaven and hell, "who gives our ideas to this day," then the modern prophetic teachings of hopes to be completed by a certain intelligence or speaklessness.
"The greater hope is part of Christians and Christians by the religious criticism", says the referendum.
She said, "We have assured so many questions signs that it seems to have come to us to have the callmarks."
Johannesa Rahner continues to say: "The crucial challenge remains the illness of death."
In this way, if the question is due to that sense, "this dreams that at the end everything may be good."
Johannesa Rahner, born in Baden-Baden, studied from 1982 to 1989 Catholic theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freeburg.
She promoted 1997 to Dr. Theol., also in Freeburg.
The capacity for fundamentalal theology and Ecumenic theology followed 2003 at the Western Wilhelm University.
Since 2010, Johannesa Rahner has a systematic theology institute at the Institute for Catholic Theology of the University of Castle.

Irmensee: Second Mountainbike residents
At the wonderful weather, 214 drivers arrived to the Irmensee to round the round course around the sea.
This shares Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sports convenin Irmensee.
Among the participants, particularly on the short distance of 15 km and 300 feet (300 meters) were also numerous routines who wanted to exercise their hobby once in a wet-food mosphere.
Two Dutch drivers of German Spitzen classs were also started at the start: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good places at the German masters.
These pains could be able to spend in expectation from the field.
As in the past year, Felix Bader could save a small time prediction to the target and defended his title as the total shift of the short distance.
On the two places, Pascal was able to resort to pass at once.
With the ladies, Theresa Duelli was from the swimming team, which made it upstairs upstairs.
On place two and three, Anne Adel came from the Irmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A joyful development is the growing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole band width was represented by sportors.
The age structure was also rich in the age of ten years up to over 70 years in the age of the age.
In the main course of this year, more absolute topaths were started.
Four drivers could be delayed from the regions of pitches.
In addition, Philipp Pangerl, a mountainbike Halbprofi from the Black Tusk Racing Team.
Pangerl was together with a team colleague twice world master in twelve hours.
In this year, he became Master of Europe in this special discipline.
This is also Roland Ballerstedt, who already called two German master titles in Duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters, there was a whimper-final in the goal in front of the three-see hall.
Pangerl was first over the target line.
Only one second ago the Rutinian Ballerstedt could ensure the second place in total value.

In the review, Christian Cohsmann was the most fastest time in the main course.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from binzwangs before Natascha Werners from Stuttgart.
Sporters and helpers were very satisfied with the unrealized and well-organized end of the event.
Trace through slaughter, rivers and dyskins for free medical supply
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical assistance in intelligence villages in Kamerun
Nearly every weekend to treat hundreds of patients
There are no many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people
Call here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the top 10 of the CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him to “CNN Hero of the Year”.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue its extraordinary work.
21 years ago, George's Bwelle saw how his sick father always lost the consciousness and traveled to hospital homes that did not have the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured at a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First, he had only a broken arm, but then it was a devastation that extended himself to his brain and caused a hematom that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neurochirurgs in Kamerun,” says Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Kamerun if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelles passed to join his father in overwhelming clinics and hospitals in order to get the treatment they were offering.
“It's not easy” comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00 tomorrow and go to the hospital to be the first, and it's not first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed since the father of Bwelles died in 2002.
There is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon, so the World Health Organization.
The relationship in the United States is at a doctor of 413 persons.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most of the cameruners could not be visited.
Two of five people in the country live under the poverty limits and nearly three of the health expenditure in the country are private.
“The only problem they have is the poverty,” Bwelle says.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
In Bwelle, his father and so many of his lands suffered the decision to do something.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his voluntary team have performed free operations in the last 700 years.
He himself was a doctor and worked as a prison surgery in the Central Hospital in Yaundé.
He also established a common organization named ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas and offers free medical supply there.
Since 2008, he and his voluntary group have helped just 32.000 people.
Nearly every Friday he went to 30 people in a small bus and walked with the shooting medical equipment on the toilet over unfinished terrain in the villages that need the help.
It's not always slow.
More than once they had to shoot the vehicles through rivers and slamps.
But when they come, they will be received as heroes: a festival, sweet and dance, and the best income that the place has to offer.
In these villages, it is really a reason for the holiday and the bwelle – with its wide laughing and its unlimited energy – to be pleased at the joyful feast.
On the next morning, the team starts with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 persons for driving” Bwelle says.
They come from a round of 60 kilometers around the village – and it is on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated because of Malaria, Tuberculosis, Food, Diabetes, Parasites and sexually transmissible diseases.
Others receive bridges, independent brills or free birthdays – a document that is necessary for the school, but many poor families are not simply able to provide.
Tonight the team performs simple operations with local smoking.
The operations are normally in a school, the council or a apartment; after the invasion, patients are up and go to the recovery area to make places for the next ones.
The advertising for the OP and the desinfection refund is shocked by the group generator and thus works Bwelle and volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is an encouraging pension, but the village musicians normally help to keep the team motivated.
“They smile all night, so that we can stay up and continue our work,” Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, sweet, but is proud of the work done.
The group – a mixed of camera-unity doctors and foreign medical students – has performed free operations in the past 700 years and knows that it affects a huge difference for people helping it.
One man explained that the free operation of a leisure brown that he has received allows him to work again.
“This changes the future of my family,” said the man.
Besides weekend clinics and its work as a surgery in the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his common activity, so Bwelle; the rest is out of private costs.
“I really don't know when he sleeps,” says Katie O'Malley, who studys the Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicina, and works voluntaryly in the Bwelles Group in the second year.
He's always in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and hospital students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelles, this is an opportunity to collect practical experiences that they would never get home.
“We can be in operations where we help to cut blood or keep Dr. Bwelle instruments,” says O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students pay their travel to Kamerun normally and often brings dependent health materials.
But if they are just once in Yaoundé, Bwelle overcomes the undercoming, transportation and guidance.
“He is a hero without doubt,” says O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Camunian people know no borders.
For Bwelle the nearly permanent work is no charge.
Others to help a more happy life and to fulfill a promise that he gave his Father provides to him great joy.
“I am so happy if I do this job,” says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to bring people back to laugh and to lie the pain.

He creates to focus on the attention of the public, so that his monologists aren't a moment slow.
His efforts to endure the fish on the surface of the water are so true that the observers forget that the sea only exists from blue water flashes.
Governor Jens Hasselmann allows the old man to act in the boat before the fisher village.
In the course of the opening, he puts the active scenes into the light: the garden of Santiago, the bar of the songs Marie-Luise Gunst, who meets Kuba's life feeling with their songs and their magnificent voice.
The four musicians play in Kubas Rhythmus and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Abstract to Romans
At about 120 meters of length, a dishwasher canal is obtained from the Roman time.
Whoever visits the kitchen will not end in the dom.
The two doors in the sky were around 157 meters and make it to the second church building of Europe.
However, only a few visitors who shock the two filigrans, admit that there is also a lot of discovering under the dom.
Rainer Schools are experts in the field of Kölner underground.
The service centre of Köln-Tourism is directly on the dom.
The round ring begins very unspectacular, "We're going to be in the deep garage," says school.
In the seventy-year-old years, the city desired a self-government city, and therefore the rest of the old towns were just as far as it was not too large.
As a result, most users of the parking house eat today also over to the Roman rest and just give up their car.
But who looks more accurate, finds in the Parkdeck D2 an archaeological foundation separated by metal gitter.
It's about five meters higher rocks from large stones.
"There are the remains of the Roman city Maurice, built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says school.
Before it comes back to the daylight, schools allow the participants to look at the top of the park in a window, 15 meters deep shadow.
This is the burns of the old domain, which, unfortunately, will be uncomfortable.
The next round station is the premium, and here the participants will return to the depth.
Here we experience the office of the first powerful man north of the Alpen, the Chairman of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, you want to know a visitor.
"The decline is for "Collonia Claudia Ara Agripinessium", which means at a well-known German, as "Romic Law and City of the Agriprins, founded by Caiser Claudius on the place of the Altar for the Caisercult".
And in the preatur, it is the former statue, the power center of the Roman Empire in the Rhine.
From the premature of the exhibition, a tunnel access to the Roman water channel is obtained here about 120 meters long.
"You can get a bit quiet away from the so-called cloaca Maxima, if you want to do", supports the guests.
A surprising has a school.
After he helped the key at the castle, he leads the group to a 16-metre deep shadow.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bathroom," he says.
The Jewish congregation built its baths deeply in the ground to come to the ground water that was unconditionable for the rituals.
To this day, at the late end of the mikwe, whose origin is back to the eighth century, different water plants can be able to be changed by switch skin of the rain.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the Council House for which the construction works are to start in rounds.
But there will be a few years until the completion.
It's almost discarded: Resetting Rocker process
A blue attack in the Rockermilloe is re-rolled over four years.
A process for attempting death, dangerous injury and damage against two 30-year-olds has started before the landscape of Frankfurt (or).
It is accompanied by strict security arrangements.
The detainees smile up.
They should have been active in the rocker line and then have heard the bandidas.
In June 2009, the State Authority proposes to attack and attack three men in a car together with unknown complexs in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All the victims were hardly injured, a man had almost lost his skin.
The victims should have heard of the competitive grouping Hells Angels.
One would have been a high-range member of Berlin.
It seemed to be a persecution year with several cars.
According to the accused, it was about reverse battles and a power-demonstration.
The two complaints were released in a first procedure in the beginning of 2012.
A court speaker said that it has not been able to prove that men have actually been involved in the blue error.
The murders had loaded masks and were not recognized.
The Court of Justice took the sentence after review of the State Authority and returned to the Countrygericht to the renewed negotiations.
One of the complaints is now because of another crime in the open fulfilment.
At the moment, it was particularly about the reconstruction of the ears in the night.
As a witness, the Commissioner who then identified was loaded.
In the centre, telephone talks were held by the defenders and other persons who heard the police.
It is difficult that Rocker almost always holds a law for them - and does not appeal to them.
This applies also to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims was packed.
State advocate Stefan Golfier from the State Authority Frankfurt (or) said that it had been new specimens since the last procedure.
11 further negotiations are implemented for the process.
The road business company does not think
The night was long, the music sounds and the smiling is good, but at once it goes home.
Only: In the shipping of people on the car and residue, the hunger is noticed.
Clearly, that may be responsible for one or another cocktail or sect!
What is closer to driving to next Drive in order to mount a littleness?
I'm sorry, I'm glad to be with it when it's about the late night in the early morning on the fat food hole.
A few pommes, a Cola, a Burger - and then nix like home and bed!
However, on the homeway, the clear differences between me and other hungry Disco groupers are marked.
Because what is lacking that you're driving your fat food products out of the car window constantly?!!
Especially at the weekends, deleted papers on road countries and parking places.
"What?" I ask.
Are the people too buffy to take the murders with respectful home to the next murderer?
It's not just that the paper product changing the landscape.
Mordes have already discovered transport systems such as guideline plans and resolved accidents.
In this way, "Wow Competitive Society" did not follow, she probably don't even know what this word really means.
If you are on the end of the road, just right with several people in the car, you can know how a back bank can look after the nights: clamps, flashes and other moulds.
There would be more or less mortality than nix - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to smile on the rest of others.
I have seen the day when the cities and communities will be cut off, and the fat food chains are required for their deaths.
Obamas retreats in health policy
After a huge criticism, President Obama made a back in his frequencies, clear promise: “If you like your hospital insurance, then you can keep them.”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of proclamation, the Republicns made the President in the last few days that he has declared the American public.
Last relative Obama is original promise.
“The overwhelming majority of the citizens who have a functioning hospital insurance can keep them,” he said at a talk in Boston.
As a reaction to the numerous media reports on the advertisements, Obama requested those Americans who received such communications to keep up on the free market after a new insurance.
Most citizens could receive better, comprehensive hospital insurance for the same price or better than prognostic.
“He's coming to a better offer” he said.
It was a little surprising that the five percent of the people who had completed an insurance should take place after another tariff, since their treaty did not discuss the new standards under the Abordable Care Act.
“I would like to say these Americans directly, that you have won best,” said Sebelius at a hearing before the Committee on Energy and Trade of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for the implementation of the Abordable Care Acts, declared that the start of the online platform had been lost since October “miserable”.
“I am also frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I'm decided to get your trust back.
On the basis of the strict consultation in the Representative House, this proclamation of a seven-year-old Sebelius was taken from Missouri, which was obliged to participate in Obamacare, after a struggle with the Republican deputy Billy Long from Missouri.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeated why the ‘architectin’ of the Abordable Care Acts did not volunteerly denied on a stately promoting insurance to complete a tariff at HealthCare.gov that they now want to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem confirmed that the attack against Syrian aircraft is not
A American government official, who wanted to remain anonym, pointed out on Thursday, against the American newspaper CNN, that Israeli fighters had attacked an air base in the Syrian Latvia a day ago.
The objective was "Rakes and Party equipment" which feared the Israeli government that they were intended for the Libanese Hibola, said CNN.
Syrian and Libanese media and the Arab Sender Al-Arabia had previously reported that the support point in the port city of Latakia was struck on Thursday night, and Israel was responsible for this.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the shuttle point in Latakia, where Russian switch radars were to see from the type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 rakets, the channel 2 has a swimming range of 35 kilometers and can be transported up to 70 kilometers.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the News Agency Reuters also cites an anonymous Israeli government official with the words, he believes that Israel has executed the attack, but it is not sure.
A speaker of the Israeli defence Ministry said every case, "We do not comment these reports."
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai pointed out in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime was already successfully tried to deliver land-luft rats to the hibola.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that every trial of Syrians to give the hibola with chemical or other dangerous weapons was able to overcome a "red line" which would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unfair event that the United States spontaneousship was “too far away”.
John Kerry said, with an unexpected ingest, that the situation of the United States was decreasing in respect of their monitoring programs, saying that the spionage was being “widden in certain cases”.
The Foreign Minister also acknowledged him with Barack Obama to the responsibility that they were shooted on "autopilot" when the explosive enthusiasms of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden's Whistle Snowden were publicly publicly.
The U.S. government has been covered in a diplomatic strike of the detection of its associations.
In a video-related speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “I have learned to the President and I and others in the government of some things that are almost cut by autopilot, just because the ability was to have the second world war and the difficult years of the war, and of course on 11 September.”
Then he was the first member of the US-American Government that the US-Spionage had overlooked a border, but also stressed that no rights were misused.
He said, “In some cases it has been too far.”
The President has decided to make clearness, and therefore carries a green investigation so that no one needs to have the feeling to find an error here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process are not affected.
However, Kerry found that the NSA was a power of good and that many lives were saved through its supervision operations.
He added: “We have to do it with a new world, in which people are ready to shoot themselves into the air”.
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is able to kill people, to shoot into the air and attack governments.
So what if you could start and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircrafts, buildings and people's murder because we have experienced such plans.
In the meantime, the US-American legislators will continue to travel to Europe in order to destroy the concerns against the American spionage and convince Europeans that they need to continue to cooperate with the anti-terrorism efforts, as the President of the Senate Committee for European Affairs stated on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats to take part in the supervision of the National Security Agency in anti-terrorism organizations.
“It is very important for the United States national security interests that Europeans remain in the context of our common efforts to combat terrorism on Borde,” said Murphy, who first as a democracy in the Senate and is the President of the Senate Subcommittee for External Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to clarify that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their infirms over the NSA programmes.
Media reports, which the NSA has discussed millions of telephone data in Europe, have reported the relationships with some United States associates, while the Chief of the Secret Service has explained this week, the reports were incomprehensible and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by Nato partners and were discussed with the United States.
Other enthusiasms quoted by Snowden, which the NSA has watched the phone of Federal Cancer Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of the world.
The Chief of National Secret Services, James Clapper, defended the spirit of associations as necessary and explained that this was generally on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy said that his authority would prepare the trip of the Congress that will take place this year, and hoped that the delegation will include members of both parties and rooms.
The names of the other Members participating should be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact reiserout will still be developed.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of traveling was the improvement of the relationship, he also said that there would be some “precedent words. ”
He said that the European Governments should be honestly against their population about the type of sponsoring programmes which they themselves have been implemented for years.
“What we can change our monitoring programmes and protect better the rights of the Europeans, they must also feel that we are not the only ones that spontaneize,” says Murphy.
During the weekend, John Kerry is on a trip to the Middle East and to Poland in order to go together with the Growle over the US Strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran and the US oversight activities.

Australia's professional infringement against prison penalty in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced in Phuket for 15 days in prison because she was fairly entitled to be inflicted by a taxi driver, has been sentenced against the sentence and was released on a cup.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first condemned by a province court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a false seat after she was given against the Thai police, a local taxi driver was forced on Sunday 10 June, while two other men were arrested.
Later, however, the accommodations of a video camera showed that she was safely reached in her hotel after she was separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket listened to Bamford two days until she thought about the story.
Before the Court's negotiation, she was held in police in place.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison penalty in a prison in a low security stage at Rande Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgiy Liga, who used to the Foreign Minister in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained about Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the whole family is “extreme concern” about the well-being of her daughter and wanted to have her back to Australia.
“We, of course, make us great concerns, but we hope they're home as soon as possible,” said Tunks.
Bamford has opposed the sentence and is against a cup of 50,000 Baht on a free feet.
In Australian reports it was to read that in the interim period she made vacation in the Krabi holiday place in Souththailand.
On the side of the court, Bamford will be held by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the profession could also lead to a higher punishment of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it can also be possible that Thailand may be trying to improve his proposed tourist image after the recent murder of the traveller Michelle Smith in Phuket, and therefore comes to an exemption.
