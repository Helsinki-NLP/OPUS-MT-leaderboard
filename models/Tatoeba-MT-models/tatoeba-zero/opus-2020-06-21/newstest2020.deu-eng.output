Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the Iranian port
More than two months after his establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the ports of the city Bandar Abbas on Friday. As a result of refinity's observance data, the tank moved and left the Iranian port. The target port was given by Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.
In fact, the tanker was already released by the Iranian government on Monday, but first he remained in Iranian waters. From the Riederi it was called to wait for an official decision from Teheran.

Musk needs recursing to achieve its high objectives. 2019 he wants to deliver totally 360000 to 400000 cars. This requires six-year-old numbers. Especially the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are less than the winning rates. Despite the boom losses.
Resolved cut: For this reason we can't kit yourself
A kind of brems in the big brain prevents people to kit themselves. This found researchers of the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of rats experiences how they shared on Thursday. In addition, progresses were achieved in the question, why children are so strongly fighting against the kitchen only to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why only the nearness of a kitchen hand has dissolved before the driving laugh. This lies on a deep shock in the big brain that already solved the laugh at the expectation of the kitchen.
According to the information, previous research showed that rats are reacting in the ultra-scale area when they are kitchened by people. This "Lake" is indicated by the part of the big brain whose central processing of haptical authorisation is given.
Laugh is under pressure during self-training
Before it has been outlined that the brain between self-training and conducting can be different from other people, so people can't be able to kiss themselves. The Berlin researchers now found the experts to the rats that the laughing, as well as the activity of the area of the big ceremonium during self-training, will be undermined. This is also the case if the lives themselves are put. During the care and the kitchen by the scientists were to laugh the activity in the hair and the impuls.
But pass the self-training and the conduct of others at the same time, it also understood the laugh. This indicated that the brain of therats could not be between self-training and treatment by other different kinds. The new knowledge closed that people could not kitchen themselves because self-training activates a brain in the big brain.
The rats were also trained to kiss themselves. In order to make this initiative in the experiment at times, they showed the behaviour or shock stars. This ambivalence is equal to the behaviour of children. The environmentality of the Kitzeln is a behavior reaction that is equal to rats and people.
Catastrophe used: Big Brand removed in French chemistry
The big burden in a chemistry as specially dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been removed. This shared the prefectures of the Normandia of the news agent AFP on Friday. The fire was broken on Thursday night.

Iran gives British tankers free
The United Nations general debate did not have a solution in the Iran conflict, but now there is a less problem, but the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" was able to be back in the sea, and it could be a puzzle in the Iranian president Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tank "Stena Impero" held since mid- July on the street of Hormus in Iran is returned to international waters. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the Rideri Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas and now the crew runs for medical investigations to Dubai, Reedereichef Erik Hånell. On the midday the ship left the Iranian waters. "That's finished," he said to the Swedish TV.
The Foreign Minister in London called the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a template of attempts to affect the freedom of the sea. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said in a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolution Gardens had established the tanker on 19 July under the provision to have been injured by the rule of the sea law in the Persian Golf. Seven of the 23 employees were already released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crowd members were in line with the situations, said Hånell. They would have been professionally referred to the difficult and enduring situations in the last ten weeks.
The British government smile behind the establishment of the "Stena Impero" a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: where the beginning of July was a supertank with oil from Iran, which was intended for Syria to be put to the chain. The delivery was sent to the authorities against the EU sanctions against the Syrian War. The reference to the ship was received from the United States.
In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released by the Iranian of "Piraterie" and was threatened by the consequences.
The street of Hormus is one of the most important seaways in the world. It is connected to the Persian Golf with the Indian Ocean. A majority of the world's oil exports is disappeared through the sea. In the past months, the swimming vessels were slowly cut into the conflict between the United States and Iran.
Among the shocks between Teheran and Washington, the Atom Stretch of both countries. Americans will want to build nuclear weapons, and the Iranians returned to it. The United States were in 2018, in the allegation of the International Atom Agreement which prevented the Iran in the construction of a atomic bomb, and had to end their political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government sets the leadership in Teheran with massive economic organizations against the country to strike up a strict and other areas. The Irani is opposed to the pressure.
In view of the fight on the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Golf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States works for a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a UN Voluntary Meeting plan for security and peace in the street of Hormus, which would like to ensure that the Persian Golf coalition would be able to be able to ensure the Iranian Golfs together with the Arab Golf States and without foreign protection forces for the security of the shipping vessels in the Persian Golf.
Independence is a better future with its Protectionist Economic Policy.
In view of the criminal rights associated with the American President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic, it is obliged to redistribute. Financial chiefs of Asian trade warfare who intended to grant their production from China in another country, call India in an investigation of the UBS as one of the preferentious alternatives. This is not only to do with the uncertainty of the Chinese-American trade wars.
But now India has been divided in Trumps focus. From the ski house of swimmingly referred to as "the Kingdom of the swimming", the United States took the trade benefits for 2000 products. The United States views high-scale rights and demands better market access for farmers, mobile phones, smilitures, motor leaders and other.
On the world map of trade wars, the Riberians with India are freely a side view. The world's largest democracy is also viewed by the security policy. Delhi and Washington bind the concern about China's powers in the Southern Ocean. On this background, American Criminal Tariffs against India are inconsistent. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has taken place for a second five-year period of office, should therefore be safe.
The problem is, however, in another place: The imperially encouraging those that open markets accelerated the economic development in the Socialist Republic of India has a serious position in the socialist Republic of India. The reformers aimed mainly on the bureaucratic Irish, which has so long renewed all enterprises' spirit in the multinational state. Companies now receive rapid construction permits for buildings. They benefit from an improved energy and transport infrastructure, and the conditions of the insolvency and concursion law to ensure that they are able to liquidate companies with high schools.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rakings, and in India's first five-modern years, there has been a lot of improvement, but it does not apply to trade policy, but to protect small international competitive companies against foreign providers, the national conservation government has even created new pains.
In the West, the model of the Nimbus of the energy reformers renewed its country economically radially. But this impression is not debt to the state that the Carismmatic Prime Minister is only to know what vocabulary of the Western Managers like. In the Kern, the "India Prime" advocate never depended from a Protectionist Economic Policy, which prevents that Indian companys were able to spend to spend an accromistical exhibition, and so that the global competition would be satisfied.
Adoption of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French president Jacques Chirac will be introduced in Paris in the next week.

The location will be held in a closely family circle. To Sunday, a public slaughter in Paris Invalidandom, as well as the media reports.
The competitors are aimed at: Dabo is the first home herd of the leastathletic-WM
The world's skin was a long time to shoot in the refined Khalifa International Stadium. In the first time of the men, over 5000 meters from Aruba, Jonathan Busby was able to shoot him with the danger. He could not be able to keep on the goal at 300 meters before the goal, walked in an unfortunate position, as Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau switched to him and supported the last half stadium rounds in the goal. The forces were in both, yet to stop the goal of the weapons. As the snipers were not enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same", said Dabo after the rain in Mixed area, when he had completely unexpectedly expected the attention of the collected journalists to himself. The shooting would never want to speak about his heritage. Finally he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a suffering partner. And without all he would be proud of representing his country that was invited by the World Group. In normal circumstances he couldn't be able to start. "It was I've been able to come here to my country," he said he said.
He did that at the evening with a lot more intensive than he was thinking about it. Because this herdent will be remembered. At the time of Dabo his competitors busby left the meeting in the goal and took the last place volunteerly - the other five minutes after the Ethioopian Selemon Barega, who wins this course. On the end, it was nothing to do, because only with much helped busby was disqualified by the end of the world’s light-based association.
It was Dabo who lived in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon to set up a personal best time at the WM in Doha, which was often official data with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was deceived: "I wanted to walk 17.55 minutes. I was just a minute at 18 minutes."
Million machines: Egyptians are for wild Protest Day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the preceding of possible governance critical protests. In the centre of Kairo, a strengthened police presentation was observed on Friday. several U-Bahn stations remained closed to the central Tahrir plate.
In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls, and the phones of footgrounds were in part searching on news and photos related to the protests, and hundreds of people were arrested by two non-governmental organizations.
Opposite of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, it was in Kairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. They protested against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critical corruption and misconduct. An open protest against the political leadership has not been given it for years in Egypt. The Egyptian manufacturers and shockers of Mohammed Ali, who had the demonstrations with video commands on Facebook, had not been given for the today freeday to a "millionary mars" central places in the Spanish exil. Alit for a "revolution of V".
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) continued to take more than 1.570 prisons. The Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organization (HRW) organization of Human Rights Watch (HRW) said of more than 2.000 prisons. Independently, these figures were not first confirmed. The government confirmed and not commented the numbers.
Volunteers
Many people were "weirly arrested" only because they were "fake to time in the wrong place" shared with HRW in vocational lawyers. The laws against the arrests are worthy according to details of their applicants of "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terroristic association". In Kairo, Alexandria and other cities, they asked for security forces in the Uniform, but also in civil clothes, after HRW instructions.
HRW also criticized the centre in the North African country. The government blocks Kairo websites and online services to connect further protests against Sisi.
Online owners: Senders should be able to ship back
For online shoppingers, many lost packages are lost. About 20 million return countries so on the moon. But there is a alternative.
The Financial Ministry has shown online shops like Amazon and Zalando a way how they can sell returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be freed from the transfer tax to Sachspends, the Ministry explained a question of the Green Day Group which reported the newspapers of the Funke Media Group on Friday, but the handlers could apply the market value of the non-produced returns so low that they should not be paid or not.
Scientists at the Bamberg University had identified that the federal citizens return to their sixth package on the Internet. round 4% of the goods - about 20 million products - would then land in the mould. They would be funded by the company after the current legal situation, as the financial authorities evaluate the debts as a transfer to the tax.
The Green Fraction Chef Katrin viewing Eckardt requested the Financial Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify that companies could not evaluate commercial products in accordance with commercial products and expenditure to common organizations. The enterprises should not be punished for costs. This was not only for online, but also for other businesses from the model load to the construction market.
Banksy expense for auction: There was never a better time to sell this meal
The known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is to be improved first.
The Banksys work is understood by the "Reformation of the oldest parliamentary democracy of the world in the foundation made by animals and stages".
The work was first issued in the 2009 Museum of Bristol in Southern England, where Banksy lives. In this year the artist had re-exhibited the event, as well as the original Brexit date on March 29, which was called the previous "Fragestune" named "Devolved Parliament" (delegated Parliament).
The image could change the owner for a million amounts.
Lastly, the Prime Minister Boris Johnson had received a hard slaughter with the opposition at the first meeting of the home after the resignation of a Johnson's summer suspended by the Supreme Court. Johnson would also like to comply with the twice moved Brexit on October 31, as well as without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in South England, he called a man who is a man who is a man who destroys a star of the European fleet. The work is seeing thousands of Lkw fabrics and other visitors in the UK.
Brexit-debates are like a "spacing in the park"
The intense attacks of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit's guest in Parliament are not involved in a climate of hate. In comparison to the election campaign before the Brexit Referendum 2016, the current contraverse is a "spacegang in the park", Dominic Cummings said on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy this. We will come out (of the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had a hard attack in the parliament in the past days and predicted them, inter alia, "training" to the people, and accused that he could put the Members in danger because they could be a goal of murder threats, he did as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to make peace again is to be if the Members would finally respect the decision of the United Kingdom for a departure from the EU, and it is not surprised that people have been covered that Britain had not yet been out of the EU three years after the referencedum.
In view of the exciting smiling, even the Bishops of the English Church were to retain. "We should talk to each other with respect," he said in a statement. "and we should also hear."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan requests one entry in Kaschmir
With a emotional appeal, the President of Pakistan, Iran Khan, again requested the United Nations to re-interrupte the Cashmir Conflict.
On the other hand, if a renewed war between the Pakistan and India, most likely, Khan said on Friday at the Un-General debate in New York. "When this is bad, you hope the best, but prepare to the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Cashmir. "If you had to prevent this."
Independence from the British colonial rulership in 1947, India and Pakistan have led three wars to the shared region of Cashmir. Both nuclear forces have dominated a part of Cashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August, the Indian Cashmir regions had decreased the autonomy status of the Indian Cashmir and thus increased the shoes in the relative to Pakistan.
Not even a flash water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the slaughter of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
With the present protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand, and it can shoot the population with a heavy muscles, shooting over 2000 prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners that were already placed there. Protests were never in danger. However, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was enforced in 2013, the State apparatus makes everything to avoid a scenario as in Arab early times.
But one of the Protest 2011 solving was the bad economic situation. Poorness, perspectiveness and feeling to be switched by the own government, spend millions on the street. And this is a problem that also does not get the regime of el-Sisi into the face, even as it is hard towards the rebellion.
Today, every third in Egypt lives under the poverty limit. Since 2016 the currency has lost more than half its values, the inflation rate is ten percent. Those in the Supermarket want to buy a flash water must decide whom he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the Military. Lastly, it is not only responsible for the submission, but also the largest economic actor. The military buildings, houses, football stadiums, produced food and many more. This was already before it. With the authorities have a lot of experience, the dilemma is an alte market. It will always be critical if there is a large part of the population’s weaknesses.
Twiv tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No "showstopper" more for main city flights
Two months has been examined whether the complex installation in the BER frame works together. The operators are satisfied with the loop, but the TV is not yet finished at BER.
After large Twiv tests at the end of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the opening planned in October the following year. This is sure, the Supervisory Board of Oversight said, the Bretschneider, following a meeting of the Control Committee.

However, there is evidence that the temporary reserve should not be too large, and the construction sample should now be introduced during the first quarter of 2020 at the Bau Office, at the beginning of the year, was planned for this origin.
Hundreds of electric cable misses are still to be accompanied; the Tüv wants to examine this until February. "In order to create the conditions for the adoption of the aircraft, it must continue to work intensively in the processing of the skins," said in a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said, in many cases it goes for lack of evidence, less about new cable. There is no deliverance for all the cable trails in which the cable trails are covered. The airport chief expects that these are present until the end of the year.
Furthermore, the burning protection works not satisfied with the transfer to the train station under the terminal. The problems of the project had been brought to a further crisis three years ago. This time is about smoking smoking smoking in a flight as a slower so that the smoke is not extended. 36 engines should therefore be discussed. This is the beginning of the year to give new attempts to smoke.
Problems with burning protection and other trees, and planning errors have been delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should be operated in 2011. The costs were from two billions from the beginning of 2006 to opening around 6,5 billion euros in the next year.
Because the passenger numbers in Berlin have been significantly increased, the responsible plans for the construction of the airport, and it should take place at a summer meeting of the Supervisory Board on October 18, as the President of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company now searches for two new business leaders. Finance Chef Heike Fölster changes the year's end to the German Bahn, Personal Chef Manfred Bobke-for Camen comes in Rent next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on a fixed feet.

The research project is the largest type of this in German space, shared the University Clinic Hamburg Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. The Queen Foundation promotes the project with EUR 12.5 million. From Switzerland, the high-equipment clinic of Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and participates in the university’s pital Zurich.
Overwhelming, smoking and unreal food includes the essential impacting risk factors for cardiac cycle diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the comparison between genes and external effects is not sufficiently known. Now the scientists want to compare the complete overwhelming of 8000 healthy people with the UKE of 1000 former patients.
Currently, more than 4000 of about 20,000 relevant human genes have been known in any possible changes of DNA - likened mutations - that was known by the clinic. Each year, some 200 adds to the DNA.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options in terms of precaution, recognition and treatment of heart rhythmus disorders, heart weaknesses and heart infarcts. The data could also be used in the study of other people’s diseases, such as Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University's heart and illness centre.
The Chairman of the Cowne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kuhne (82), also stressed the firm will to use the data to investigate other diseases. The Clinic of the Fundation in Davos has been treated up to all all allergics. Now, on the site, a centre for cardiovascular precision Medicine is produced for bioinformatics. To establish its commitments, the logistics employees said he was organized in Hamburg three years ago and was very thankful to the open hearts of the cardiovascular precision.
The biographics of healthy participants are from Hamburger, who also constituted at the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 probands, the largest local health study of the world is, according to the specifications of the clinic, which is the most local health study of the world. In the rhetoric encryption is strictly covered on the protection of data anonymized, the scientists. It goes to a petabyte (1000 terabonates) to data, said Holger Moch from the University's Spital Zürich.
The heritage of a person today can be decrypted within 24 hours, and the clean expert costs are at EUR 1300. The first gene sequence of the world, which was published in 2001, has also costed several hundreds of millions of euros. The study will begin on October 1, the end of the year 2020 will be analyzed by all 9000 samples.
Nigerian police releases hundreds of mistreated boys
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 murdered and misused boys from a coran school. After the instructions of residential security forces, the schools in the northern Kaduna city and discovered the victims for the part of the teenagers, such as the police speaker Jacobu Sabo. "The victims were mistreated. Some of them were offered to be slaughtered by their teachers," said Sabo.
The kids were maintained under the front of teaching in the Korean and being "excepted". In fact, they were maintained by their teachers under "the most attractive and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. Hundred students, including nine years of age, were in a small room.
The Coran School showed the details for about ten years. The authorities would have taken note of repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents had shown themselves shocked when they were taught about the situations in the Coran School, said Sabo. They hadn't opened anything from the suffering of their children.
In the most Muslim Northern Nigerians, there are many private coran schools. They replace the often unnecessary state institutions. People in the region suffered in a common attack of armed bands. According to the information of the United Nations Refugee Help work in the past 10 months, over 40,000 people cross the borders in the neighbouring Niger.
Angekettet and tortured: Nigerian police frees 400 children from school

The children, all of their children, were at their schools like slaves and were put on chats. Some of them were sexually misused. Televisions showed dismastered and painted students in an acknowledged health situation.
World flight selection: Additional forecasts to Messiss and Klopps Kür
football "not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Mayland, the World Fussball Association Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth food and record.
After Nicaragua's captain explained that he never agreed to the World Fussballer Wheel, other countries have come to the Fifa. Egyptians were not evaluated - with a curious foundation.
In the past years, many of the Fifa has proved that the WM's dubble plans of their President Gianni Children, the general behaviour of different corrupt officials, and the Fif-World Flower's WM has not been in the suspicion of switching unprotected - if you think that the stimulated national train and national membership capitals of membership often in a way of sympathy because, according to objective assessment, it was not the case.
But after Nicaragua's captain has not agreed, he has now added further independence: Egyptians claim that the votes of the National Train Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account.
The Fifa regrets that "the signatures on the electoral forms were not valid and therefore were not valid". The Egyptian association has been contacted several times in order to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudans Trainer also wondered
In the case of Egypt, the Sudan’s association has not agreed as a result of the election. While the sequence is complete in the case of Egypt, the Sudan's association agrees that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic has not agreed as soon as it was finally evaluated: Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané, Virgil van Didio Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote was in the exact way, with signs and official stones of the Sudan Association.
Preferences also stated Capitano Juan Barrera: "Don't agree to the #TheBest2019 Awards. All details on my voice are wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, the Nicaragua football association just agreed in his name.
From the association now, the report: Summit, but of course it was not intended. The completed election documents were "unfortunately" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, were identified in a communication of the association. However, in fact, the second captain Manuel Rosas had chosen. "We take the responsibility for the administrative error," he said in the Communication. Although Rosa and Managers Henry Duarte had agreed for the Messiah, "as it is in the official list of FIFA."
The other cases can check the Fifa in an investigation now, but it stresses that the election process was monitored outside by the PriceWaterhouseCoopers company. As long as Lionel Messi remains the only uninterested winner of the world flightballer and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukrainian Africa: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two random Republicans have opened themselves to an official investigation against the US Presidents and Participant Donald Trump. "I think that the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the United States Body State Vermont, Phil Scott. "It is taken from here by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affairs before being taken action.
Scott said he wasn't surprised by the enthusiasms, and they showed that Trump the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky had once again requested in a phone to investigate the activities of the Democratic Chairman and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have retreated the Trump criticism because of the Whistleblower affairs, only few have recognized inconsistently. Scott's statements are now the first sign of this in the Trumps Party, and Virginia's moderate Governor had already been applied to the Trump Political policy, about the locking of environmental protection rules and the strengthening of immigration rules.
When another random Republicans also said Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, for the investigation. "It's a deep devastating situation," said Baker. "The right action and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and to go on the basis."
Scott and Baker, as a Governor of the United States, formally have no discussion in the anti-trump procedure, which will be decided in the Congress, which is, therefore, symbolically important. However, the first Senators of the Republic of the United States have also expressed the situation critically.
The business could have been in place in the establishment of an official detention procedure against Trump, which the Democratics in the Representative House have announced an investigation, and they put him on the use of powerful misconduct for the purpose of a foreign impact on their own political benefits.
There is no precise schedule for the Office of Representatives, and the majority of the representatives of the House could emphasize a so-called impact, but the decision on a real office was made in the Senate where Trumps' Republicans have the majority, and the perspectives of success of such procedures are therefore less.
Should the shooter at the board of Rackets "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Vienna, they should have forced and murdered in libyan refugees.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she was arrested with the Sea Watch 3 ship and 53 libyan refugees on Borde has not allowed to control the port of Lampedusa. After strong Protest and international criticism, also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen, her home prison was recovered after a few days from a Italian judiciary.
Now there are new severe forecasts against rats. Thus three men who were subjected to torture in libyan refugee pools, with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspicioners are being set up in an accompanying camp in Mexico (Syria), after migrants had recognised their penners in Italy. "We can't exclude it, but themselves have no safe information", said "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben new constructioners of the German Press Agency.
The police was called by the police in Middle September that the suspects were assaulted, killed and even murdered in North Africa. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically discovered and executed by raising, repeated and permanent physical violence," said at that time in the communication.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they can't know exactly who come on to the ships. "We can't scan who are the people. They come without pass," said a new manufacturer. Folder is one of the main reasons why people run from Libya. It is therefore likely that the murders are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that the ship comes."
Italian former Minister Matteo Salvini requested rackets, which was still identified for an illegal immigration aid in Italy.
Musk seeks the extradition record at Tesla
The Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given its electronic auto-concerts with the perspective of new record numbers.
"We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with 100,000 delivery", Musk wrote in a email issued by the Branchen Blog "Electrec" to Tesla employees.
The question is strong, so that Tesla could benefit 110,000 orders, it continued to write in Musks rounds. The challenge is to bring the cars rapidly to the customer. Thus Tesla should offer as far as many resources as possible.
In the second quarter, Tesla had provided a good 55,000 cars and thus reached its best value for almost four months.
Musk needs recursing to achieve its high objectives. 2019 he wants to deliver totally 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this fourth year, six numbers have been required. Especially the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here the winning rates are low. Despite the boom losses.
US Budget Street: Re-financed only a bridge
The new budget year will be started in the United States on 1 October without a general budget. The Senate has followed the Representative House on Thursday and has decided to transit finance until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump in August have joined the increased expenditure limits for the financial year 2020 and 2021, the United States have decided before the new fiscal year started on October 1st, once more without expenditure plans. On Thursday, the Senator has followed the Representative's budget and had yet taken a transitional financing (Continuation Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such decisions, on Monday, on Wednesday, it would be taken to a shutdown, a part of the Federal Office. The President Trump must still enter into force.
Shutdown interrupted
The federal management will now be funded at the level and, in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the end of the year 2019 end, which is not possible for the Congress at the time of the 12 expenditure laws which are given to the various departments and authorities, and therefore the federal administration cannot first benefit from the extensive budget framework for 1.3 Bio. to 1.4.
The Democratics have completed ten of the twelve laws in the Representative House, but the expenditure laws reflect priorities of the Democratics who have no chance in the Senate dominated by the Republics, and also have ten of the eighth expenditure plans, which are more or less ready to be poor to the majority.
The Spirits are mainly on the resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are trying to obtain $12 billion for the wall construction, one of the great priorities of President Trump. Democratics are cut into the wall plans and their financing for other military buildings and projects. The shut-based combat was already shocked in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
The spirits are divided on the wall construction
It is unexpected to how the parties want to approach this issue. Probably as an agreement to all twelve expenditure laws in the coming seven weeks is further extending transitional financing over 21 November, and then a shutdown is not excluded.
In the context of the continuing incapacity of the Congress, some of the twelve expenditure laws at the time, and the pertinent risk of a shutdown wins ideas on the automatization of the process to popularity. Proposal S. 1877 for avoiding Shutdowns, the financing of the Federal Management would continue automatically at the previous year level, connecting the recitality of the parliamentarys and maintaining their wages until the new annual expenditure plans are proposed.
France allows artistic fleet for lessons and Singles
In France, the artistic movement will also be opened by single women and lives in the future: the Paris National Assembly agreed with a majority of the laws of the Government, which all women can take an in vitro relief, and that should lead to a clear increase in demand for anonymous seeds.
The presentation also requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debates, critics had warned in the right place that in the future can grow a number of "children without father" and the French Bishop Conference is against the renewal.
The new arrangement is the part of a bioethic sequence, which defended the Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn as "Chance" for society. It is the modern family where children with only one part of a family or homosexual parents are given. After their opinion, the costs for artificial experiences for all women of social insurance are to be paid.
Prohibition with Sperma of all husbands
With a pretty majority, how the National Assembly returns a amendment, the widows should have access to the specimen of their dead husbands. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artificial "post-mort" movement was allowed. In Germany, there were cases in the past, in which women were complained about the specimen of a murderer. The enemy of the presidency was argued in Paris, then a so-called child was a "spectacular squecksal."
Many deputy members of the Government party La Republic en Mare (the Republic in the movement, LREM) from President Emmanuel Macron and the deputy of the opposition had, however, expressed themselves on the artistic movement with the sphere of the murdered partner, and they pointed out that a widow would be a "double trauma" if the death of her husband still remained unpleasant.
The initiativers of the current amendment proposed are injustice that a widow can be condemned by the specimen of a unknown person, but not with their own partner.
Before now, the artistic freezing in France is only permitted by theerosexual couples that cannot witness children. They must be married or at least two years of life. Buzyn already announced in the summer that the maternality continues to be banned.
In Germany, the art flexibility of all women is theoretically open - for single or lesbian couples, however, it is often difficult.
Counterpayment for climate: call for airline for Uniteds will be lower
A lot of flights to high schools, and therefore, the country wants to make an climate allocation in the future, and the rectors say that they had no money for it, but now they are also under pressure.
The high schools should also be limited to flights. Photo: dpa/Julian Strategy Schules
The discussion before the summer breakfast was held on a climate allocation to flights of universities and high schools. After the country recruitment conference skeptically reacted to a corresponding post from the green-free coalition, the plans are now supported from high schools. In a common statement, the doctors of six Baden-Worldberg Universitys and a padagogical high school for compensation of services. This is the first step of "needly necessary" would also be a broad debate on the ability of flights in their opinion.
Russia reiterates North Korean fishermen
According to the secret service FSB, the arrests should have been illegally covered in Russian waters. 10 days ago, 161 fishers from North Korea were arrested, and then there was a shock between border protectors and shipment. Thus three Russians and a North Korean, the fishermen later injured its serious violations.
The Communist Corea leads to chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were then walking in Russian waters, where the Russian coastal wave is based on their own information on the protection of their multibiological resources patrouilles.
30,000 thinfish swimming click
In the renewed controls, 30,000 tons of fish were discovered and invited by boats. In addition, the details were invited after three fish and two motor boats and entered Suodka and Posjet at Wladiwostok.
The Russian fishermen also had not issued fanc licenses to the northern Koreans, and thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested in this year.
The head of Russian fishing companies' association in the Province of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently condemned high environmental damages by the North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with close synthetic networks that were prohibited in Russia, and they would also have helped small lives from the sea. In addition, the networks would be simply discharged in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
Currently only 18.000: US decrease asylum overall
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with the selected police representatives in the white house.
The most rich country of the earth is shocked against protective demanders: As the Foreign Minister in Washington confirms, the upper limit for legal access of refugees is further declined. In recent times, it is important to receive threatened believers and Iraqi asylum.
However, the US government wants to cut the low-border borders for the adoption of new refugees, but in the year 2020, which is in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, at least 18.000 people should be left in the country as the United States Foreign Minister stated.
The Government of President Donald Trump has triumphated the reception preparation for protective demanders from all the world in the past years.
The higher level of 18.000 refugees would be the lowest since the United States Refugee Programme in 1980. However, the United States's foreign ministers called "the most complete and most strict nation in the history", a formulation which is strongly reminded of the use of the official US President.
A "responsibilities-consciousness" with refugees was intended to declare that refugees can return to their homelands to help them rebuilding there. For his hard course in migration policy, he receives a lot of right by the ambassadors, but there is also massive criticism.
In order to finance a border, Trump had the national emergency. If there is an temporary link between the current measure and the current internal policy developments in the United States Headquarters, it is unwise. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selensky's shopping and a potential threatening official discharge procedure.
The US government wants to concentrate on the inclusion of two groups of refugees in the future: those who are following because of their faith - and Iraqi who have helped the United States military in the country, and have been threatened by how the Declaration of the Foreign Minister is declared, which should be included by Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador by a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The United States wants to achieve that, in particular, people from this "North Trieck" Mediterranean in other countries of Asylum, which have only concluded with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements in order to register migration to the Southern American border in Mexico.
The Court orders the release of persons from Zoo to
A people-Utan-Women has been registered on the demands of the Argentinan justice from the former Zoo of Buenos Aires in a Headquarter for Humans in the United States. In 1986, the "Sandra" born in Rostocker Zoo, "Sandra" was deemed the rights of a "non-human person", so it was forced to be released. The animal was put to Dallas, but not as a passenger, but in the fraud room as the lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez declared.
Since the 53 kilograms of serious human economy is not able to adapt the life in the wilderness, it is to live in the future in the free of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more people and 31 smuggles, including "Bubbles", former household of Popster Michael Jackson. "Sandra" is still a 40-day quarentane in Sedgwick Zoo in Wichita in Cansas in Florida.
"Sandra" passed after her birth in Rostock a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelenkirchen before she was entered into Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 strict animal protection process on "Sandras" fundamental rights has helped to transform the Zoo of Buenos Aires into an ecopark.
Register for Swiss Extremberg Level: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme hills, Dani Arnold, are nearly 3.000 meters higher skin in the Italian alpen, a new husarenit.
Without the network, double land or other tools, the Swiss was 550 meters high of the big wine in a new record time.
Beat with Jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute swimming freedom, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the resort. Thus he took the old Bestmark for almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now recorder in Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important European walls.
Nike benefited from new online marketing strategy
The US Sports manufacturer Nike has produced a significant advantage of the trade conflict with China. The net profits increased at $1,4 billion in the past quarter of $1,3 billion (approximately 1,3 billion). This is more than 25 percent in the past period, as the concerts shared on Tuesday. In particular, it is the new marketing strategy "Nick Direct", with the Adidas Concourant online turns to its customers.
In the three-month period until the end of August, 10.7 billion dollars. The Nike sales paid more than 22 percent in China. This also benefited the Concerts of Beaverton in the United States Body State of Oregon from its approach to directly establish consumers through the Internet or Smartphone Apps.
Financial Chief Andy Campion announced that with strategic investment, Nike will continue to advance the "digit transformation" of the sport manufacturer and build its advantages of competition. The investors reacted with the quarter numbers - the shares of the sport manufacturer were over five percent.
Lifelanges Station prohibition for racism in Italy
For racist comments on football prophecy Juan Jesus by AS Rome, the United Nations from the capital of Italian city was a long-term stadium ban against a fan. The defender of the Brazilians was struck by the fan on instagram. Jesus published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma you already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Stolz to be who I am," wrote the 28th Jorge, which since 2016 at AS Rom played.

The racism is a problem in the Italian football. Normally skandal Italian fans of racism against black players rivalising men. "We cannot have no racism in society or sport. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and it is very serious. You must identify the responsibilities and cut out of the stages," had Fifa President Gianni Infantino said in the weekend. As a result, it was racialized in the real-ligation party between Atal Bergamo and the ACF before Sunday.
However, also for the members of Juventus Turin, it had recently given discussions, and the Italian authorities now had 38 randalizing fans of Rekordmeister Juventus Turin with stadion bans, and four of them should not be involved for a period of ten years, shared the police.
The fans are associated with run-up investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra fans in the area of Juventus. The twenty-five was proposed in other severe pressures, money weights and private violence. The club had put the investigations into role with an indication last year.
The Ultra leaders should stood out Italian media reports behind the black traffic with tickets. They had been "military controlled" for the fancourve, and have had to have pressed Juventus-military workers to come to post-state cards.
Generation Z: Is she really different from Generation Y?
Millenniums are narcistical, generation Z is political - all the years will be considered with strict names. If you look more accurately, the marks are full of contradictions. How do you really describe these labels that you are doing?
"The Kraps are coming!" On September 21, officially started the crap in the Gucheng Sea in Gaochun, with the opening session of 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as it was announced by the Nnjing-Gaochun District Committees.
Gaochun, who is the Southern Exploitant of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental areas. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also the Chinese site of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has an environmental view of ideal conditions with a mixing of "30% mountains, 20% water surfaces and 50% fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all conditions to become rich.

Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks from the end of the sanctions - Trump against
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the United Nations Volunteer Assembly, spoke of an appropriate offer of the United States for sanctions. The United States had, in contrast with discussions with the Tehran leadership, made the end of all sanctions, explained Ruhani on its official website.
However, the US President Donald Trump was opposed to the Iranian Office colleague on Twitter: "The Irani wanted to put up the sanctions against him so that there is a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani declares the event: the Federal Officer Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron had been attended in New York and had struggled that a meeting was held. "And America says I have taken the sanctions", added Ruhani. The type of criminal measures that should be completed has been held at the debate. "And they have clearly said we've taken all sanctions."
However, if this prosecution is not acceptable, the criticized Ruhani. In view of the existing criminal measures and "the dismissed atmosphere of the maximum pressure" no one can predict the start of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Kanzler Angela Merkel took place with Ruhani in New York. In the context, the hope of the European people to save the nuclear agreements negotiated with the Iranian and the Islamic Republic was to develop nuclear weapons. President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with President Donald Trump with the United Nations.
Black earthquake near Istanbul - Fast 200 Travellers
After the western Turkey was shocked within a short time of two earthquakes, the fear of a catastrophy increased. 34 people were injured at the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the beach was nearly 200 afternoon, the Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed by security reasons. Hundred buildings were damaged. The earthquake of 5.8 had been shocked on Thursday the Marmara region before Istanbul, and the Panic was dissolved in the millions of meters. Now the government wants to set a Commission to prepare a better country on earthquake.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been prepared sufficiently on beasts, said Ethanbuls Citizens Meister Ekem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the late danger is always ignored. Each year, the bad housing houses are struck - among other murders made by the many smaller earthquakes that are regularly shocked by Istanbul.
City planners such as the famous architects Mucella Tekici have been warned for many years that large open areas in the centre have been built as refugees. First on the 20th anniversary of the Goltrek Bedew in August, the building chamber of Istanbul warned that estimated a million buildings in Istanbul would not be safe.
The Epicentrum of the beach from Thursday was located in the maritime sea in front of the Silivri district and around seven kilometers deep, as the Afad Protection Authority shared. A smaller neighbouring surrounded a few minutes later for more panics on the streets.
The Istanbulan Citizensman Ekem Imamoglu was first not reported on Twitter, loss or damages. The stateman of TRT showed people cut from the panics of the houses. Schools were taken from the Silivri district from security grounds. Some students wined as they were seeing images.
It is particularly threatened to the earth; under the maritime sea, a section of the so-called Northanatolic disaster is marked by the borders between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth Platt. Turkey will always be shocked by earthquakes. One of the most dead was the beast in the nearest of Istanbul in 1999.
For researchers, fear that a earthquake of 7.1 to 7.4 might threaten. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is not clear. At the earthquake on Thursday, the west of the country and Istanbul again was found.
firms have developed emergency plans, private bags, so called Go-Bags with all the needs ready to be packed next to house doors, and schools contribute to children as they have to take place when the earth wakes. When the next big beast comes, be unclean.
The Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slightly. The Estonian citizensman Exem Immoglu followed the developments of the Istanbulan Catastrophe Coordination Center (Acom). After this information, two miners of Moscheen in the area of Acilar and Sariyer.
Warning for neighborhoods in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users reported to panic. buildings watched. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone guides were interrupted. It was stronger than the service day, writes a user. The chief of the Turkish red halfmonds, Kerem clinic, warned by Twitter, called the people to stay close to the buildings that had caused visible damages.
The time of the beast is specified according to official information at 13.59 p.m. only a few minutes after the first beach, CNN Turkey has been given a post that has been given with a strength of 4.0 on the direction scale.
First, on Thursday, a earthquake of strength 4,6 had shocked the Turkish maritime region - it was to see it until Istanbul. The Epicentrum also has located in the Marameer west of the millions of meters, the Afad Protection Authority has already shared on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that was careful for slaughter lines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also taken by a serious earthquake.
For researchers, it's noted that it could come to a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the swimming between the Tekton plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that they will eventually be dismissed - and massive damage.
The earthquake researcher Ersoy calculates that the earthquake is now a warning. If it became more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "This might be the signs of a larger earthquake", he said Ersoy to sender. "Free or later the great beast will come."
Preparing a few weeks ago, the beast also solved great concerns in Istanbul. In Albania it had also given a strong earthquake just a few days ago - it had been 68 injured.
Parliament: New Industrial fuel in Ukraine
Two brinthetic documents are to ensure new substances in the Ukrainian affairs for possible use of powerful misconduct by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible official detection procedure, the US democrats will increase: the complaints sent by an anonymous referendum on the Trump and its surrounded phone at the Ukrainian President's main points for investigation against the Presidents. Trump itself seems more than one of the victims of a "Hexenjagd". Furthermore, he had the credibility of the Whistleblower.
U.S.: United Airlines Airport locked in Toilet - Flighted shipping

In a video distributed on the Internet, which says the US media of 1554, it is to see how many people try to free the woman. "We work at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, OK?", says a man. The aircraft regreted himself at all flights. Open was opened first if the woman gets a delay.
The coke lake: From Kafka inspired: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman

McEwan was quoted with the words: "When the parliament is closed, the government cannot be requested in a critical moment if the Minister is unfairly lie as the Soviet leader, if the Brexite leaders in high positions were to flee the disaster of a No Deal, then a writer must ask what he can do. It's just a answer to write." From McEwan was just a machine in the early year of the Roman "Motors like I" about art intellectation.

Thomas Cook: All trips up to 31.October
The German Traveller Thomas Cooke, a day after his insolvency request, has decreased all travels, including 31 October 2019. Travellers could not be "insolved with insolvent reasons", shared the company on Thursday.
This also concerns the bookings of the Marken Thomas Cook Signatura, Thomas Cook Signatura Finest Selection, Neckermann travels, OGER TOURS, Bucher travels and Air Marin, who are already paid or fully paid. How it is about traveling starting from 1 November 2019, the company stops open. In vote with the insolvency insurance is checked the further step.
Thomas Cook in Germany was in the pool of the British Mother's Congress and made an insolvency request at midnight. The company, among other Neckermann travels, view tours and bucher travels, is employed in Germany for about 2000 people.
Safety wants to send hotels back to money immediately
Instead, from this Friday Hotels in the Foreign, which are still hosting Thomas cook holidays, the money from the Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are associated with the condition that holidays are not requested for additional orders.
Based on booking information and without special accounts, the hotels should now receive 50% of the following payments, as a Zurich speaker of the German Presse Agency said. "This applies immediately and under the conditions that Thomas cook travelers of these hotels are immediately not immediately requested or needed for individual payment of hotel accounts."
The insurance reacted to the reports of hotel guests who were able to pay their accommodations on their own place, and some have to put up more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres were criticized.
As many hotels have been involved, the insolvent traveller will be agreed on Friday with the insolved traveller, said the insurance speaker. According to details on Thursday, 70 000 Thomas-Pauschalu vacants from Germany were still insured. The Zurich Germany has made a vacation and return to Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to continue in Germany and find a future solution to three Thomas cook companies.
However, the current announced payments to hotels by the Zurich Insurance helps only travellers who are still walking. For Thomas Cook clients who want to fly in the holidays, it seems bad. On the late Thursday, the company shared all trips to include October 31, which also decreased for such bookings that were already paid.
As to travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company has been opened. In vote with the Insolvency Insurance Insurance, the further procedure is tested, it was called. In particular, it is responsible for this case also for the insurance of the insurance. The sale of new travels is stopped. dpa.
The company refers to the Surich insurers that can be presented by the company Caera. customers may inform the possibilities of repayment of the travel price and apply their requirements on the Caera website.
Prince Harry destroyed splengmine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry continues the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa he now walks directly on his mother's sights.
With a blue slipler protection weight, the British prince Harry in Angola has cut a spring mine and destroyed.
In a camp of the British Halo Trust at the Dirico place, he took the quarter of the TV cameras on Friday morning. In safe removal, the spring body explosed in the Savanian country without damage. Although only the Halo strip has destroyed more than 100,000 decades of blue conflicts in the African country, there are still more than 1000 mining fields that are threatening the population.
On the fifth day of his African trip, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the springs of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same splengismester, who first joined his mother, he wanted to turn back to the way she went. The pictures on which Princess Diana 1997 went through a spacious mining field were going to the world. She also showed support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have since Monday on a ten-day African journey that began in the South African Tourist Pole Capstadt.
Stockende Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains akt
In fact, Primer Boris Johnson was clearly determined: it will not guarantee a third decrease of the Brexit negotiations; but what sentences can be carried out at the polarising Brits from eternal duration. The recent sentence of the Supreme Court in Britain would be as a hamoklelee over the Blondsshop. His sustainability of Parliament to carry out its Brexit course until the date of arrival has been annuled, and the recent sentence of the Supreme Court in Britain, which was adopted by Johnson, in case of the EU negotiations on 31 October.
Boris Johnson keeps the deal for it
However, the pressure seems not to be spoilable to go to Johnson, and in this way he made it possible for the visit of a hospital and that, in the case of non-classification until the end of October, he supported negotiations:
You know, we'll hold up the law.
At the same time, however, we are convinced that we will leave the EU at 31 October.
I'm carefully optimistically that it's crazy.
And the time of the Brexit Manufacturers in Brussels is all over six weeks, and the EU and the British Prime Ministers have the time to prevent the end of the European Union without agreements, but the recent discussions have no interruption. A agreement seems more difficult to be present until the end of October. The British Prime Minister does not have the law, it is a renewing date of arrival, but the opposition of the Prime Minister is not concerned. Johnson is not afraid that in the case of a No-Deal Brex.
U.S.: Additional death accidents by e-Zube
The number of losses related to the use of e-smoking in the United States has increased to twenty-five. In addition, 805 in this connection, the US Health Authority shared the CDC. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine has already been more than 900 affected, confirmed about 500 of them. The cause for liver damages is still unexpected. In Europe, there is not yet a similar increase in leakings. The applicants seem to be limited to the users in the United States.
The fear of new protests in Egypt increases
A million times, Mohammed Ali's videos were shared in online networks. The manufacturers and players in Spain calls for a "volks revolution". For the volks revolution today, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Egyptian militarys who offer critical corruption and misconduct. Ali is expected to join with a million participants in central places of the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Kairo, there was already a strengthened police presentation. several U-Bahn stations remained closed, switched roads around the central Tahrir plate. In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls, and the hands of footgrounds were divided on news and photos related to the protesters.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir plate.
Last weekend, it came to protest with hundreds of participants in Kairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, and such an open protest had not been given in Egypt for many years. Successfully reacted to the security forces. According to information on human rights organizations of human rights Watch (HRW) almost 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them had been recently arrested - only because they were "for a false time in the wrong place", they shared HRW with lawyers.
The organization also criticized the centre in the North African country, and then blocks the government in Kairo websites and online services to bind further protests against al-Sisi. The General governments the country since 2013 after he has destroyed the elected Islamic president Mohammed Mursi.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs of Grönland-Expedition
The Polarforscher Arved Fuchs was returned on Friday by his Grönland expedition. He was welcomed at his arrival in Hamburg port, including the Skipper Boris Herrmann, Greta Thunberg, with the "Malicia" renjacht over the Atlantics.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs studied and documented the consequences of the earthwarming in the past months on his "Daagmar Aaen" ship on the coastal islands and Greece.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He has waited for years to report the young generation to words. It was known for decades that the earth was warming. However, many of them were as a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often found out of publicity," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of the earthwarming and the destruction of the sea. When the expedition was avoided by a drone of Greece and was pesed with microplastics, it was called.
For his "fight for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's sea", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was a great example in the Hamburg climate dinner with the "Seadevcon Maritime Award". "For all those who live in the heart of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the prices. "He is a witness of changes that have been given in the arctics in the last decades."
There Spaghetti in Rome: Tourist payments for Nudeln 430 euros
430 euros for two tears Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near England in Rome: This seemed to be too much Japanese tourists. The account of 80 euro drink payment was included by the two women, however, they posted the leave on Facebook, which was able to react.
"Solche cases are harmful to the view of Rome. We call the police to answer the question whether it is a fraud," a speaker of Federation requested the association of travel leaders in Rome according to the Roman Day Journal Il Messaggero (Freeday Exhibition).
Soon the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese were not only appointed by Spaghetti but also for fresh fish, the local owner justified. However, this is not to take from the account. A drinking payment from up to 20 percent of the account was normal, the guest said.
A call in Ukraine, and it's all over? President Donald Trump, US President, could be faced with the turbulent enthusiasms of the past days with an official detention procedure, which democracy wants to examine the investigation in the Representative House as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision falls.
At the beginning of the skandals, the phone at the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj, which has recently taken the discussion on national security and the democracy of the United States with its complaints, is monstrous: the President has misused his office to instrumentize the government of another country to influence the election 2020. He has used the dependance of Ukraine in this way and wants to strive to act against a political enemy.
The kernel of this project is also to complete the infringement of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not return to the complete word. The phonemat of 25 July is only an episode of a more larger history, in which the centre is mainly next to the Trump attorney: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes from the view of the public in May 2019 its beginning when the New York Times of Reiseplanes in Ukraine reports. He wants to meet in Kiev with the elected President Selenskys, and the lawyer itself knows that his purposes are very heavy. "We do not take us into a choice that we're missing in a finding which we have the right," says the newspaper. You can think it's unlikely, but "daran is nothing illegal."Juliani wants to be followed in Ukraine for the investigations that there is no basis, "for this information is very helpful for my people to be helpful for my government."
The lawyer and former New York citizensman seems to have been infected with the right conspiration officials that have been fixed on Trumps' opposition in 2016: Hillary Clinton has conspirated with actors in Ukraine, said at the time, to build a case for Russian employees in the United States. However, this proposal was never serious.
This is exactly the investigation of the Trump in July on the phone with Selensky, which says: The former Vice-President and the current candidates for the Presidency of the Democratics, Joe Biden, have been the Ukrainian Officer of Obama to resolve the former Ukrainian General Officer Wictor Schokin. However, to stop the investigation of the Gas company in the Board of Supervisory, the U.S.H.A. had financed U.S.A. to finance the corruption of his family.
Indeed, the end was something different. When Joe Biden requested that the Ukrainian general lawyer should go, the investigations against the gas company were already closed, the shocks were never directly affected. Scokin was also proposed the most corrupted shocks that the US government was not the only western partner who was on his discharge. In the past, the Obama government was even expressly supported the findings against the company.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disorders at Instagram and Facebook. In particular, Germany, England and Spain are involved. The users report that Facebook has not always been loaded since about 15.30 p.m. Instagram also shows that the error message could not be loaded. Whatsapp seems to be affected by the distortion, even if not even at the same time.
Instagram and co. opening of disorders
It is not the first massive crash in this year. Provided in March and July the services were deleted for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also turn back to Twitter first to make their bad air.
Polish scientists in Antarctica saved
Three Polandian scientists were saved from the chilean air weapons from the ice of Antarctic. They were with a shooting boat in the way and several miles away from their base as their motor paid. They had lucky in unfortunately - less than one hour needed the chilean saving shooter for the conversation.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4 Chile air responsibilities:
"As 9:30, we received the message for a short time before we started, and a good 20 minutes later, we were over the smoke boat."
From 1977 on King George Island, Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists worked there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NIE load without cable
Practical, but harmful
Indutive technology through Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
As far as several new smartphones have been on the market, supporting cableless downloads and sell themselves very well - all before the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to call a study of early July in memory. The free load of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not appropriate.
High temperature set to battery
Scientists are warned before the unclean load of Smartphones. This is, according to the knowledge of the University of Warwick devices, extremely harmful for the devices. For this reason, it is the significant increased heat development. A phone is loaded by cable, the battery is up to three hours on 27 degrees. In cableless loads, the researchers themselves have been measured in the perfect direction of the smartphone on the ladepad. It is still measuring over 30 degrees. Leaves the phone somewhere beyond the shuttle, increases the temperatures even higher.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researcher, the temperature is a crucial factor for the stopperability of batteries. This is because each degree plays a role. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery is not only to the capacity but also not so long. The life period is lower. The researchers reason to load the smartphone always by cable. As a battery is always connected with the costs of modern smartphones, the app has a free switch. At last, the costs for a battery still increased.
Practical
The technology is extremely pleasant:After launching the device on a suitable shop - they are already already in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery will be loaded without quiet coffee salt and powerful steel flights. As it is for Qi (inductive energy transmission) a global standard, where even apple is soon, there is little limitations. However, the machine should only be used by the researchers in derogation.
Everest-Stau photo: 13 8 thousand in six months
A Nepalese mountain increase has reached its own information within only six months 13 of the 14 higher mountains in the world. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the pitches of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, shared its expedition event.
The former soldier wants to reach all 14,000 months in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international slaughter lines: from him is a photo of mountain increases that are on the Mount Everest Slange.
The image of the Massenand Rand solved a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meters higher mountains and the highest crowd of the earth. In May, 11 clusters died within a few days.
A problem for Purja may be the relief of the 14th-eighth thousands: China's authorities now learn the Xxabangma Berg in Tibet. As a result, it is called in other bad weathers. In the first week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to him.
Four all elephants on Sri Lanka found
Among the dead animals are also a tragic elephant cup, a police speaker shared on Friday. "We thought that the elephants were infected."
The four castles were found in a protective area near the famous and visited by many tourists by Sigiria, and the animals were probably the police speaker between 15 and 25 years of age. It was ordered an autopsie to determine the cause of death.
At Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The killers are often farmers whose country had prematurely observed the animals. Similarly, about 50 people of elephants are killed annually. This is usually if the animals are driving near their living space villages.
In Sri Lanka, estimates live only about 7.000 elephants. The death penalty is theoretically.
Conserved British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British Oil Tanker "Stena Impero" left more than two months after his establishment by Iran the port city of Bandar Abbas. This gave the seaquarter of Bandar Abbas known according to the news Agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolution Gardens had established the tanker under British flags on 19 July under the provision to have undermined the rule of sea law in the Persian Golf.
Thomas Cook management in the Critics
The competent Economic Committee of the Subcommittee wants to investigate the role of the traveling Thomas Cook, which is to go as well as to the question why the British Government would not contribute financially to the surviving companies. "We are interested in supervision in the company as well as in the control of external books", the President Rachel Reeves in London shared. "Openly we have to do it with a very example of management managers."
According to experts, genes are exceededed at dark cancer risk
The role of the gene in the family increased dark cancer risk is obviously overlooked. In this conclusion, researchers of the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a current study. Other risk factors such as family food habits are likely to be more likely to take more seriously than ever. This has results for calculation of the individual carcinour risk, highlights the DKFZ knowledge.
Elon Musk allows to increase Tesla actions
This writes Musk in a email from the Branchen Blog "Electre" published on Thursday. The question is strong, so that Tesla could use 110'000 orders, it continued to write in Musks rounds.
The challenge is to bring the cars rapidly to the customer. Thus Tesla should provide as many resources as possible.
The employees found the information: Teslas shares went with more than six percent from the trade. Thus the course has not been added for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95'000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high objectives. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. This requires six-year-old numbers. Especially the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are less than the winning levels. Despite the boom's losses.
Will the British government start to Brexit-Get? Johnson back
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he is looking for an environment of the last amended legislation against an unregulated Brexit, and he only said on Friday before journalists that his Government will hold its right to the right.
The law proposes that the government should ask for a movement of the end of arrival, no agreement with the EU should be achieved until October, and Johnson criticizes this as a "capitalization law", which has violated the negotiations with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the conviction on Thursday, Johnson could try to "political skane" to implement the law. Johnson could use a procedure strike that changes the entry into the law at the time after the EU's access.
Johnson said he is trying to adopt a treaty with the European Union. "We are certainly convinced to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is the agreement."
Iran flows clearly Urananship up
Iran's President Hassanō has increased the pressure on the European Contracting Partners in the fight on the saving of the historical nuclear agreement. "The leaders show the European States inability or lack of availability when it goes on concrete action," said the Thursday, at a press conference at the New York Conference on Thursday. For the case they did not agree with their promises, he put "widespread steps" away from the agreements of the possible negotiated agreement of 2015.
The conflict on the international agreement on the prevention of an Iranian atomic bomb, which was contrary to normalize Teheran's economic relations. The United States set out in 2018 from the Agreement with Iran with the "maximal pressure" to a course change in a nahost policy that was an aggressively adverse. The Government of President Donald Trump wants to deal with a new agreement with urgence-related stocks and put back to the hard sanctions against Teheran.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or prepared for the use of Uran at the beginning of September, as well as at least with Uran.
Maybe the Europeans are not ready to put their part in the deal and, therefore, the Iranians left with the costs and the last pressing United States sanctions alone, smoothly, but it will give further discussions, which hopedly have a solution.
Opinion of Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after attacking a significant oil plant in Saudi Arabia in the middle of September, the municipality has changed: Germany, France and Britain followed on Monday of the US appreciation that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi revolts supported by Iran had known to the attack, which was evaluated as a false recognition by the United States. "We have nothing to do to do so," reaffirmed Ms.
"They who were injured these accusities must prove that there should be evidence of this," said Writer. This would have not yet agreed during the UN General debate. Instead, they would only claim that the rebellies in Jemen could not execute a attack like this, in the past days with Federal Cancer Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
For possible discussions with President of the United States Trump, the widely sanctions of the United States administration had to be dealt with, he requested the government in Washington to convert to a policy of "dialog and consciousness".
Commits of other stars crossing the sun system
Astronomims now observe a commit from the deep of the world. This has been before. The committee allows re-locking to other sun systems.
What was just a confusion is now confirmed: an intersystemal guest crossed by our sun system. The commit from the depth of the world was baptized after his discovery on 2I/Borisov and the interest of astronomies in the whole world.
The largest commit was found on the Crime on August 30, by the amateur astronomen Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory, with a self-building telescope of 65 centimeters of diameters. After observing various observers, they confirmed not only that it was an unknown committee, but also showed that it was not from our sun system.
2I/Borisov was only the second interstar object that has been viewed in a flow of our sun systems after 1I/'Omuamua of 2017.
2I/Borisov offers the rare opportunity to obtain astronomies from nearly an extraordinary sun system before he disappeared on a nickel. The first observation shows that the interstel committee of which our own systems are different, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of Canars. "The current speed of the committee is about 150,000 miles per hour, which is clearly above the typical speed of objects that are around the sun", reported about David Farnocchi by the US Radio Authority in a communication.
The comet is also responsible for the appointment and catalogue of the name and categoryization of the name of heavenly bodies. To the honor of his discoverers, the inter-screen Swifsters, which were first conducted under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, the name 2I/Borisov, which indicates that it is the second inter-ethnical object that is found in our so-called system.
The astronoms have been happy: On the contrary to 1I/'Omuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been viewed in the flight. Thus, the researchers remain a few months for research. "The object will reach the greatest light and then see the largest telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "They will only be observed by larger and professional telescopes until October 2020."
several observers have already taken the visitors. Thus a team of Karen Meech from the Hawaii University, who had already led to the characterization of 1I/'Omuamua, has been in a first study the weather diameter of 2 to 16 km. The accommodation of the Gemini observatory on Hawaiii shows a significant swif of the committee.
Scientists and researchers of the Astrophysical Institute of Canarys (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar Sweefster that offers a kind of finger impression of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object distingues the committees of our sun systems, and it knows that the composition must be similar," reported the IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation closes that the compositions in other solar systems could be formed by similar processes as in our complement of León, complemented by León Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two inter-screen visitors within only two years shows that these objects can open a new way to investigate certain solar processes in other solar systems; however, how often such styps are, it is still difficult to deal with. One of the next intersystem visitors may be a planned satellite mission of the European Railway Agency Esa.
The Agency wants to station on a waiting position of 1,5 million miles away from the earth the three-party room zone "Comet Interceptor" (they, some of the coma-depths). It is like to spend the Esa scientist director Sunther Hasinger on an unrelated, fresh coma from our own solar system, or to a intersystemal visitor like 1I/'Oumumamua.
First load on Pekings new Mega-Airport Daxing
Recently before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is so far: At the new Mega airport in the south of the main city of China is a first passenger machine of China United Airlines, a special honor for Captains and Crew.
By 2022, about 45 million flights are to be completed annually, 2025 should be 72 million. Chinese President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of 450 billion projects. The recent Chinese press project will also be called "Seestern" because of its sixth building structure.
The complex has four start- and landway trains that will be extended later to seven and are equipped with the world’s largest automatic transport system. A new U-Bahn transports passengers in only 20 minutes in the town of Peking.
Soon during the building, the Chineses were able to learn from Berlin several times. The opening of the building in 2006 - and significantly smaller - the main airport in Germany has been moved to the same time. Nevertheless, a first passenger machine was in Peking for four years.
New surrounding aircraft is to fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four and a half hours - the British space Agency UK Space Agency is dreaming. It is possible to do this for the over-time flights (Synnergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which developed the company's reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, quoted the US Sender CNN. "This is the technology that could finally be edited", said the Shirp Graham Turnock. "We are talking about the 2030s for the invasion, and the work is very continuing."
In order to go forward the project, the British Railway Agency wants to cooperate closely with the Australian aircraft. A flight from the main city of New York to the Australian Metropolis is now at about 20 hours. As the only overall aircraft for passenger transport, the Congress of 1976 to the establishment of its operation in 2003, the New York City was discovered and used for three to three and a half hours. In 2000 there was an accident on the start of an accident on the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, which had arrived in all 109 invasions. In the past year, the US American Lockland flight manufacturer, known with the US-Radious Aviation Authority, was known to the United States.
"Sabre will make the world more smaller with its high speed-up-to-Punkt-Transport", writes Reaction Engines, among others on its home page. The Sabre Engine could be used for efficient travellers with a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the steel. Additionally, such aircrafts are also available outside the sacred temperature and allow the "first generation of re-useable rail drivers".
Accommodation in Washington: Trump wants to check anonymous tips in Ukraine
In Ukraine's appeal for possible power-use of the President of the United States, Donald Trump wants to observe possible skills in the white house.
"I want to know who has given the information to the Whistleblower," said Trump on Thursday before the United States Embassy workers at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned is nearly a "a spion" and has been changed in the past "a little different" than today.
The event was not public, but many US media distributed audio media on Friday by the conversation. Democratics responded to the statement of the President.
The Democratics in the United States Representative House had announced preparations for an official detection procedure against Trump, which was mainly based on the written applications of an anonymous secret worker, the serious accusions against the Trump and its government centre.
In its work, the Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government employees, as the President of the United States "uses the power of its offices," to achieve that another country is infringed by its profits in the United States 2020.
In the centre of the prosecution, a strict telephone between the Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is encouraging his official colleagues to investigate their political rivals, which could harm his political rivals Joe Biden. This is a former business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine, and an appropriate effort to protect his speech before the Ukrainian justice.
The Whistleblower accused the White House in view of the Ukrainian Telephone also of the debate: Leaders of government workers would try to keep the exact expression of the conversation under the box. How normally a electronic word vocabulary protocol was prepared. This should be published after the discussion on the instruction of lawyers from the white house but from a common data database, which is being stored in a specially protected system.
The identity of the instructor is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it is an employee of the foreign secret service of the CIA.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source. In a series of Tweets to the theme, the President wrote, among others, that "ashing Whistleblower" has distributed information from the second hand that had been unacceptable, so it may have not been a shock or spione.
As Trump was expressed in New York about those who had to have played the Whistleblower information, but resolved, and the Chairman of the United States Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, reacted with anxiety and accused complaint, the integrity of the government was more than once.
In the Representative House, the Commission has been conducted in various committees for various investigations against Trump and its environment. In view of the Ukrainian proposals, the Democratics are now being investigated with a new view to establishing a possible administrative detection procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower gave us a driving plan for our investigation," said the head of the Secret Service Committee in the Representative House, Adam ship. Trump shocked ships, a false vision of the things before him and reiterates the return of the Chairman. Trump was shocked regularly and had already requested the return of the committee for months ago.
More than 300 former US government employees from the security and external policy areas, mostly under democratic, but also under the Republic of the United States, were put on a statement issued on Friday after the possible investigation of the Democratics' investigation.
There is no precise time for the other processers; with the majority of the representative households, democratics could emphasize a so-called execution procedure, but the decision on a real office was made in the Senate where Trumps' Republicans have the majority of them, and the perspectives on success of such procedures are therefore less.
VW: Employees will be decreased
The VW market plans, in which the production continue the costs, could go to the latter of production in Germany and Europe, and this concerns the Builder's operational Council, and the market will depend on its annual manufacturing costs of ten billion euros to 2023 to two billion euros. This is why 500 million euros will be divided in this year.
A key is the staff costs: 2016 between enterprises and the Employment Council, which is negotiated until 2020, already see the decrease of 14.000 jobs only in Germany. In particular, a workplace can only be decreased if almost the related activities are not needed, and a job insurance is also applicable until 2029.
However, as our newspapers are now produced from an operational crisis, jobs in the production, which are not indeed "speaking" on a different way, so on the official course, which would often not be replaced by regular bodies.
In these cases, the Working Council has no possibility to prevent the redistribution.Indeed, it is uncomfortable to many staff to take care of the job depending on a periodic exemption of the vehicle vehicles. In order to ensure that the vehicle production could be delayed by Germany and Europe because they are more favorable in other parts of the world, the VW is only to say: "Alignment of the employment volume is agreed as soon as soon as socially agreed to the graphic curve".
The Marke VW wants to standardize the world's production and control new projects centrally. It also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions, including the objective of increased productivity and the competitiveness. And Andreas Tostmann's production plan said at a management conference in Berlin: "Graduate in insecure times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the United States and China, we are well advised to make us a crisis."
For example, in this way it was already successful: for example, in this year, for example, the production costs for vehicles are the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Tostmann said that the production period for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfburg for 1,1 hours. Exacted numbers call VW not, according to the information of our newspapers it is in the Golf 7 around.
20 hours.
Our region is the only VW-fabric of Wolfsburg, which is produced in the vehicles. The works of brain swimming and salt guitters are produced. For Wolfsburg, the VW-internal rules apply that there are 800,000 cars to be built annually so that the work is satisfactory. 2018, the extradition in Wolfsburg was only 700,000 vehicles - prescribed by the slightest essential demand and the problems in the conversion of the new consumption and gas test process WLTP.
However, as Tostmann's production system has been announced last year, a million cars in Wolfburg are to be rolled "perspective" in the band, which is intended to make it possible to switch the golf production in the stamwork - because Zwickau work is refining the location for the e-auto-production.
Furthermore, SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfburg. However, the sales numbers of Golf and Tiguan have recently been developed. Hence, the expectations on the Golf 8.

Ufo requests negotiations with airhansa
FIm Sustainable Street with the Air Hansa Concern has once again threatened Ufo with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiations table, the company will inform "a 14 October on the workshop measures in the LH Congress," Daniel Flohr shared the Ufo Tarif Force on Friday. Airhansa and her daughter Eurowings have been delayed for months to conduct Ufo Tarif negotiations with Ufo. In addition, it is the question of whether the company has advised the tariff contracts to the airhansa.
In this regard, Ufo now appears to be strengthened after a decision of the Francfurt law. Airhansa wanted to make sure that the tariff contracts were not proclaimed. The Court reaffirmed the applications. The company confirmed the decision and tested the laws. "The second court looks out the matter all different, I think unlikely," said Ufo-President Flohr.
In August, the airhansa has also submitted an application to the country working court Frankfurt to check the status of the Ufo as a association. The company argued that the company hasn't set up a delegation responsibilities for months and is not able to play its role as a tariff partner.
In the past, a strong leadership goes back to the section work, in which many members of the board and the board, including the long-term head of work Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had, for the doubt, adopted an already initiated decision on the strike of the cobine staff at Eurowings at the end of July.

Eberesque and wild Roscania threatened
In Germany, most of them were threatened by Ebereschen (Sorbus), said one of the authors David Allen, the German Press Agency. "The majority are threatened because the populations are small, or through the transformation or weakness of their lives."
It seems very bad for the common Russians. It's being " dangerous" since 2017, two phases of the IUCN scale. The largest threat is located next to a pillar of the Balkan minimode. It has been widened by the Southern Europe over the whole continent and has no natural enemies.

The slippers like sleeves played a key role in recycling nutrients on the ground and are a major food source for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation of many overwhelmed and underestimated species is precarious to form the ecosystem of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, Director of the European Union of IUCN. "We have to limit the effects of people on our ecosystems and make priority to the protection of these species."

The Head of the US Internet Communications Commission (FCC), Aiit Pa, warned the federal government to trust the Chinese network operator Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too large," said Pad the "Handelsblatt" with regard to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which is obligation to follow the instructions of the security bodies of each company under Chinese law.

French Financial Minister: "Germany must invest and now"
The French Economic and Financial Minister Bruno Le Maire has called Germany to increase investment in order to increase the economic growth in the euro area.
Germany has to invest, and now, as soon as possible,," said Le Maire on Thursday at the presentation of the French budget for the next year.

Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson no question about Brexit tactics
The British Primer Johnson criticizes the "capitalization law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament has returned to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos brex, but the critics are afraid that Boris Johnson can still use a slug, and this is what the Tory policyers say.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is aware of whether he wants to implement an unregulated brexit - despite the last legislation decided by the Parliament, which is to prevent it exactly, just as Johnson said to journalists, his government will hold its right to the right.
The law proposes that the government should ask for a movement of the end of arrival, no agreement with the EU should be achieved until October, and Johnson criticizes this as a "capitalization law", which does not delay the negotiations with the EU.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister John Major was able to try to put Johnson a "political scanner" in order to implement the law. The First Minister could set a procedure strike that turns into force of the law on the time after EU agreement. Johnson said he tried to adopt a treaty with the European Union. "We are certain to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Johnson's chief advisor dominic Cummings stated that he accepted the political discussions on the Brexit as "Spacing in the park" and showed himself that the aimed EU access was still coming: "We enjoy that we will win, we will be (e.g. Red.: emerge from the EU) no concern," said the British newspaper "Telegraph" according to a book view.
Cummings, who led the Brexit Campagne "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the EU Referendum 2016, now functions as Chief Strategy in the British government Hall Downing Street, which is to shoot the uncompromissable policy that the Primer has led to a slightly free situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" of Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they were all standing before the camera of Linda McCartney, who became one of the large rock photographs. But it must not always be the great love. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Tazen) looks a deep in the entire private world of McCartney's family.
Paul McCartney, who was married from 1969 to Lindas, in 1998, was obvious and encouraging when he presented the "The Polaroid Diaries" band in the middle of September in Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In the illustrating guests also belonged to Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretender-Frontfrau Chrissie Hynde.
After the Launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is an extraordinary view in life of an extraordinary family from time before instagrams, a party to the bearing of LindaMcCartney as an engaging artist and the emergency magie of the polyroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied the art history at the university of Aizona until she found a photograph, the camera was always there. Thousands of polyroids have done it, some hundreds of these are now published in the "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, styles, landscapes, several hasters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interestors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "He wanted real moments," writes the artist Ekow Eshun in his term. And of course, there is still another one in the middle point: your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him.
When he danced with his daughter Mary on the shoes, he calls in the bathroom with a sweet on the head, or takes unfair moon boats. Truly, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but there was a part of the swimming light on their farm in Southern Greatland or Scotland also leading to a very normal life. So Mary McCartney said that she had been sleeping as a baby in a bed that had been buried with her father from old carton shops. And it was not always in the McCartneys.
As unlike other media, the Polioraid camera starts the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's inceptions are certainly a family daybook, but they are much more than clean shoes.
It's about the decision click: you've got to know if a great photo happens before you. And then you have to kick it exactly at the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you can get two seconds ago or two seconds ago, it may be a completely different photo." And Linda had the gift to start exactly the right moment. "He knows that she had it," said Paul in the Eshun-Essay.
As a result, the light, the composition, the image distribution and the colors, which "The Polaroid Diaries" makes not only a maintained book for Beatles-Fans but also a great athletic winner, where landscapes have also been affected as astray. The perfect addition to the Beatles-Album, which is just set up for 50 years ago.
"We'll buy further oil and gas from Iran."
The Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday, Turkey could not abandon the import of oil and gas from Iran.
We will purchase our earthquake from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN Volley Meeting.
However, it was noted that Turkey had problems in the import of Iranic terrestrian imports, as some companies had been "for the United States drugs".
However, Turkey will "prosecute, especially in this issue and in many other questions, our relationship with Iran," said the Turkish President, who has repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since the international Atomic Agreement with Iran has been a policy of the "maximal pressure" towards the Islamic Republic, the United States follows a nuclear programme in the secret and does not hold the agreement.
Their sanctions have caused Iran's oil export and a serious economic crisis in Iran, and in the past months the decline in the Golf region has significantly increased.
US government wants to limit the inclusion of refugees
The United States government wants to be drasticly limited to the registration of refugees, and the United States Foreign Minister stated on Thursday that the annual overwhelming level of a new-site programme is to be deleted from 30,000 to 18.000 refugees, which corresponds to a total of 40%.
The Foreign Minister stated that the United States would continue to be obliged to support refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve the US citizens.
The United States government wants to concentrate on the inclusion of two groups of refugees: people who are following because of their faith - and Iraqi who have helped the United States military in the country, and have been in danger, as the Declaration of the Foreign Minister, which is called by Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, must be included by a maximum of 1500 refugees.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UNO camps are selected in all the world and newly settled in the United States. 18.000 refugees for the financial year 2020 would be the lower in the history of the programme. As the current overwhelming level of 30,000 is a deep value. When the President of the US Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the white house, was about 85,000.
Help organizations responded to the announced decrease of the top limit. "This is a very tragic day for America," said the Chief of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The United States would continue to suffer their leading role in protecting the most vulnerable people of the world.
Trump tries to limit immigration to the United States - legally as illegal - strictly. The US government expects its own details for the coming financial year 350,000 asylums. These figures are separated from the new registration program.
Donald Trump - "Come a spot near"
The President of the US Donald Trump has regarded the Whistleblower officers. Whoever has always proposed the informant who offers powerful abuse to him has changed the corresponding indication "Come close to a split," Trump said in a recording of a private event on Thursday in New York. This report corresponds to several US media.
Thus Trump said to workers of the United Nations mission. When he was asked after the person who informed the Whistleblower about struggling operations in the white house, he said: "This comes near." Then the Trump added: "We know what we did in old times when we were broken? Right. The Spione and Verrat, we made a little different action than we do now."
The observers referred the last comment on the possible impact on death penalties. Democratics had a degree criticism to Trump's statements and have prompted a deterioration of the Witnesses. It is also an attempt to undermine a congress survey to a possible official decision procedure, writes the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Surveillance in the Representative House.
The Whistleblower proposes the President's complaint to have a misuse of his office in a country in the United States Whale 2020. It is, among others, to conduct his surrounded phone with his Ukrainian official Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: in the conversation, the trumpet closed to him to investigate his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son in Ukraine. Trump holds every failure.
It is still clear that those who are both the Whistleblower themselves and their informants are. As the New York Times reports, it should be an analysis of the foreign secret service of the CIA.

A US rockband The Who has found a deep end because of an inadequacy of Leadsmenger Roger Daltrey. In the mid-wednesday in Houston, his voice was in the service. At the eighth song, Daltrey said to the public: "I think I should leave it as long as it works."

Location immediately set: WeWork allow real estate markets to sit
WeWork was the largest officer in New York.
Within less than years, WeWork increases the small startup to driving force on the most costly real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in the crisis. The shippers need to fear milliarity income.
The crisis of the officer WeWork threatens the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had left the reasons for Adam Newmann as a chief to move the planned busgang and to sell daughter companys and values as the private board for the leadership forces to win the financial space for the coming weeks and months.

In this year only the mileage costs will always be estimated by the allocation of new large fields to assess 2.5 billion dollars. In order to limit the loss, the new company has to be limited to the current emergency and the new switch switch of the floors.
According to the "Financial Times" WeWork has concluded in the period of up to 15 years with obligations of more than 40 billion dollars, not only for the company itself and its investors, but for all the real estate markets.

Only WeWorks ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the new markets in this time. Without WeWorks Expansion, the Office Learning in the US-Metropole would be held in this period, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider".
In the main city, the balances in the real estate market could also be seen without any further expansion of the aggressive startup. WeWork, among otherwise, is the headmaster, in a year old by the Spain fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros purchased office houses in the center of the Finance Metropolis.
Many employees have made their real estate for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. Devil WeWork to make its business model soon profitable, the real estate owners should be able to subscribe a part of the expected billion income. Access to the - without any swimming - reserves of WeWork have not even the long-term meal contracts. Because the allocation of the individual locations of WeWork is regularly followed by every extra-based household, such as the special purpose Vehicles, for the mother society only in the borders and the borders.

The Demonstrates were also assembled before the white house in Washington.
How large the world's access to this Friday after recording, it is relatively unclean. Thunberg itself was good things. " Last Friday, over four million people have led to the climate. This Friday we do it again," she wrote on Twitter. As long as it had given 6383 actions in 170 countries.
In particular, in Germany, the past Fridays for Future was very large. A good third of all world demonstrates - about 1,4 million - had been estimated by Fridays for Future in 575 German cities. In this time, a list of movements are planned for at least 65 cities. In Metropolians such as Berlin, Hamburg, München and Colonia, but also in smaller communities and cities as Jews in Northern Western and Western countries are planned to go to the climate people.
In the age of 15 years, Thunberg was placed before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to demand its country to increase the use of climate protection, and in a short period, the Fridays for Future movement has been made, especially students and students, but also more scientists and other adults.
They are in common calling for more honor to combat the earthquake and the threatening climate disaster from the policy, especially in accordance with the Paris climate Agreement, the global warming should be under 1,5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial time.
Thunberg was attended just a month ago after a two-week transatlantic troops with a high-zeater renard in New York, where she had finally participated in climate protectioners and meetings of the United Nations. On Monday she held an emotive talk to the UN State and Government Heads of the Earth. In her home Stockholm, she was talking to her use for more climate protection of the Nobel Price of the Law Live.

New World Climate Protests of Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protections, thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
The movement of Fridays for Future renewed actions and unions in twelve countries to end an international climate trail.
In Germany, Protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in Metropolies such as Berlin, Hamburg, München and Köln, but also in smaller communities and cities such as jungles in Northwest-Westphalen or Western country in Sylt. Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large accommodation in the Canadian Montreal.
Climate Protests ✔ Who are Thunbergs Interms?
Justice and courage are, even in the 21th century, a world full of wars and fuming manufactures that warm the climate. As a surpriser that a 16-year-old girl has the powers of this time to hold the spiegel before the nase. But what is in this way? Is it helping or marketing a climate activist? History Master Service or manipulative tactic for himself?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg moves the massas and brings young people to swim for a better climate world. It is historically not seen the first time in Europe that a young man creates a congregation of children and youths to win for himself. In 1212, a child named Nicoleus from the Coleon has feeled excited to make himself a world more fair. Then he has also made a sharp to young people who can win for themselves, and it is able to overcome the sea to reach in the land that has been slowly made in America.
But this is about a shadow page? Why is it necessary for a action named "We don't have time" to save the world? Moreover, Greta Thunberg has a rich PR-manager on her side. Nevertheless, her mother has published a book that has been wipedly sold by the daughter in the ramp light. An old-selected followers of Greta Thunberg had a little deceptive about the last PR show, or. The travel with the ship probably had some follow-ups. This is also unreasonable because the action came in the world's media so well-related followers, and it was a lot of money in the action.
Here the Spirits are divided: is morally proper to the savings of the world financially? Is it still authentical if some people's creatures work together with the World Management Association with the Börsenmakers? At the same time, what position will finally be addressed to a critical and reflected point of view is always more important in a democracy-precised society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore it may also be likely to make a sense from the projects of certain trends to answer critically.
Compet discover: Intersteller guest crossed by our sun system
A foreign commit crosss our sun system at the moment.
The confusions of the astronoms have confirmed themselves: a foreign comit is crossed in the moment of our sun system - he is only the second of his type.
Garching/Washington - Langes the researchers have just triggered it, but now they have awareness: one of the other stars crossed our sun system at the moment. He was baptized after his discovery 2I/Borisov and is just employed by world astronomies.
2I/Borisov: comet was discovered by amateur starms on the crim
The inflicted body was discovered by a amateur star named Gennadi Borissow on the crystal. He looked at a self-building telescope in heaven and other observations confirmed his first suspect. It is actually a unknown commit that does not stand out of our sun system. He is only the second of his type, which was seen at the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomists is now to get closely into an extraordinary sun system. It is obvious that the committee of our own systems, as reports the Astrophysical Institute of Canarys. The committee is clearly intersystemal from the International Astronomic Union (IAC) and is currently moved on a so-called hyperbel train that leads it from our system.
Comet was already seen before the flight - and can be observed several months
But before it is so far, the astronoms can watch him immediately. As in contrast to his operational, 2I/Borisov is already seen in his flight, which means that he can be investigated from the earth for many months. "The object will be reached by the midst of December and then to be seen with a medium-scale telescope," says Davide Farnocchi by the US Railway Author of Nasa. "They will only be watched by more than October 2020.
The new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Uumumua".
First knowledge of comet 2I/Borisov makes hopes in science
According to the first recognition, the commit is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers of diameter. At the same time the sky body seems to be similar to our compounds - as the IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the Swifster is similar to our. This observation is closely closely that commits can be formed in other solar systems by similar processes as in our, complemented de Leóns College Javier Licandro.
However, the observation is over individual knowledge, which has already been discovered two such objects within only two years, allowing a new way to investigate certain processes in other sun systems.
Asteroids re-employed are the researchers. Until recently, a rise asteroide passed to the earth, and they were dangerously near.

He also claimed that an atmosphere was being more likely in the attacks.
A few weeks ago, Boris Johnson was a young brother Jo his office as the Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory deputy. "I was destroyed in the past months between loyalty to family and national interest - it is an unsolvable shock," founded Johnson.
Johnson's language was also a huge critical in the church. As the "Times" reported, all 118 Bishops and Bishops of the Church of England criticize the language that the "the country is not suitable". In a common statement they explained: "In the last days, the language is both in the debates and outside of the Parliament, we should not have been acceptable. We should speak with respect to each other."

Influencerin wants Gratis Application: Life Forbidden at Cathay

Doping: Provide more Russian manipulations
The material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, the only Director of the World Entertainment Agency (Wada) and the current Head of integrity of the Lightthletic World Association.

In January 2019, the Moscouer Doping Lab finally delivered the requested samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Accounting Agency (Wada). Now he found that they were slaughtered.
In December 2014, a systematic fraud was enthusiasmed in the Russian sport. The Wada was cut by the Russian antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian sports were not primarily banned by the World Sports.

"We have determined numerous disks between the data that the Wada of a Whist Blogger, and those they received from the Russians."
The WM does not affect
This confirms the position of the IAAF: The Lightthletic Association remains the only organization in the Russian Bann. At the WM in Doha, 30 Russian sportors started under the neutral flag. They had to prove that they trained outside the Russian system and tested.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already been placed in the room and requested Russia to respond to the predominants within three weeks. Russia now threatens the renewed specimen of Russia and, in the worst case, also the exclusion of the Olympic Games 2020 in Tokyo.
