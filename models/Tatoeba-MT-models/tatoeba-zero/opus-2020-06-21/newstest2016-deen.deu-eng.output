Obama recommends Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreements and on the Teherans' destabilization measures in the Middle East.
However, it is also to go to the conflict with Palestinians and the debated two States resolution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been expanded for years.
Washington criticizes the sustainable Israeli settlement building, and Netanyahu offers lack of will at the peace process.
The arbitrary deal on the Iranian atomic programme has continued to deteriorate the relationship of the two.
In March, Netanyahu had held an overwhelming conversation on the invitation of the Republicans before the United States Congress, which was evaluated as a conflict against Obama.
The speech was not speaking with Obama, a meeting was rejected with reference to the election that was before Israel in his time.
In an emergency call, Professor wants to shoot his girlfriend.
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police a little sick voice that he shot his girlfriend and that the officers should come to his house.
The Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably surprising, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
In the outside of the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwriting note that was criticized on a white block: "I do so, I wanted to make it back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who loved me ever." This was underlined by the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by the Lamb.
There was no indication that the Lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already been 300 miles away to the schools, where he has shooted and killed the door to his office, according to the information of the police, Ethan Schmidt.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said that the Lamb had made the uncomfortable call once later.
Until the end of the day, there was another death: the Lamb took the life when the police checked him.
One day after the shoesere at the university, students and dozens were forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to make a picture of what the Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the State, as well as what students and employees knew him, helped them to draw a picture of a talented, but perhaps difficult teachers.
Students said they enjoyed his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Printis died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned the Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "belliable people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which includes 17 teachers, and many students visit two courses.
At the same time, there were some attitudes to deal with problematic behaviors.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who loving the Lamb, said, he was also a little nervous and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that the Lamb told him that he had to do stress at the end of the Academic Year 2014-15.
Lamb had before the Delta State University requested a license for healthy reasons and said that he had a health problem.
In this year he was teaching only two online curreses.
The new changes in the university's employment policy mean that the promotion that the Lamb had worked so hardly would not provide guarantees for an automatic way to a position as assistant Professional.
President William LaForge said, he didn't know anything about a conflict between the Lamb and Schmidt, but "though there was something in Mr Lamb's thinking."
These are questions that the Lamb can't answer.
After flying from the campus, the police later found Lambs Spur when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, the Lamb killed himself with a .38 calibre Pistole in the back of a house about a mile south of his parents' house at Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington Conunty Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car is still in the car.
It was not immediately clear why the Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she thought he knew the people living there.
The lamb rose in the area.
The Lamb started his work at the university, which has 3.500 students in a city with about 12.000 inhabitants and taught geographic and padagogic.
He was promoting in the spring in Pédagogik.
One of the long-year friends Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic and sweet.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and the lamb was 20 when she met with friends.
They and their friends were in the high school, and he was the sweet older man who tried to add you to the guitar game for a few years.
He was the woman's warm.
All the girls smile in there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson Chamber of Brandon.
The Lamb and Prentis, obviously, were some time together.
In the press call, the Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no origin of a heritage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the backstone house, which was limited to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Princess, Shawn O'Sten, said they had occurred 15 years ago, but friends remained and had a daughter now 19 years old.
"He was totally destroyed on the ground," said O'Sten about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Sten said he never met the Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that the Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail took both on a summer market three years ago.
Afterward, they played together with one or another gig.
O'Sten said his daughter writes and sing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weak bar near Gautier, said that he had finished the Lamb and Prentis Night in the night on September 5, last time after the Lamb had finished his guitar and mud harmonica game before a splendid public.
There was no signs that something wasn't true.
"After, only a happy couple," he said.
We were on the sleeves and we were shocked together.
I mean, they both had a good sense for kiss.
Schmidt, the whole professor, led the first seminar program and specialized himself on American origins and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professeur at the school.
He was married and had three children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his brotherhood and student committee.
On Thursday, the Delta State Campus in Cleveland took about 900 people, including dozens, employees, students and community members.
Schmidt Ms. Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the smooth watch while the university's "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The education will be reinscribed at midnight.
"We try to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis's over.
It's a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Petus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans attended this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that the Lamb called the emergency after he shot Schmidt, and that the Lamb in his emergency named Prentis as his wife, but there is no indication that the two were married once.

Michael J. Fox shocks about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premier of "Reck to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also noted for personal reasons.
"We are waiting at the theatre on the Royals, and I notice that the sit is empty to me, and it will be very clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a preceding documentary film "Back in Time".
The movie begins, and it comes to me that I'm a simulated ghost and a weapon length away from it, with the princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, and with the Governor Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Reck for the Future" had 30 years ago Premiere.

"Back in Time" will be viewed on VOD, DVD and selected cinema in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his answer to Russia's strengthened military support is: "No military solution" of almost five years of conflict, and more weapons will be worse for millions of people.
The United Nations Head reiterates all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to support together and integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on midnight he plans to meeting the Foreign Ministers of the five Permanent Member States of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France at the border of the General Assembly's Ministerial Meeting in this month - to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the displacements in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional forces "insolved this situation".
Ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they have demonstrated when reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Inquiry values shown that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a fleet.
Others have stopped him as a witz.
And some were waiting for a collapse.
But as some Republicans try to turn Donald Trump from the top rings on surveys, it has not worked (not yet).
Decades of the last 11 national investigations showed that Donald Trump conducted in the two-style area, and some start to ask seriously what it means for the name of the real estate-moguls.
Of course, it is too early in the election period.
No one said that Trump probably will win the Republican namement.
Experts stressed that Rick Perry's leadership was issued at this time in 2011, from which nobody won only one State in the appointment process.
And there are many reasons why he had been fighting in a general choice.
But foreign seat groups such as Jeb Bushs Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps maintenance and start to leave their dollars to shoot him.
There are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate module is not only a provisional phase:
Trumps' popularity values have turned around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in the middle of June, a survey of the Monmouth university showed that only two of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul.
By mid-July there were 40 percent.
At the beginning of August there were 52 percent.
Now six of the 10 Republicns have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About 3 of 10 say they have a negative view.
And these figures are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60% of the Republicans have a good view of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP elections GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week 67% of the Republicans said that they would be "behave" or "friendly" if the Trump would be named.
Only two of 10 say they'd be "enhanced" if he'd be the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates the same as the Trump (43 percent say they would be "happy" as. 40 percent, which say the same about the Trump).
The next in cases of encouraging?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other side, 47% of the Republican electors say that they would be "unfriend" or "enhanced" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the stability, the candidate.
A majority of the Republicans does not consider Trump's temperature as a problem.
While Donald Trump is very much criticized for its bombs and political words, 52% of the Irish electors who tend to the Republicans believe that the real estate Mogul has the right temperature for a president, so ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first state of the nation, the State of Iowa, where the 52 percent of the Republicns think that he has the personality for a super-command chair, says Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44% think that he has no personality to perform its office effectively, and almost six of 10 Independents say that his temperature is not going to the white house, so ABC/Post.
The Republican elections are able to deal with the idea.
When they set up their scientists, the Republican electors have to keep Trump for reality.
If they are asked, who first wins the GOP nomination, then, after a survey of CNN/ORC from the past week, four from ten to ten, that Trump is the best weight.
This is a change since four from 10 ends July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete revelation: GOP electors did not have the clearest crowd in the past.
At this time, in the last cycle, four of the ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the namement only 28 % for the final candidate in Middle Romney.
However, a variety of GOP elections has shown that the campaign of Trump Trumps is plastic.
Even if the Republicans gather to another candidate, the Trump is still almost everybody.
Some experts point out that the scattered field probably contributes to Trump's leadership while the anti-Trump support is distributed to more than twenty other candidates.
But a survey of Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-an-copf resource between the Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump supports the majority.
He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina, 13 points before Marco Rubio 14 points, 15 points before Walker, Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-an-copf rear with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who shoots him?
Ben Carson would take the employee with 19 points in a hypothetical head-an-copf cost.
A nice majority of Donald Trump fans says they have established their views.
A new survey of CBS/NYT shows that only a little more than half of the electors who support the trumpet is saying they have forgiven their voices.
Of course, it can happen much to change this, and no one can really say to never change the opinion.
46 percent said they would leave the door open to change to other candidates.
However, Trumps is the strongest competitive at the moment of the other foreign sisters, the Neuro surgery Ben Carson, but electors who say they have formed their views are twice for the Trump.
6 of 10 Republicns say that they agree with the Trump to the issue of immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his election-friend, two months ago, immigrants from Mexico "Manager" were called, immigration in the public discours in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bomb expression of the major Spanish Americans from the Republic of the United States will be dealt with and that the new orientation efforts are damaged.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six of 10 Republicns say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the ramp light, it seems to be done too.
The flexibility of the government is covered to new maximums.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, around half of the support of Republican electors, especially through their foreign seat status.
6 of 10 Republicns say in the new Monday Research of ABC/Post, they would like to be a foreign political sister than someone with government survey.
And they're too angry on Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa shows that three of four yowa Republicans are frustrated in the Congress with 54 percent "unfriendly" and 21 percent "successfully".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusively residents of Germany
Here, on the Hobookweg, the cheapest residence is located - with view of the North Seawatt.
In the street, a square meter of a reetdach house costs 73.300 euros.
"Auf Sylt is naturally limited the offer to objects," says in the study, so the high price.
A new study shows how a square meter is mostly costing.
Of course, 18.70 euros per squaremeter for a student bud in Munchen aren't really little.
On the contrary to Germany's top types, one of the prices comes as Peanuts.
The real estate service bar Angel & Völkers has published a ring list of the most exclusively German residential locations - with square metres prices in swimming heights.
There are several ten thousand euros nix - per squaremeter, well-known.
But well, who's able to spend it...
Overwhelming: Munich is quite not at the pitches.
Champions League: Bayern-level starts thanks to Müller and Devil
Two-face towers in Pireus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just a loop.
A happy part of Thomas Müller offered the FC Bayern the way to a winning 3:0 at Olympiakos Pireus - then please's.
The Champions League season is a sovereign capture.
The World Meeting Thomas Müller and Mario Detze have marked the FC Bayern in the Pireus' Hexenkesse of a dream start in the "Mission Mayland".
Trainer Pep Guardiola's shipping game in the Champions League at the Greek register of Olympiakos in warm atmosphere thanks to Mullers Doublepack (52./90.+2) and dense strikes (89.) with 3:0 (0:0).
The twenty-five Starter in Serie will be the first step to Finale on 28 May 2016 where Guardiola finally wants to take the heavy pool to Munchen.
Muller received the help of Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto in his 28th meeting in the Champions League to the Bayern leadership, who took a shooting of the world's master.
"We will not underestimate them," the Chief Philipp Lahm promised before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium before 3.6.88 soft fans - and took the words of the munchers.
They showed a concentrated and engaged idea without clarifying.
Pireus had winned his six recent home games in the king class, including against native clubs such as Manchester United, Atlantic Madrid or Juventus Turin.
2011 Borussia Dortmund was also shocked here (1:3).
However, Bayern, in seven Europecup doubles with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageous, but they were often unconscious of their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often introduced by game movement on the Links Outs Douglas Costa, which passed rarely against the previous brunisher Omar Elabdellaoui.
Muller had got more luck from right than his flank from the right half of the top left toreck.
In the 67th minute the world master was the possible 2:0.
The best chances in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos Stormer Ideye Brown sloped the Poland's headball from the line (26.).
Then by direct decline, the Torwart Roberto shared with the knie (35).
Although the battlers used to use dominant games, Pireus was able to set up the Nadelistics.
On Torhüter Manuel Newer was left.
Like he shocked a shooting of idea over the latte (56).
Before the new, Guardiola defended a fourth chain with David Alaba in the centre, next to Jerome Boateng, who did it well.
Mario godze, after muscular problems back in the frame, first stood out.
The WM-Held just gave green light after the final training, said Sports stand Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "What you want to do anything else, that's already bad."
In the first changing, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the Lewandowski (59).
Gotze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and 13 minutes later clearly made everything clear, put a molar on the other.
Before the game, it came to Krawall in the stadium.
After a smaller group of so-called Bayern fans in their Viewer block, apparently, the guests of guests Pireus had triggered with words and ghosts, the security forces took into and made up shocks against the munchers.
At least one Bayern fan was blessed from the stadium.
Who smokes has a higher risk to lose dens
Who smokes, it hurts not only the lungs, but also the dentists - that is near to a long-term study of Potsdamer.
The good news: In visibility the risk slows rapidly.
Sigarettes have a significant increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This comes from the long-term study of a international research team, including several employees of the German Food Institute (DIfE) in Potsdam.
In comparison with non-smokers, the risk was to lose their teeth prematurely, so that the 2.5-3.6 case was higher.
Scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes for dental distances were cards and distortions of the dent meat, emphasizes the difE.
For this parodontitis, be a risk factor, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and dent loss is therefore turned back to more frequencies dentists in smoking.
It is not clear that it also increases the risk for Karies.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take over ten years, until the risk of non-smokers back to the level, the student Thomas Dietrich declared by the English university Birmingham.
People should be convinced to become non-smoking, declared director Heiner Boeing from the DifE: "Tigarettes reduce the time of life".
Not to smoke is good for legs and fats and leads to a good dentist health up to age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the populations in the age of 65 to 74 years of dentness were affected, and the difE shared.
Previous investigations had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early dentists.
The new long-term study supports the funds.
Archaeologists stood on Kölner Rheinuffers on rest of the Spotish
For repeated times, archaeological funds have been made at the right rhino in Köln.
Near the building of the new Rhein Boulevard, Archaeologists of the Roman-Germanian museums have buried Skelet and rest of historical buildings on Tuesday, said museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the start of the construction work at the Rhein, the historics are searching for so-called landdenics.
In all building projects in the city district Köln, the Museum will always be accompanied as a fachamt for archaeological landscapes.
In the third part of the Rhein Boulevard, the archaeologists were now preached.
The text documents have already been known that in the fourth century, the establishment of a church and the eighth century has established a trier.
Besides the remains of the establishment and the Kirchurm, a Friedhof has also been discovered with about 350 guests that apparently belonged to the church.
Young woman of good affairs
After a young woman in the Bahnhof has been disappointed in Geilenkirchen lingers, the federal police requests the population to help.
On mid-day morning to 1.40 p.m., the woman came from the direction of the train station building to the end of the train slope, and was taken from a good department, which came from the direction of the Mönchengladbach.
It has led to the most serious violations of the Treasury Policei, according to the introduction of the train.
She was treated notably by place and was taken to a hospital.
As a result of the night-speaking of the young woman, the investigated officials do not have any knowledge.
The incident may have been observed by the Witnesses or the inhabitants have appointed accustical authorisations.
Inquiries are residents or passengers from Linderner Railways, sewing busways, Thomas Court Streets and Leipharther Street (L364).
Information given by the cause of the accident may be given by the Federal Police Hotline on the phone 0800/6888000 or any other police office around the hotline.
The EU Commission proposes a new Court on TTIP
The Commission has proposed a wide reform of the current scheme of Scheedsgericht systems to address the challenges planned by the Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement.
The restraint private lighting institutions for conflicts between concerts and States should then be dissolved by a transparent system that is clearly more traditional courts in its function.
"We want to establish a system that believes the citizens," the competent Commissioner of the EU Cecilia Malmström stated in the opinion.
The Swedish proposed to bring the proposal as a European negotiation position to free trade negotiations with the United States.
The German government announced support.
By TTIP, the largest free trade zone in the world will be covered with 800 million people.
The plans for reform of the current shipment procedures are concretely proposed that the EU and the United States select an independent judge for a new investment court.
They should be the same parts from the EU, the United States and third countries.
For the first time, it is also a second instance.
It would allow it to raise the right against judges.
Together, the proceedings agreed to the Schieds Directors, there was no possibility for their sentences.
In the debate of the last months, it has been clear that citizens did not believe fairness and justice in the old ISDS system, commented Malmstrom.
In the long term, she wants to work on a international investment right.
For example, the conflict between Chinese enterprises and EU States could be declared.
The main reason for the major resistance in Europe is to be a major basis for investor state switch procedures (ISDS).
Traditional ships are criticized by enemies as a type of parallel justice, enabled by the taxpayers to enable them to exempte national laws or to reduce consumer and environmental standards.
The first opinions called anti-TTIP organizations such as Campact are inadequate for the Commission's proposals.
In particular, it was criticized that they should not apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
However, the German Economic Secretariat Matthias Machig (SPD) called the plans as a great progress.
The Commission takes into account the key points of reform which the Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has developed in spring with other ministers of the EU.
The old system of private switches is from the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European Business Association for Business Europe warned to limit the economic opportunities by many new rules.
In particular, smaller and medium-sized enterprises could be aware of this.
When the discussions on the Free Trade Agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it remained clear on midnight.
The negotiations start from mid-2013.
However, the investment protection has not been discussed with the United States.
A framework for the Agreement should, as originally, be the end of this year.
This term applies to which it is not more tolerable.
Delikater Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on the kitchen in the Kölner Prime Club (days: Luxor).
In addition to him, a Flipchart is located on which the protected folks have registered the malarian state of Michigan with the Field.
The whole public, about 40 people, is closely taken by Steven's talk.
He tells on the hand of various places that he always marked on the map, which reports his minimum and zart ordered songs.
Where they have been, and how it looks like there, in his homemate.
If so, Stevens is a wonderful creative Irrer.
With the 2003 and the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" appears to be slightly composed songs that are very close to the American Folk of the Late Sixty, but every time they can slowly swim.
It decreased that "Michigan" would be the first part of a changing series: each of the 50 United States should be discussed as follows.
But since 2004 and in Rhein neighbors, "Seven Swans" has already appeared, and there are positive expectations.
Reduced Stevens comes here.
Live is enough to gitarre and Banjo.
A year later, the musician who lived in New York returned to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") 2005 appears to be a surrounded master work.
Overwhelming to ideas and stilist finish.
The album grows in the American Billboard Charts and lacks a yearly list of the influentious music media.
According to productive experiences, Stevens is then located on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth ordinary studioalbum is still wide orchestrated, however, by programed sequences or beats and plays with all effects and halls.
During the smaller clubs, the shoes shows here will be slightly spectacles from Neon-style countries and large fluorescent shoes deco.
Now Sufjan Stevens turns as part of a five-powered band by Germany.
More in the dark part of Hamburger!
Theater represents mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although now nearly 2000 guests have been able to sit in their store, Stevens turned back to the intimity and follow-up.
Without a word to the public, the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad album.
From the public it is heard: the debate is "opulent" and it is possible to remove the plate on the ground.
First to an appeal, Steven's decisively plays little older songs and finally sweets themselves under a real applause.
Jeremy Corbyns debut at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister
Since his choice, Mr Corbyns's debut is expected to be the questionnaire of the Prime Minister's appointment.
The new President of work Jeremy Corbyn will give his debtor to the questionnaire of the Prime Minister and set up with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will be able to put the first questions that he has given on midday, while his performance of the media is likely to be examined by the labour Members from the nearby.
He requested "ancient theatres and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could overcome some meetings to leave them colleagues.
The appeal will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it comes after his appointment to member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual session on TuC on TuC.
In the interim period, the decision of the President's workshop, which has to be held on Tuesday during the day of the day of the National Symnes at the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in Stille, has caused a criticism of a number of tory MPs and is at the center of several titles in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national sympathy has given its attention.
A speaker of Mr Corbyn said he had been "in respectful style" and he recognized the "Royal Air Force in the air battle for England".
But a member of the Corbyns shadow cast, Owen Smith, reported in the BBC two Newsnight program, he was working to sing the national symnees, "independent" of his faith that Monarchie should be created.
Soon a twenty-first ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's Spitzen Office, calling for differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than one sixth parliamentary party was originally supporting him as leaders.
The Political Correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also in the labour, according to Mr Corbyns' statements on the position to the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn said the TUC Conference proposed changes to remove all the idea of restriction.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith said the Deputy and Renten Minister that the party is "very clear" that they are only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26,000 £ to 23,000 £.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth working chairman, David Cameron, since he is the Tory Chief, in the last decade of the Parliament's dispatch box.
The President-in-Office, who promised another approach to policy, says that he had "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP said that the questionnaire of the Prime Minister is to be comparable, and that it will be left by both "slaughterness" and the distortion with rebellion and, instead, has focused on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of the Economic Minister, will be represented by him if he does not participate, for example, if Mr Cameron is in the foreign.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues are taking the word, and he spoke to John Bercow, the speaker of the sub-home, to discuss the problem.
When he was leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to remove the policy in the style of a "casperle-theaters" which is often linked to the questionnaire of the Prime Minister, but a few years later he felt that he had failed.
As it was first sent to television in 1990, the questionnaire was considered to be the principal barometer of the judge of a leader and its leadership in the subcommittee and its position under its parliamentary colleagues, although critics argued that they became a carrière and needed broad reforms.
'Shooting in Joburg': Trained for Obdachless Youth in Photographs

"I was shooted in Joburg" (I was held in Joburg) is a common study that taught young people in it how they take photos from their environment and gains.
BBC News has taken one of the first ends of the project.

Pfund increases by speeding payment growth in the United Kingdom
The pound increased by data showing an increase in the wage of the United Kingdom. Parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the commandive target SABMller.
between May and July, the result of Boni in the United Kingdom was 2,9% compared to the same previous period.
This percentage was estimated since 2009 on the time of increase in interest.
The pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar at $1.5505 and was up to 0.84 % compared to the euro to 1.3730 €.
The FTSE 100 index concluded by an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMller was the extraordinary share on the market and made a 20% spent after the transfer of the Rivalen AB Inbev offer.
A transaction would combine the two largest routines in the world and bring marks like buds, stela Artois, Aberni and Grolsch.
Burberry actions were higher than 0.9% after encouraged news from the competition concerns for the Luxus-government Richemont.
Richemont's recent sales numbers spend all expectations and showed that the transfer in China - a key market for Burberry - re-established growth.
Attracts from Glencore increased by 5% after the mountainbaue said he took $2.5 billion by a sale of assets as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packing and paper center Mond were the largest losses on the index, with a decline of 4.3%, after the Goldman Sachs had set its evaluation for the company rating on "very".
JD sports increased around 3,1 % after the sporting enterprises reported a preimbursement of 46.6 million per year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher loss is threatening the expansion.
The director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum loan for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the loads of potential customers".
But it's unbelievable that this purchase power will be equipped with the higher job costs in his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD sports, added, and that could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital city: on Beeber-Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lippie 21-year-old youth, a handling with upper fresh fresh.
The guy with the platinblound hair is 100 million euros hard.
Before even more.
Mr. Beeber is now in Berlin.
And the generation U17 turns back.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old boy has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
Don't worry.
Hundreds of fans joined Justin yesterday.
In addition, Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
However, since 7 a.m., the polyn is located on the cold stone plates Berliner Luxus Hotel on the Potsdamer place.
The Beeber-Bau: Here you live in Idol, whose poster is on top in Stettin, since Monday.
The suite, in which the Canadian songs live, costs exactly the day as their mother Ewa in half year.
That's all right.
He says: "In the first time my victory should be sit in the tenth class in Gymnasium."
"I'm gonna fill her a dream."
School obligation?
Who's juckt?
Not the fans.
Neither beeber isn't.
He's shooting out anywhere.
For the advertising in the Superbowl's newspaper, he covered three million, a two-year deal with a anti-pickel company, a lot of dollars on the Beeber account.
And with each puppe that looks like he and over the ladder also casts birds.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're wonderful at the window box.
More than 100 million should have been so able to be found.
Some say the Hype went too far.
Others point out, Beeber is finally just in the United States and the United Kingdom with its new simple "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Beeber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, does not first interest many none.
At least he does that.
Pegida-Plakat brings Libanese to cardffeldern and ideas
Cartballs or dinners?
It's both - even in the cartofloor that the Old-Burg of Imbis has developed Hani Alhay.
Inspirited by the speech "Cartoffel instead of Döner" on a place of the Pegida movement, Alhay kartoffel and meat are shocked together on a snake.
On the idea, he brought a place at a Pegida demonstration with the "Cartoffn instead of Döner," which he had seen in the television.
Since then, in his shop, a grill piece is equipped with meat and cards.
"This is Multiculti for the Magen," Alhay says.
The idea of Libanon has now been put into Munchen at the patent office.
There, according to the information provided by the Authority, it is already protected as a pattern of use.
How many fleshs and how many cards of the skin are, Alhay does not want to be tragic.
Just so much, "It's still better together," he finds.
In his customers, the Kulinary People's understanding is also good.
Metcash starts landwork campaign for combating Aldi accidents
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches before a aldi-audience march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food-Groen Metcash has started a land-function campaign to defend the market share of IGA individuals in South Australia and Western Australia for a $7,7 million.
During Aldi, the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 lods in South Australia and Western Australia prepared the next year, enhancing Metcash and IGA supermarkets their relationships with local food providers and build IGA brands by mainstream marketing and marketing on social media, as well as events as Adelaide show.
IGA shoppingers and suppliers spend on board, with brands like iron manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA rooms and sales the licensed tickets for the South Australian football liga to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will be published further details of its defence strategy on September 29 when the large leaders run its annual investment strategy day.
It is much on the game, since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30% of Metcashs IGA loads and generate higher winning margins than Metcashs IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoricly provincial and IGA units have a more strong market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the Western States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take about five per cent of the food market in these two countries, and all existing operators, but mainly self-employed individuals will be deleted.
A report published in this week estimated Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath that the IGA individuals could lose $360 million per year and Metcash $2,2 million to the end of 2016.
This prognosis is based on the acceptance that Aldi opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will be achieved by $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and food business and the amounts of Metcashs high fixed costs could be around 13 million $ winning before interests and tax costs, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time Metcash lost market share in the Eastern States, mainly at Aldi and Coles, although a recent investigation of Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley acknowledges that Metcash's cost of food and food business is 3.8 per cent in 2016, with 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 and the market share of 14 per cent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.3 per cent to 2020.
Last week, the leading Fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, reported that Metcash was probably in a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Douglass.
But it will be said that a member of Metcash has contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has been reduced by 18 per cent to 14 per cent, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, providing approximately 1.200 IGA individuals, was 43 per cent, which reflects the operational debt debt reduction in the same pressure on relocation and margins.
However, the big-speaker is growing and investing more than 150 million dollars to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products every week and to improve the IGA individuals in improvement of their loads by making more fast growing fresh food and provide a better selection of private label life.
Metcash's principal business leader Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and loading programs will be introduced to Elan and hopes that the biggest will return back to a maximum growth in 2017 for the first four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis has more loving than critical for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "coalitional damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and wins in view of the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy most lovingly as a criticism for his own behavior.
Cokkinakis, who is young of the talented Duos, which is always called "special Ks", is through the fascinated interference of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters Masters on the light.
In a fair qualification game in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his partner Ryan Harrison had to be separated two times by the swimming leader, and Harrison said: "Wawrinka had to shoot Kyrgios, and I should shoot the child."
While the last time he was seen as he destroyed a tennis shock, after a shooting a potential US open seat of Richard Gasquet, he was strongly defended by Healy.
The adolescent is now in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth on the second place in Bernard tomic in Davids-Cup-Halbfinal against Britain.
"Any thing I'm very excited is the fact that, according to my view, Thanasi was taken a little into the war," said Healy.
He destroyed a shooter when he lost a shooting in the United States, but he's not the first player who destroyed a shooter of fleet with himself, and I know that Thanasi is good enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, in fact, he has been very good in the United States opening, even under the very provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he's giving a lot of recognition.
He has a nice team on himself, he has a great family about himself, and I think he's being treated too strict.
He's a very thrilling 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he's walking in the team and so further, he has never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the environment, he trains hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and excited young man, and I think he's worth to be judged after his own services.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios's important decision to begin on Friday, and he describes the "general decision" as the right for all, but safeguards the man from Canberra to return to a long-term solid part in the team."
"If we want that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not on all the contraverse around [Kyrgios]," he said Healy.
And I believe that Nick has made the upset so fast asking people like Federer and Murray. He grows in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and wins all the critics he has done, but we try to support him, we try to make him understanding the consequences of his acts. Sometimes outside the light he can think about it, I think it's best for the manner and it's the best for him.
European Refugee Crisis: Hungary explains the state, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and resigned the southern borders with Serbia on Tuesday and observed all who tried to come illegally to the country. All with the aim of stopping the throne of migrants.
Cao followed the border, as hundreds of migrants gathered together in a country of nowhere, and Serbian officials reacted with rebuilding.
Those who were fled before violence were set up for an unknown time in a agriculture stretch on the street between the two control points of the country and built the halls and left there.
But frustations were shocked.
When a police shocked over them, the migrants scanned "Open the borders!" and shouted crying against the Hungarian Preparation Police.
Some foods from protein and water return.
Serbia's Foreign Minister explained that it was "inacceptable" that migrants would be returned from Hungary while coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbian) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
In the next days, there must be a conversation with Brussels and other countries", said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulences at the Hungary-Serbia borders came one day after the 28-nation block at a strict meeting in Brussels could not agree with the common immigration policy.
However, the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were looking for refugees in the overwhelming Italy and Greece and expressed their hope that the next month or the end of the year would achieve an agreement that the EU States would take more than 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
On Thursday, the Federal Officer Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special office of the European Union to address the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not put his hope to a rapid action of Brussels or its neighbors.
The emergency in two southern regions in Tuesday has made the authorities more power to control the crisis, so that they could delay roads and accelerate the asylum procedure.
The Hungary Foreign Minister Peter Ssijarto said that his country was also the construction of a steel rail along his borders to Romania to stop the throne of migrants through the country - after it ended a shock on the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent, Charlie D'Agata, reported that even prison sequences were used to create the steel race between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past months, Hungary has become a significant engagement and the starting point in the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and other parts in the Middle East.
However, President Victor Orban has found that most economic refugees are income, which are looking for a better life, and not war refugees, who have the right to protection - a view that is strong in the opposition to other EU States, including Germany.
The new laws in force for midnight in Hungary make the overriding of the borders or the damage of the 4-metre (13 feet) high penalty that the Government has built through the southern border to Serbia is a crime. These laws also set higher punishment for condamned persons.
"On the basis of the situation of the mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the emergence of the emergence", said the government speaker Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern city of Szege.
We say it very clear: illegal border transition is a crime.
The Parliament must still agree to the use of the military, which will be expected for the next week, but reporters of Associated Press have seen hard armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs a long time on the border.
Gyorgy Bacondi, Landes Security Adviser for Orban, said that 45 people were in the attempt to find out the borders, and 15 other were already deeply entered into the country.
They come out by harming the punishment, they are now in the police and are accused of criminals in accordance with the new laws.
The authorities are in order to quickly repair the punishment.
The Hungarian officials also concluded two of the seven border transmissions with Serbia after a steelwagon with a steel route to close the borders.
Chaos crossed the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container, to edit the data of people and press a majority of people to join there.
At about 20 years, thousands left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important car rental connection of Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they could return to Hungary.
Select-2016: Hillary Clintons pre-spot before Bernie Sanders in national investigation
The former United States Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to have a two-third predict in the democratic residents for the namement at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her against the ground.
Clinton has now supported 47% of democratic electors at the forecast (58% before), while the sanders are on the second place, 27% (augmented by 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not announced whether he is candidated to the President, is supported by 15% of the democratic electors.
More than five months before the beginning of the predicts, most democratic electioners say that it is too early to say that their view is fixed to which candidates are supported.
But Clinton's supporters are more responsible than the other candidates in their choice.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton lost a number of demographic groups while Sanders achieved some wins.
Clinton holds a great pretension for women and gentlemen, but these predictions have reduced.
Their support for the men is clearly cut, and the sanders are back here only with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage in democratic elections under 50 years has been fleet, and they and sanders are now at the same height.
However, Clinton has a larger precaution for the elderly electors.
Last month, Clinton had two-site prepayment in the Liberals, but Sanders now have a 5-ponct prepayment at this group.
Another half of the democratic electors of the pre-selections are saying that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were appointed by the party.
A fourth would support her with some preserves and 15% more would support them only because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Maybe it's not surprised that Clinton's current supporters are particularly shocked by her.
The views are stronger mixed with those who do not support Clinton today - only a fourth would encourage it.
While 48 percent of the democratic elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican electors say this about their piccent candidate Donald Trump (35%).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want to be the candidate, the most common response that she has the right experience (16%) follows that it is time to be a President (13%) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10%).
Clinton's supporters are also mentioned with Bill Clinton (9%).
Adoption to address problems and selectivity is also discussed.
Since the Vice-President moves a potential for the Chairman's office in the Waagschool, 57% of the democratic electors want to see him in the rain - although a third believes that he should not do it.
If democratic elections are asked, who would be their second choice for the party, it is a skin on the sight.
More than half of Clinton's adherents say that the skins would be their second choice far before Sanders.
If you decide to candidate the name of the democratics, Hillary Clinton's pretension is increased before sanders, of 20 points with skins on 30 points without swimming.
Fifty-five per cent of the democratic electors see Clinton as candidate with the best chances to win the choice; but this number of 78 per cent in the last month.
The skin is a second at this measure, but the percentage that looks like it is the "selectional" is increased.
However, the question of what is more important for a candidate is called democratic choice questions.
Like in the last month, the only democratic candidate or potential candidate is not an inacceptable table for this election candidate.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features in the choice of their party.
Most of them consider Clinton, sanders and skins as honest and trustful and with strong leadership qualitys.
The skin is the best of the three candidates in honor, while Clinton's strength is the leading force.
Three percent of democratic electors do not believe that Clinton is honest and reliable, so many say about Sanders (15%) but 27 percent have no view of it.
Democratic elections generally see also Clinton, Sanders and Birds ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, some four of the democratic electors have no view of sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are continued to be held as a Foreign Minister during the office, most democratic electors are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not in general influenced their views.
But it's a different story in the United States public.
The half of the Americans are now unpleasant with their statement, while only a third is satisfied.
The public view to this was divided in March, short after the problem was shut down.
The majority of the Americans said that the e-mail control did not have an impact on their general views of Clinton, although 36 per cent said that their opinion was still defeated.
There are mainly Republicans, more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustful by the electors of their party, this remains a problem for them understood: only 32% they are earnest and reliable, eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less than since May.
62% of the election authors do not consider a honest and reliable person.
At the same time, 55% of the election authorized countries also see Trump as not honest and not trustful.
However, Clinton and Trump receive good notes to lead.
From the six guests tested, the skin, the carson and the bush best depend on honestity.
A majority looks more honest than Sanders but many have no view of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic electors in the pre-selection is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson turns to a countrywide survey close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson is located on the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close to Donald Trump
The two candidates are now half of the support of the electioners in the new survey, and others are dramatically losing stop.
The Republican electioners continue to support a large number of trumpets in the country. The support increases from 23 % in the last CBS survey, which was held before Fox News in the last month, to 27 % in the service day's survey.
But Carson fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period.
The survey also acknowledged that Carson was well accepted in demographic groups and that the Trump was subject to higher education in the Republicans.
The rest of the field, with exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio-governeur John Kasich, is shocked with Wisconsins Gouverneur Scott Walker, who has been the most deepest deeply, even from 10 % of support in the last month to 2 %.
The former Florida Governeur Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, is 6% on the third place.
The error margin in the sample of 376 persons from the Republican elections in this recent investigation is Plus or Minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson increases in the surveys - he supports 19% in the Republicans, after the Trump with 32% support.
The recent survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed clearly the Trump before Carson.
With regard to one of the past weeks Carson, Trump found a few sideholders for the former neurochirurgy, even after Carson apologised to question the Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaneous in Iowa.
Angular bath temperatures: The East Mediterranean is up to 29 °C.
Even if the skin values are measured only in the television, it is already a trip on the Mediterranean to present a warm water.
A bathroom in the North or East Sea should be a shorter enjoyment at maximum 17 degrees.
Some do not go to the sea: Maximimal 18 degrees have the water in the North and East Sea in this week, shares the German Water Service (DWD).
Bade temperatures still offer the Mediterranean: in the East it is even up to 29 degrees.
In Adria, it is 25 degrees in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes on 28 degrees.
Five members of the brotherhood with the death of a Balch College Neuling
Two years later, after a student died during a sketchy ritual of a student's connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, the murders were sent against five persons.
Chun "Michael" Deng, members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi University, took a brutal attack during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed its transport to the hospital, which has participated in his death, shared the police.
The officers said he was shocked with a 30-pound skin skin, and was repeatedly attacked while he tried to get a goal over a floored field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about head pain, and then he was unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi branch did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng was deniable and waited for a hour before they brought him to a hospital, so the police.
However, they had the time to change their clothes, google their symptoms and contact the national presidents of the brotherhood to get the Council, said the police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point the members began to hide Utensilies and put the well-being of the brotherhood on the basis of Michael Deng," said the police chief Wagner.
He couldn't be recovered, and the next morning he died.
After an autopsie report, Deng was repeated with stroke power injuries to head, smell and upper skin.
"The many families have been destroyed by the skins of the brotherhood. At least one student dies from the Skandals every year from 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a law lawyer who joins Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherships and their members must be taken into account, and this step of the authorities is very important.
A Continent Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a complaint for murdering three degrees for the first five members.
Twenty-third members of the brotherhood, including Mr Mei, are also accused of a criminal association.
"We do not only want to be responsible for those involved, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned it officially or in officially, so we will also take them into account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baltic College has prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has reacted to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases the interests
An increase in the interest rate, and the houses will be divided into channels, increased payment rates, and the economy will be led to a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will stop.
In particular, the history of the economy only provides low guidelines to the end.
A recession occurred within 11 months after the first increase in interest rate and 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve is often, even though not always, of a factor in how the economy and the financial institutions react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not concentrate on when they start to increase the interest rates, but much more on the period required for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end, however, market operators may find that the total restraints may have been transferred because of an increase in interest.
"The first increase in the feed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted immediately by some as a signal for the end of the "balanced money" period," said Julian Jessop, Chief of Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
On the contrary, we are not expecting the continuing return of US interests to normal heights, but still at too low levels to lead to the sixth shock that seems to be afraid.
This does not mean that there will be no effects.
Here is one of the historical trends that are based on how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen in the last month, the advancement of interest increases can make for a while volatile.
When increased, the impact is not so dramatic.
"A tendency seems to be decreased that ownerships are 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in the monetary policy", said German bank analysts in a new study on what happens after interest increased feed.
Indeed, in the past 35 years, the market has been mostly in the slope - about 14 percent - in the way to increase interests, was very difficult in the 250 days later (mean wins of 2.6 per cent), then back to a normal state of 500 days, with a average retail rate in the past six cycles of 14.4 per cent, according to a current analysis, the Bob Doll, Chief installation strategies at Nuveen Asset Management, published at Barron's.
The German Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to be decreased in the increase cycle and that the pensions are starting to reduce.
Recesions are a fact of the economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that have not been before and could accelerate a recession.
It is also noted that the gross domestic product will be close to its lower point at an increase in the interest rate of the feed.
According to the German Bank, 118 interest increases since 1950 only two times the nominal BIP was at 4,5%.
Although the second quarter 2015 was at 3,6%, only few expected that this will be delayed and expected for the third quarter according to the information of Atlanta Fed only 1,5%.
Increased interest rates in such a questioning economic art may be risking and the question "If it is different this time," said the German Bank.
The market sharers have taken the whole year to increase the feed, and all the eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that the FOMC can accept an increase in this meeting, the Futures Gandle only increases the probability of 25%.
"In our study, all the increases cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increased growth in the PIB and higher prerecensions are very fast after the start of recovery", says the report.
On the contrary, this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cyclus is the longest expected of the feed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is up to 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, since the market has increased interests, and the pattern is very similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect of loans is faster than if actions change their strategic course.
In cash, the indicators seem to change the direction when the first increase/thising in the cycle is followed.
At the end of the increase cycle, the transferers immediately fall, said the German Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that the increase in the interest rates will lead to a closer gap between longer and shorter costs and to a decline of the curve.
High-speaking benefits often bring better in such a climate, although "we are still carefully expected to expect higher revenue", said Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income Analystine in Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations there are some signs that the market has adapted to a more rigorous monetary policy", he wrote.
The short-term interests have increased, the fund curve is slightly, the credit levels have expanded and the volatility has grown - all features of the market when the Fed increases its strategy.
In the whole, enterprises that develop the largest part of their business in the United States will benefit from increased interest rates and local products are more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse, as an increased dollar makes their products on the global market and also the financing of their debts.
"The story shows that "qualitys-" actions tend to react three months after an initial interest increase exceedingly", said the Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for customers.
Enterprises with strong balance have over 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital rates as well as low volatility in their shares also transferred their pensions with low quality to average 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percent points).
Debts will be a great problem.
Enterprises with a high share of flexible interests are mostly lost, said Goldman.
Out of the clean share games, consumers will also benefit by the increased dollar.
Sparer could see profits by higher income, even though experts are different, how fast it will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the classic FM, says parliamentary member Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the sender because of its "conclusion"
He argued that it is not to differ increasingly from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she tried only The Brits.
Parliament's College Damien Collins adopted the sentence The Voce and said that this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "switch" to classic FM, with a leading parliamentary member and increases a new pressure on the sender to prove that he does something that the privates do not do.
The Conservative Deputy Andrew Bingham also said the BBC's boss that the public and legal radiostor "verdume" is not more different from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "smile" - but it seems to change classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started in the last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started in the past year, seems to be only under another name.
So, if you're trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples in which you actually just pull out what is already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
BBC General Director returned and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far before its commercial competitors when it goes to Live music and public declaration.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will learn about classic music anywhere different.
And there is a commitment to Live music and music, which is really unconfronted.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to give new works as a task, I really think very important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it should be working hard to join the public as it did in the past because the Britishs are less informed about classic music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC production, which took place during the hearing of the Committee on the Selection of Cultural, Media and Sports, under fire to spend the commercial rivals on the feet.
The Tory Deputy Damien Collins applies to The Voice - the musical talent show of BBC, which was purchased by the Netherlands producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marking?
Lord Hall found that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "in particular BBC wine".
He added that he wanted that the company "is a heat out of our hair steel" when it started a serial of entrepreneurship next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of additional series of The Voice in the future or give money to the payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet environments were the latest and the Black Friday may be responsible for this in August
In the first three months of 2015, seven percentage increase in online sales was increased.
In the last month, the lower result has been since the start of records in 2000.
Online sales increased the use of phones for buying three years ago
Experts believe that the Black Friday has broken the expenditure in November
For over a decade the virtual purchase has grown, and many of the main purchasing streets of the United Kingdom have become spiritual cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that the online environments are stamping after new numbers only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with only five percentage increases in the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stating, after new numbers only seven percentage growth in the first three months 2015
"If you consider the growth rates for the previous years and return to 2000, it has always developed in the course of the time", said Andy Mulcahy, the exporter of the IMRG sale index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales were increased three years ago as buyers to work with their phone purchase.
It means that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now it is, and we may experience that growth is reduced.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for the following circles.
Experts believe that the purchasers are retaining their purchases before this event, which happens on Friday last November.
Over the last year, the average number of buyers was five times cut off to their computer to make their fingers, and some handler web sites cut off.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyers were fighting for shoots, could stop buyers to make buyers.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that from 5 £ expenditure was issued more than 1 £ online.
In some products such as television and wash machines, more than one third of the buyers are now performed via web shops.
At the same time, more than one fourth of the people's clothes and shoes online instead of the modekets in the interior cities.

Other losses receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of the accepted Eastern Europe Manufacturers is over
British employees growing handworkers, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified handlers from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 additional screwfix channels on handlers
At the same time King Fisher 60 B & Q sales plants will be closed to the country
Of Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is noted that British households and pines are undergoing for the use of qualified Eastern Europe workers who carry out the work in their homes
If you can be sent with a hammer or a pink to strike walls, you are apparently a minority today.
In fact, British employees are increasingly employed to carry out home workers in their homes, so the chief of the company behind B and Q.
Véronique Laury, new leader of Kingfisher, who has the tree market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified handlers from Eastern Europe, has been obtained by services to deep prices.
This is why Kingfisher plant to open 200 more screwfix Shops, which are set up to handworkers and to close 60 sales facilities from B&Q.
Mrs Laury said she wants to work more women in B & Q-Shops, as eight of ten purchase decisions are taken by women.
The men are now overwhelming with the employees.
She said it should be necessary to set up the growing demographic trends that show more women's single budgets that are more renewed than in the past.
Ms. Laury said, "There is still a majority of men in our branches.
We have to move this to a more balance.
In fact, half of our customers from women with 80% of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of the only five women in the rank of a British Index in the FTSE100, has also established its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has put 50% of the team with women, including its business management and financial arrangements.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - a variety of things here is an important issue.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher indicated a decline at half-year winning and the arrangements after the group slowed the costs for the closure of the loads.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, the screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Aich/Dob officials for infidelity before court
Aich/Dob must be responsible for infidelity and expenditure interference on the country.
The complaints were not guilty.
One of them was also accused of official abuse.
It has been free from this prosecution in May.
The current process was reversed.
Under the investigation, Ober State lawyer Robert Riffel had been criticized that the complaints were used for private purposes in the years 2006-2011 of the Counsel accounts.
The damage is covered by about 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also accused of financial acts.
This fact was the President of the Creator Senator, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later time.
The defence for the conspiration of the infidelity indicated that the Agreement had not yet been a share of a possession.
The sporting officials would only have calculated injuries and the sport club, for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011, and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, had been debt - the passive was about 600,000 slilings in 2001 (south 44.000 euros).
"And we were in front of the situation: let's go to the club or shoot the club?", said one of the accused, in the Brother Office of the Financial Office.
With his colleagues and complaints, he then decided to take this task.
With all the risks.
"We shooted money to add our life assurances as security to the bank," he said at the invasion.
It should be agreed with the Agreement: you can manage the money freely, it can only be made a debt.
Furthermore, in the corresponding financial success, the payment of income damages is reciprocal until 1991.
Therefore, a part of the injuries has been paid since 2003, as one more on the account.
The former Obmann also explained the procedures.
The accounts and books managed together the two complaints, said the second accused.
Why the payments of the Agreement were not opened detailedly, the judge asked.
The agreement has not been interested in the details of the financing, if only the debt freedom was important, so the answer.
When a official investigation was started in 2011, a amount of EUR 120,000 was overlooked to the Agreement.
This was the retreat, the accused declared.
This value paper account went on the name of the second complaint and was not known according to the Agreement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The questionnaire did not know for a long time.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the United Nations.
If something happened to him, no one would know about this money, the lawyer put the State lawyer in the room.
The Mitange complaint has been informed, the official was justified.
This reference was formulated as "Shadenwise-Government".
Why would the judges and the lawyers want to know?
This declared the first complainant that he had not agreed with this formulation because the Agreement had never been harmed.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "It's all you're out of the snow."
"If I have a law advisor?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said he never had a hundred content, he just calculated kilometers and denses.
He has taken into account the Agreement 1.000 euros per month, but the real involvement was much higher, he added.
The lawyers could not submit exact documents for the previous years.
These were not maintained after a operational test, where everything was correctly estimated, and they were declared.
The second accused was also a kilometer payment.
All advertisements were carried in bar, and he had to walk from his place to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main negotiation is continued on 23 September with the investigation of Witnesses.
Hewlett packard stretchs 30,000 jobs
Furthermore, for three years, the computer rise will reduce further jobs when the company is deployed.
Scientific exhibitions at US computers Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not find an end.
The United States Technology Centres, within its restructuring, plant the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its company party.
The company shared the costs of $2,7 billion (2,4 billion) on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special charge of around 2,7 billion dollars that will be attacked from the fourth quarter.
The 55,000 jobs driving down three years is not yet closed.
HP was still employed at the end of the year 2013/14 around 302.000 employees.
Afterwards the hewlett package was 2,3 percent.
The large-scale concerts from the California Palo Alto are at the time: so the computer and printer business will still be gathered into a new society, separated from the most recent areas with computer servers and data records for companies and other services.
The two business lines should be notified at the Börse.
A re-interested PC compartment, as well as a weaker demand of enterprises according to its services, recently led to Lenovo to the world of the second largest PC manufacturers.
In the third business center at the end of July, the paragraph of PC and printers returned to 11,5%.
The expense was about 8% at about 25.4 billion dollars.
The resolve was returned in 15 of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a switch and massive switch on the change in the industry.
The 76 years of age under the leadership of Meg Whitman has reacted late on that customers enhance Smartphones and tablets instead of buying ordinary computers and performing more online business.
Whitman's restructuring plans are totally designed to reduce about 55,000 places.

Röszke: Abuse of Violence to Serbian-Unarian borders
The Hungarian police has set up on the Serbian border at Roszke's Tennessegas and watercrafts against hundreds of refugees.
Euronews Correspondent, Daniel Bozsik, has engaged in violence on the border control point.
He reported phone:
A group of refugees crossed the borders.
In the meantime, a police line was formed, and the police was prepared for a watercraft.
40 to 50 refugees began to shoot with stones, shoots and plastic fleets after the officers.
The officers first introduced uninterrupted pfefferspray.
Then the police used the T-R-G.
Many of the heat gas was spent in direction of the refugees.
That's how the group was dissolved.
Refugees have now retreated something unexpectedly.
A pregnant and apparently blessed woman was taken out of the zone.
Kids who shouted the skin gas cry.
Other refugees settled together and suffered under a breath.
The slaughterers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of skin gas and pfefferspray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Note Bank
The world observes if the US notes bank comes together on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to take the important decision, whether for the first time for almost one decade the interests will be raised or not.
A survey of 80 economists asked by Reuters found that a little more than half of the view was that the Fed will do this now think that the feed will be reducing some longer and the interest rates at the current position of 0 - 0.25%.
It is a historical event, because it has been seven years since the Fed quotes have been placed on NULL.
"On the first time we draw close to a situation where a large central bank may leave the Null and starts a process of normalization of the interest rates," said Angel Ubide, leading workers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The United States is at a relatively good performance stage, an adjustment of thousands of dollars are added to balance and generate only a low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rare view of global situations.
It warned the markets to increase, but the signs pointed out that the opportunities against such a step are good.
The decision shall be published at 20.00 p.m. on Thursday
Death protection at the Delta State University left an apology
After the shooting and murder of his friends in Mississippi on Monday morning, and later on the day of his colleagues, Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it "leads to do" at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it unexpected", the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that the Lamb, Dozent for Geography and Social Science Education at the Delta State University, led the call number against 10:00 on Monday
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb said to the employee of the emergency centre that the police should send the police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also said that it's a "sweet dog" in the house, but "no one will ruin," but it's probably being shocked.
The police asked the appeal on his name, but he didn't give him.
The Lamb didn't explain for his shoot.
When the police had the scenes, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a manual note of the Lamb, 45 who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to turn it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman that ever loved me."
After the record of the notes, the Lamb took 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor for history, before he finally took his own life on Monday night, as the police turned to him.
President William LaForge said, he didn't know anything about a conflict between the Lamb and Schmidt, but "though there was something in Mr Lamb's thinking."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb believed that Prentis had a relationship with Schmidt, the authorities said on Thursday, it was "no information, no evidence" for a "trieck relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Sten, who said they were married for about seven years, as a "good man".
The two of them happened 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Sten said he and Prentis had a daughter that is 19, and she was "destructed on the ground".
He said that Princess was her daughter "anyone's best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home to home, following Linsday Knowles identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentis, who had a dog named Lightning, met with the Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help others," said Knowles
The police said that the Lamb had called friends at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "It's not going to prison."
When the police took him on the highway 1 near Greenville later in this night, the Lamb passed his car on the side, fly up, flew into the forest and killed himself with a shooting.
Lamb received a doctor title from the Delta State University in spring 2015, as its life switch is on the site of the university.

Eurowings: Airhansa builds the concerts
The air Hansa planted a great concentration.
A half billion euros in the year want to escape the airhansa concentration alone with a better organization.
150 of the world's over 1000 leadership forces will cost the workplace.
There are new negotiations with the pilot work.
The airhansa builds its enterprises structure and values the eurowings.
The objective of re-orientation is a result amount of approximately 500 million euro per year from cost- and resolving synergies, which shared the aircraft at midnight.
Among other things, there is no scope for passengers at the future.
The Eurowings Eurowings flee to be developed as far as possible.
In the main position of head Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings.
Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with the future of the concerts against Ryanair and Easyject.
The organization of the 120 000 employees had been strongly complex.
The airlines were signed under the tent of the Passage Airline Group, which constitutes three fourth of the annual sum of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC) the negotiations shall be re-appealed after the legally suspended strike on Thursday.
This shared the work.
The topic of the discussion should be the scheme of relaxation for pilots.
Cockpit wants to get "in a year with a pregnosted record result" soon as possible results.
The conflict between workshops and airlines led to different strikes in the past months.
The sparconcept "Wings" is close to the transitional supply of pilots.
It seems that the airhansa in the fight against competitors is covered by Eurowings.
Under the title "Morgenting in the south", Leena Kruger's gardens are to be seen in the arts-based house.
The long-year-old finnin in gods has set a selection of untitled works for the white room of the house, which encourage their viewers to give thanks to travel.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United cannot play for a month because of double fraction
Luke Shaw has a double fraction of his right skin at the PSV at the Champions League League site of Manchester.
While this brought the left foreign defender to wine and will be excluded from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The infringement was caused by an unrespective attack by Hector Moreno in 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw was broken into the PSV.
He was treated in nine minutes on the game field and needed sugar before he was put into the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double infringement and is in the hospital."
He'll be shooting tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operate in Manchester.
It's horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it's very hard and then plays fantasticly, and then it happens.
In the shift cabin, he had a sugar mask.
He's sweet.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then you're going to last six months, and he's not going to play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed to be happy to get away a red map and the slaughter of a one-mile feet.
Nicola Rizzoli, the Schiedsman, did not punish the Mexicoans.
Van Gaal summarized that the Italian Scheedsman was struggling.
You can judge yourself when I say that a metro and a red map were covered.
It was a very worse attack with two legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your news. Words can't describe how hard I am, my way to Genesis begins now, I'll return stronger."
Regarding this: Manchester United leads the loss of Luke Shaw at the PSV
The Defender of England has encouraged the European Meeting in France to get up until June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV Trainer, said, "It's a very bad damage."
If a player with this kind of injury leaves the place, they're all very tragic about it.
It's never the purpose of our player to hurt a enemy.
Moreno experiences an invasion when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland Mannance at WM 2014.
"He makes himself very hard because it wasn't his hope to hurt the enemy, and if you hear that it is a very bad damage, it's not good," said Cocu.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction, so that it was like if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In the conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also put into the hospital - after a shooting game by Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David knows Cameron The Lorax better?
It's a thing that all parents learn: If your child loves a book, it's not long until you almost know it.
If you're not, you may be David Cameron.
When he was requested by a supplier of children's care systems to appoint his favorite Kin's book, the President of The Lorax decided to be Mr. Seuss, a environmental facility appearing in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the Super Camps company website, and continues: "Light, moved, creative, and with powerful message, it is a book that I like to read my children, because it seems always to give a image or a message that we have passed."
All nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron properly describes the action of the book, returns a record of the 2012 film version to add the new characters and details to extend the very short original text.
“In the swimming town of Thneed-Ville, where all the nature went and even the air is a good, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by he wants to see a true tree,” he reads. A lovely interest was Dr. Seuss, whose right name was the theodor Seuss Geissel and died in 1991, but unknown.
As if this wouldn't be sufficiently suspect: The text presented by Cameron is partly read as the collection of the Lorax film that is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and begins: "In the outstanding town of Thneed-Ville, where all is artistic and even the air is a product, a boy's named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl to win his dreams."
Although he allows to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron’s acting of the book is so little inconsistent. Here is an innocent young man, such as the local environment by the currency, falling trees, thneed striking once-lers, despite the Protests of the named Lorax, a shocking, "they speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely a relatively low PR expense was delegated to a helper who had not read the Lorax 20 times behind a child.
A Downing-Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's election circle.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text of Cameron's employees was delivered, but no more immediate comments were given.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England, but it's still hard
On Pakistan to shoot in the United Arab Emirates, it is a difficult task, but if you have chosen the Framework that England has chosen for the tour, you see a repeating of 3-0 test series series is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude any extraterrestreat.
Alastair Cook's page may be less learned than the three years ago, but there are good sponsor players in the Batting exhibition, and the Community's spirit is strong; they will not be angry of 2012, just a youth-positive position.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developed as Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size on the test level, is an option for the attack.
Attention to this: Adam Lyth is separated from the English test card and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth, of course, is hard to analyze for me as his chief resident in Yorkshire.
At its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple, but hard reality is that cricket players are directed on results.
There was no question signs at Joe Root, for example, and this leaded to the namement, there - and I told it previously - the players are their own best choices.
A long time ago, you had extended Lyth's run, but he had the control over his own switch.
If he hopes to explode further runs for Yorkshire, there is another chance.
The British Trainer Trevor Bayliss loving his position, even though he did not produce so good performance, and it didn't surprise me; especially he is a team man.
The question how much time a test slagman receives to set his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven opportunities - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton received the opportunity for home and foreign games.
The only project that you can raise was that England first introduced Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in maximum form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a shooting man I'm swearing.
He is a X-factor cricket player, which we first saw at Yorkshire in this season when he reached 236 against us on a train bridge place, which was very close to us.
He must receive at least the same chances as those before him, but this is obvious of the mansion in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moen shoot next to cookies what brings a extra spin bowler and would get four quicks, shoot up, and I didn't know anything.
I don't see why a slaughter can't shoot there, and this left country has already shown that he's a devil of cricket players.
Moen may have not completed his job for his county Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for them, and there's no great difference.
My former team college Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drip before he was opener in 2001.
He did three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the castle as backup springers, and in my limited relationship with him, he impressed me as a young man.
People may look at their statistics - average 31 with the shooter and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there is no large number of backup sponsors that raise their hands and trainers have decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Unlike the manity, England has made some pleasant additions at the train table.
The name of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman of Sri Lanka, could be a master copy.
He is one of the most beautiful ones of the game that will bring a lot of experiences, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international Cricket competition, as player or coach, and how Mahela has thoughts we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices can take fresh winds in the shift cabin, even if the messages are in line with the previously sentence.
Colly's Team College at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One Dayyers, root obtained a similar suspension against Australia and I have no problem for my part.
Some are not agreed, but coachs and team employees do not determine the timeplan.
And you have to think that as with the players depends on their jobs from the results.
Such decisions are not taken in a light heart.
The Brexit Lager (Brexit = Growth of Britain from the EU) could be able to win if the economy is in a flat until 2017
David Camerons' unreasonable new negotiations strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be more deeply struggled every day without the choice of the famous Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as the leader of the Labour or the TUC, which is strongly destroyed because of Europe on Thursday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomate friend said newly that some Member States, so deeply cut into different crises, as the EU is now and not always because of their own debt, the agenda created by the United Kingdom itself with separate consents and devastating contract changes that they mostly do not want to do.
In Brighton, the TUC decided on its annual congregation that it should not be possible if they threaten the social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers kleed on meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign cities, make a photo of themselves before a famous local thinking, with or without local sizes, come home and say that they win partners for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants to see an external United Kingdom in the EU's area - "Do not be alone with France," says Berlin - and considers that more and more shorter ministers and officers in some major cities have come to the point where they are unlikely to stay or go.
Germany's careful Kansler Angela Merkel is a associate, but she has been in the power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it seems bad for her as it has been done in the long-term rewards like thatcher (11 years), Mediterranean (14) and Kohl (16).
Frances François Hollande is seeing its re-electment or replacement in 2017.
He's also a weird power.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will be cut off to help the Selfie Britain whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something that they do not want, because most of the similar trends have.
That is why some of these ministers may have planned even unnecessary observations in the SNP style, while the United Kingdom's reference campaign 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend is slow.
"The new negotiation was a party" and "Great Britain has won nothing from the new negotiation."
The Europeans know how the Fleet Street can be on their costs and what EU skeptics is the oligarchie of the Pressebarone, but it was not inspired by Tony Benn 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a relationship of 2:1.
You can slowly remember Boris Johnson, the Erz Euro Opportunist, who made a name as a "EU-Gerade-Banan" coherent in Brussels in the early 90s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This was the Medley of tax fears, phone-hacking foreigners and the Pseudo non-Irelands, which belonged to most of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought about them similar, but noted that when you sit with a warm Gorilla in a kitchen, you better distribute bananas to stop him instead of being his dinner and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairianer than Blair itself, when he opposed Cameron's Referendum, since Blair had established the principle of the non-accepted EU Constitution, which then was rejected by French and Dutch electioners in 2005, which opened him for a restraint.
The press has never come to him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly snake on the back on Monday in Westminster, - I told him that he no longer needed time to forgive me - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnocks Boykott Murdoch Strategy for the 80s, an error at the time and today.
It can duration, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but probably with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyns to Europe is - I'm so kindly pressing it in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most of the people outside Ukips traditional blue and the wild filling of Torys Klein-Englishism may say so everyone.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not Beneite" Benn in the radio and at the television this week when the path finger fighted in him, not to admit that Corbyns's name of the producing John McDonnell was a bad idea as shadow kantor.
It reminded me of the seventy-years when his old father tried to be loyal to his workshops, without going far and losing his kitchen job.
Hilary fight was still attractive.
But to fight to remain "with all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his colleagues and Members after all reports on their closure on Monday.
Whatever you want to give to Corbyn's shooting Bottom Up image - you think he even touched me - news-disciplin remains at the time of television around the hour, and before all things in the structure of social media, a Brust of Paranoia and Treasury.
It is right to give Cameron no free cards for Europe that allows him to maintain work support in the referendum campaign for self-conscience, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks that's sure.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic multitude of the EU membership - in accordance with its Benefits, its anti-kapitalist past - is no longer a question of the Estethic debate under links departments, for which the Narzismus of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatical conflicts.
As with its several details to Nato - Tom Watson, the false feast is convinced that JC does not start a campaign for the arrival - foreign diplomas are obliged to try to find a sense for their own officers.
Why should Paris or Berlin leave political capital, - they have also misstrayed elections - to make responsibilities to the British, if all this can be uncomfortable?
The United States are already quite depressed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a decrease of the Tory government at the power, which I have been reminded of what was called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize report of Public Health England on e-Zube cigarettes
Insurances of a Stately financed Agency that e-smokers are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 persons, partially with smoke industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) are closed to start by criticating the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-sigarettes.
PHE published the "global report" in the last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have investigated the loadableness of the data and have focused on the connections between some experts and the tabak industry.
The last month in the Medical Journal Lance, the "excellently wine-based basis" was based on the PHE's most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the audiences "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor for Clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
They said that publicity expected that "the current estimation is that e-smoking is about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were called to develop a model for a multi-specific decision-making analysis (Multi-critical Decision Analysis - MCDA) to bring their opinions on the damages of different nicotin content products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were collected in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a meeting sponsor was a company named EuroSwiss Health whose business leader was to have received before British American Tobacco Ressources (BAT) for an independent study.
He also subscribed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants was declared to receive resources from an e-smoking producer but not the financing he had to receive before the Tabak company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of members of the body are not delivered, but there are several known e-smoking champions, some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in the Tabak control.
The Tabak Directorate of PHE also took part at the meeting.
The research work of the group "is significantly covered", wrote McKee and Capewell, is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most of the products".
However, there is no discussion of these connections or limitations in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's audiences were not evidence that e-smoking was a way to serve for children or non-smokers.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director for Health and Reality at PHE, said that BMJ's appeal was already reacted before.
He said, "E-Tigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Each second smoker dies in his search.
All evidence are closely shown that the health risks of e-smoking are reduced in comparison with this, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what is evidence and not what, especially if there are so many public consciousness about relative dangers compared to tabak.
About 80,000 people die each year at a smoking disease, and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year.
The clear presentation of current evidence that e-smoking is not without risk, but only a brown of the damage caused by the cigarette is complied with our national responsibility.
BBC should leave EastEnders, says former Chief of channel 4
The former Chairman of channel 4, Luke Johnson said BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivales "It's going to give right arm" for Hit shows like Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the round funding cost should only be used to make the type of programs not sent by other UK senders.
He criticized the BBC that it would like to place public and legal programs that probably be seen by a smaller public, in a heart-reached temporary window against the most popular shows of their rivals and sentences like BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at channel 4 without success.
"I have had problems with the idea that BBC programmes are in charge or sent, which would also be clearly shown by non-subventioned rivals", said Johnson to the Supreme House Communication Committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the round funding expenditures, what I do not think for a good idea or long-term, you should at least make its production on programs that others do not or give them in order.
They send The Voce into a first-class time window because they want to achieve the most wide support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a widow, it's crazy, it's naturally unbelieving.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a returning tax program is financed, which could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is a such program, EastEnders is another, given both own productions.
Really said that other canals would give their right arm towards it.
I try to see how this should be public and legal television.
I don't think that the BBC would never decrease.
Johnson, a employee for series, which led to channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC debt to the jagd after evaluations "as the ambitions of people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments on BBC's most popular sendings returned to what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in its MacTaggart proposal in Edinburgh in 2003 predicted that BBC shows should be sold as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the most public and legal Niska programs should go to BBC4 where you can't measure the public, but they meet their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their likely missions to justify 4 billion £ round fees, "No, of course, we have created all these obscured programs that didn't have seen."
They're putting them into a time window where no one's ever wanted to see her.
Johnson said to the Committee: "I ask you to find a higher return system in terms of conditions who can receive the best value from this.
Of course, you all think we all think that you receive a great value for 150 £ per year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £, ask me whether that's true, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky and channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also addressed before the Committee on Tuesday, requested the BBC to review its Reithian mission, "inform, form and maintain."
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of its television production and 0.1% in radio - and it should take an example in "Informing, explaining and maintaining."
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that BBC should do more in areas than the proms, which he said that only one handful is shown in the television, and income with commercial alliances to make everything available online.
'soonogenetics' can control brain cells by steel wool
The video shows how nemathodes change the direction in the moment where they are distracted with ring spines.
Scientists have struggled grains with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by shoes of shoes.
The changing nemathodes change the direction at the moment when they have high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
Impuls works by enableding motoneuron cells that are genetically changed to bring the membrane channels that react on Ultraschall wools.
More to this topic: Read and write hipness with light
The researchers said to show the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, can be used at the ultralace to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreecanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla (California) said to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep symptoms of the Parkinson disease, a invasive procedure, the electric impulse in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson disease.
In general, they did not react on Ultraschool, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were rounded by a liquid with microscopic air blends.
The brown, he found out, strengthened the Ultraschall wools that then enter into the dark.
The increased ultra-scale waves affect the structures called TRP-4-ionian channels and are found in the membranes of some of the warm cells.
The waves affect the opening of these ion cannes and active the cells they are assigned, so a report Nature Communications.
In order to create Ultraschall controlled nemathodes, Chalasani genetically changed the wheels so that some of its moto-euroones TRP-4-ion canadians.
If it applys ultrascale to the changed creatures, the steel waves will be enhanced by the microbloods and transferred to the wools where they enter the modified motonurones.
The procedure has some differences with optogenetics, a skilled tool that allows the scientists to keep up and switch neurons with lamp impulses.
But Chalasani said that Songenetics could have some advantages against this technology.
On the contrary to light, which must be sent to the desired place in the brain, weighing frequencies can pass unhindered tissue and can soon be sent to the brain from above on the shadow.
"We believe that with genetherapy and therapeutic virus is possible to make human neurons immediately adverse for Ultraschall syndrome in clinical position for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin production cells, he added.

The exhibition of the British arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Waffen View Messen-Video.
Awesome murder drones!
Footballs shocked infessels!
Striubomben!
And electric shock shocks that cause skin pain, but no scene left!
The joyful voice and the carton images do not doubt that this show for the world's largest weapons measuring is a struggle parodie produced by Amnesty International in order to bring the UK government's disposal to destroy repressive weapons over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree in the ExceeL Centre in London Docklands.
Vacuum: DSEI arms-messe: Authory Regime Stripes to London
But a separate campaign also leads to many placeholders that are seen in bus and in the U-Bahn trains and require a second view.
"Avery advertising: walk from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads the types of London Underground and the marks of the DLR line that turns to the image of a panzer.
In September, a black of weapons drives with the DLR... customers will be requested to help when stop the weapons.
The 300 places are of artists who have performed their work at the Museum for Great Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A colleague named Special Patrol Group helped to distribute in London and use "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £ package of inbus keys, which is observed that "to reach a third of the bus-holding surfaces on the planet".
Transport for London does not find this "Vandalism".
One of the Parodie shows produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, Kurator of Crueol Designs and Dozent at the University of Essex, artists will be critical and tried to bring political works to public work outside the galleries.
Many artists are taking place with active artists within the protection movements to work and noting that they must be left out in the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade plates is the pendler in the U.
Amnesty-Video was seen over 100,000 times in 24 hours by Facebook, and was found by the VCCP advertising agency who works with the graphic and voceover artists, who also works freely.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was sweet about the style that runs around the advertising for the weapons - through a empty place of the ExCeL calendars - and thought: "We give them the campaign that they try to avoid".
They played with the creation of a more realistic slight company, but "the involvement with light colors and animation remains stronger captive".
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us to make awareness about the sale of illegal punishment equipment on the messe, says Tom Davies by Amnesty.
What we need now, is an agree of the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices are not being treated illegally before our home door.
Maybe the most creative art around the weapon measuring goes out of the area within exceL, where exhibitors are fantasticly destroyed euphemistic products.
In a press communication, Saab reveals a duty of the US army on "the AT4CS RS assaulted by the slaughter".
This includes a "single-formed shooting cap, which provides extraordinary effects of impact within the objective."

Eight golden rules for life in student homes
11 years ago, I moved as self-forgettable 19-year-old boys in a home of students, still in faith in Berket and moral relations, but now I remember those whom I had poor - and to the many, long-term complaints about others.
The majority I've learned can be dismissed in eight simple rules.
The income in students homes is sufficiently nervous until absolutely threatening.
It's funny to join: people tell where you're coming, whether and where you've taken a Saturday year, where you're talking about Corbyn and why you're "really saying Marmits nor hate, because in reality, boys, it's just a heffective Hahaha, I'm in my room."
Have you been breathing.
And help others to do the same - set questions and show interest.
It lends the conversation and helps you to find the people you like to do in contrast to those with whom you would not speak, even if your whimpers were in Brand and would be these firesavers.
Let people.
People's rooms are often converted into drinking receptions, film nights and communal meetings, but they are also the places in which people get into and justify their subcontracts.
Regarding this: Do not think about starting at the Uni with a relationship
Introverted receives a great treatment at the university.
Its room should be a refugee, but many students living homes form a room-to-bum culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to long-term friendship.
This can be the hell for someone who tries to get back.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to continue our friendship, but you have to go away so I can get the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a combination of severeness is created - and send him a SMS instead.
Apropos: Do it.
A man in my student houses had the idea that a not closed door was a invitation.
He saw some things.
A friendship closed by the back.
Since you start the Unio at the top of the back-many, the shooting is at the doors of people to present with a fully brown, less rare than the satisfaction of the 1950-year-olds "Well in the neighborhood, I have backed you something. So, please smile if I put you a few personal questions."
Provide house-case leckery is a good way to close friendships.
Your neighbors feel obliged to hold up and may finally associate your face with a quiet surprise.
Of course, it depends on whether you are a qualified bathroom.
Several missing skins from meat, sugar and fat leads people to sleep when you get to bed.
Stolen food, it's a decent crime in students' homes.
Of course, the claw of dogs is a sleeves, but is it also the taking a thick milk for your tea?
Check this with the milk steel.
The chances are good that they say to serve yourself, even if they cook inside.
If someone smells your things, that's bad, and you have my compassion - but try to do more equitable than my cousin who added to her milk to punish meat.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a laugh that stops people from sleep or work.
It's not just to be a qualified person, but that you belong to those who sit in the glass house in the true sense of the word.
One girl on my fleet asked their neighbors whether it seems to be something slower to drum & Bass because it was three hours tomorrow, and she had a test at morning.
They reacted with a laugh music.
When she finally stopped at 5:00 p.m, she left her neighbors friendly sleeping still two hours before she left her own music, cut off her door, and took himself to her trial test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if you would enter a future mate into the same student home?
Wishing it would not be desperately worse if you keep a neighbor for your future mate, strike on them, divided up, and then they must see every day and may live, how they are about all the common friends?
Of course, the heart comes in his own way - but if a warm neighbor is definitely not your future partner, try at least to make your sublife a little consciousness.
In the moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his non-concluded room, the border between an Ulk and Mobbing is quiet as it seems.
A good strike is sweet, but it's just a moment until he becomes a bumerang.
Give a valuable and charming lesson about security by hide - but never give any room with dentists and shampoo.
Close their door, and put their keys into a glass water that you then put into the fridge - but do not fix their ownerships on the board more than two times.
several households for refugees, single-driven, guest drivers
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner built in the Mediterranean eckental houses for people who have no money.
So about the refugees - but also as a signal: "Do not only refugees need a living room, but also the single mother learning and the manager."
"I tell you how you can still build a good and well today," says the 44-year-old girls in the interview.
Thousands of refugees will be cut on the accommodation market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how fast the living room can be created: he builds a series house for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be cut on the accommodation market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive submission in containers or tournhals does not have sustainability.
Because people remain a large part of this.
In view of the refugee stream, we also need sufficient residence in the coming decades.
A totally banal, three-scale row house is the solution.
Gildner: A series house needs at the least place.
It facilitates integration.
It's different if you're interrupting the people in the households.
Each of the six houses that are built just in the pilot project consists of three units for every four asylum applicants.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it's again peace, I'll go back.
Then the houses can easily be converted according to the needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of residence per house is located at 184 000 euros, without basement.
It's overwhelming.
Six months have longed the building.
That's appropriate.
Has the construction rules complicated their plans?
Gildner: I have done my project correctly.
Especially complicated it is always the threatening hamokless weight of special construction and the position regulation.
Gruselig.
It is still understood who created three apartments in a series house, needs at least three locations.
Only in the towns lack the place.
And refugees and asylum applicants have no cars.
How have the inhabitants reacted to their series house project?
Gildner: There were those who planned me to make luxus constructions for asylum applicants.
What's definitely not true.
But do you not raise the competition campaign for payable apartments?
Gildner: Really: In the past five years we had a tree in Germany, but we were built in the Luxury houses that couldn't be able to offer one more.
My project has the message, also the normal people need a living room.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or manager.
I tell you how to build a good and well today.
That's why it's okay.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regenburg and first worked with environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when published Apple updates
The new operating system can be requested by going to Settings app, tip "all" and then select "Software Updates".
If it is ready, the phone will be the option to download and then install.
Some have fallen on problems after installing, as they receive a error message that reports that the "Software update has failed".
To address the problem, users are recommended to wait until the switch returns or try to update iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean the removal of apps to create places - but Apple has made it unreasonable by disabled updates. It will also be easier to do this when you use a special tool, to remove apps, and then to install them once the process is closed.
It is pleasant to ensure that your mobile phone is downloaded during the update or is close to a loading device, so that the battery is loaded.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, since the phone may be disabled on half-way and it could lead to a decline of the update.

Rosbergs only devices: Full Attack
Nico Rossberg knows in the fight about the WM titles in form 1 against his leading Mercedes team Lewis Hamilton is only one of the devices: "Folle Attack".
The WM range stressed the decisive seven overseas, "what I don't have to lose anything more."
53 points are divided by the Vice-World Meister in Singapore on this Sunday of the Defense and Two-face Champion Hamilton.
The UK has already winned seven of the 12 saison rains and takes the Flood Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite attack.
2009 and last year, British 30 years were able to win the wage.
Whether the current smog in the city will have an impact on the price of Singapore, it is still unexpected.
Since days, a dark glove is over the city, dissolved by breads on the neighborhood of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chach Club has a prominent member
The "Shachfriend Bad Kissings" launched three months ago has included another member in his lines, so the members number increased on 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate shooting and tennis player, who took place over 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is the leader of the Federal Service Cross 1, class and honor citizens of the towns Espel Camp and Lebbeke.
The Chach Club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a spend, which took the President Alfred Klein.
This is how it is possible to include chairs that cannot be able to put the member's share.
Youth work and talent search should also be prepared.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chach club and also a friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" will be seen as an expression of his association with the city.
Quarter office searches for direct contacts
Saludis and the Old Centre Antonist have joined themselves in the manner of the Social Office and opened a new seat at the Graf-Stauffenberg plate.
In addition to discussions, you can also participate in courses.
The Social Institute is from the mountain in the city.
Exactly said to the Graf-Stauffenberg-platz.
There was recently opened a new Quarter office.
Here, directly in addition to the purchase market, are immediately obtained senior and requesting information on questions such as the assurance or the benefits of the hospital and firm cases.
For years, we have found with our ambulance service that often those who are swept are left alone.
There are, indeed, many questions.
"But there are no rarly many performances of the box, because the complexity of insurance is not yet understood", explained the new householder Jutta Weigand, who is responsible for the Antonist and Citizenship and for the ambulance service "Amadeus".
In addition to the discussions, the new Quartet Office also offers prevention, health courses and Wellness.
To this end, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as storm prevention, memoranduming or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers of the senior centre and the Saludis are ideally complemented.
Saludis is for prevention, precaution and reha.
"The senior Centre for Surveillance and Training", Heyke Riedel, Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new Quarter office in the city is to see both business leaders especially in the demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentral infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future is essential.
Furthermore, Mr Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) was understood at the meetings of the age, and the Quartet Office was also engaged in the age: "They have many events and offers on the programme and are invited to a regular assembly".
So the Social Foundation has a great contribution to the possibility of seniors to live in their own and reliable environment.
The Quarterbury is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 p.m., Sunday and Thursday from 16 to 18 p.m. and afternoon from 10 p.m. to 12 p.m.
Introduction Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on October 6

The meeting of the FC Introduction Bamberg in the asteelfinal of the Bayeric football Totopocals against the third-party FC Würzburger Kickers was now finally completed.
Played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 19 a.m. in the Bamberger Fuchs park station.
"We are happy that we are now knowing when the game goes over the bridges, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Carllein Chambers, which also refers to the now launched cart for sale.
It is special to play against a third-party.
We therefore hope many observers, and this is not without reason, because fluid light games have a special journey.
In the round of the last 16 agents, the FC entered Bamberg 2010 by winning at the district licensing 1. FC overhaid (3:1) and at home against regional licenses 1. FC Scheinfurrt 05 (3:2).
The winner of competition receives 5000 euros and is qualified for the first round of the DFB Convention 2016/2017.
Defender is a third-legal SpVgg Subhaching.
Wiener Architect Karl Mang 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the physicians of the Vienna Architecture, is dead.
He was already dead on 5 September in the age of 92, as the artist house shared on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house loses a member of honor and also "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the exhibition.
1922, born in Vienna, Mang studied Mang during and after World War II Architecture at the Technical High School in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he worked as a free architect, but he was also as teachers, writers and institute leaders.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Formation.
In the 80s he was employed with the establishment of the shadow chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkowitz in the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Park Straf: Tim Wiese employs police with money
Ex-Fußballer Tim Wiese has been unexpected in Bremen.
Footballers were once, medium-scale, Tim Wiese, Ex-National Towers in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have made his own speech in the past two years.
However, it has not been intellectual.
Wiese just shooted the hair in the Bremer City when he saw a park room guarder exhibited a punishment store for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese shooting out of the business, ruling the officer and slaughtered the casual money penalties before the feet, as reports the "image" showing.
In the city of Bremen, you confirm the laws, but it is not clear that the consequences for the uncommon incident are still clear.
"The matter is still in the test," says the town of Bremen.
First of all, it will be decided whether Wiese is shown, or not.

Mans tested at a 17-year-old Afghan
The Witnesses are seeking the police for an accident in Bad Soden Salmstein: On Friday, against 23.45 hours, three young men were walking by Bad Soden in direction of Salmünsters.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghanistan, followed the police's two friends in a distance of about five feet and called them to wait for him.
At this time the group was at the height of the bft channel.
There were also three persons on the park of the tank station.
One of these men now crys to the youth and shouted this with the false face.
The victim has a nausea burned and blew strongly out of the nase.
When his two friends came up and shocked to the slaughter, he first left his sacrifice.
From his friends, the blessed young man now came home.
The murder continued the group with a Pkw to its apartment and was demonstrated more times.
When you don't see the vehicle anymore, the lost went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the slaughter and another man.
In support of a slaughter, the face and the upper ring of the victim were checked.
The latter had to be brought to a hospital.
There is only a low description of death.
One of the men was about 1,80 m large.
The second shooter would have been large to about 1,65 m and was waiting for a jans and a brain-wheel.
The police requests witnesses and instructors to report under phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes the practice of rock houses and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (of the left) take the practices of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel rock houses.
Moreover, Samt Communist Meister Bernd Bormann, economic promotion Uta Seim Schwartz and Asendorf Citizensmeister Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places the country has lacked doctors - Asendorf, however, happiness: where Dr. Frank Müller takes the practice of rock houses on October 1st.
While Ursel Felsenhauses goes in peace, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, remains his followers in the next months with a half place.
After a rebuilding phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then invests 310000 euros in spaces at the St. Marcellus Strategy 6.
It was sympathy at the first time when Frank Muller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Muller-Gongoll, were aware of their special training at the Green Headquarter of the Hospital House, who now wants to get to practice the next year.
"We always had in the backhead that the mullers would be good in this practice," said Dr. Ursel Felsenhauses and laughed.
"If it was so long, I just called them."
The wife Müller found the idea to work in the future in Asendorf.
"The nearness and continuous contact with patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to know and join the families over the years."
As a advantage, he also sees to be his own chief soon.
And so you were agreed that the mullers bought the house with the practice.
Residents will still be in the Bruchhausen flights.
The two-fold family parent Frank Müller has grown, his medical study in Hannover, in several medical practices, as well as in hospital hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is now operating as the Supreme physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed to the leading Notarzt in the circs deep deep and engaged in the DRK board of Bruchhausen flights.
Since September 19, the practice is prepared for the new chief.
During the surgery, Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felsenhauses worked as a home physician, his Gattin Ursel (Internist) specialized on the gastroenteriology.
The Mullers, both internalists, want to be denied as a home physician.
"The Endoscopie is therefore out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will appear more modern.
We will offer more Ultraschall support research and long-term ECGs and need more conversation rooms.
Furthermore, the EDV is completely renewed.
A total of EUR 50000 are granted to the Müllers in the framework of a country crystal support programme (25000 euros) as well as the Summit Community (12500 euros) and the Community (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and joy we are to continue the practice," emphasizes Samt-Gemeer Bernd Bormann.
About 2000 patients are reported that Silvia Müller-Gongoll is coming to the practice of rock houses, where the northern German average practice is about 500.
In Asendorf, there is another home physician practice.
A positive side effect of the practices of Frank Müller: The Apotheke remains according to the Ursel rock houses in Asendorf.
If no follower had found, she would have gone.
In other words, who visits Mullers’ speech meetings, it continues to look mainly in confidence faces: overcome the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the rock houses.
With their appointment, a time ends in Asendorf, however, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"After we had only two rooms," Ursel stone houses remembered.
It's a little weakening, and it's been a long time.
"What we live in Hohenmore, and many patients will still be sure," says the internalist.
Your man laughs: "We have a 6000-quaratmeter board."
"I've always been pressed before the garden work, now it could be different."
Moreover, the couple has two necks and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"There will also be highlighted at our southern border," said Minister of Internal Affairs, Johannesa Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain parallel to it.
It is clear that everybody who wants to make an asylum could do this as well as "something understanding".
The insurance and safety of people is in advance.
However, it is clear that "what it needs a clear signal", said the Minister.
People have to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, not even through the Austrian-Slovenian borders.
It needs a controlled procedure.
Croatia referred to as "Corridor" - Refused Slovenia
The Kroatian Government had previously informed, and Slovenia also wants to continue to continue towards Austria and Germany, and also create corruption for refugees.
However, this is not the case of the Minister of Internal Affairs, Vesna, the Znidars Znidar in Laibach.
Corridorn's idea is "absolutely inacceptable", Slovenia will increase the monitoring of the borders, especially to Hungary.
However, the borders with Croatia have been strongly controlled as the external borders of the Schengen area.
As the Minister emphasized, Sloveni is not going to make its borders for refugees.
"All Members of the EU must carry out their obligations, otherwise the system cannot work", emphasizes Znidar.
As the Croatian Government informed, the first refugees had already tried to travel in the Tuvalunik/Sid in Eastern Croatia at the border of the Tovarnik/Sid in order to avoid the registration.
The Kroatian police could attack her in the nearest landscapes.
According to local media, they have been meeting permanent police vehicles with new refugees since the Kroatian Tovarnik.
It is predominantly addressed to Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Saving services and the red cross were already in use.
In the coming days, his country was counted with about 4000 refugees, said Minister of Internal Affairs, Ranko Ostojic.
Furthermore, buses from Presevo would be carried out from the Macedonic-Serbian borders that had brought migrants to the Hungary borders in Croatia and reported the Croatian and Serbian media in the midnight.
However, the Government in Belgrado is that it is to show people to strike certain routes: "We can no longer, nor we want to do this," said it.
According to the media reports, in each morning a first bus with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border city was reached, there would be more bus in the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The invasions were through Serbia the entire night from the macedonic borders from about 500 miles away.
"We have heard that Hungary loved us, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could, in fact, come to some further western trails that have already been moved by observers of the previous Balkan Red Balkans of Turkey and Greece, Macedonia and Serbia.
Croatia: "Increased opportunities for border control"
Kroatian Internal Minister Ostoic had previously emphasized that his country had prepared for the case of a strong stroke of refugee plans for possible exceptional situations.
In detail, he did not point out that Croatia had "complete opportunities to control borders".
strict controls are conducted to qualify the membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, the EU partners have given the country a good witness for the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, the Hungary border chain continues to fix about 300 refugees.
According to Belgrader's media reports, they would have passed the winnered night on the border crossing Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two cross-border Horgos and Backi Breg continues to be completely locked.
If the remaining refugees want to continue to the Croatian border, it is still unexpected.
The Serbian Interior Minister Neboojsa Stefanovic still tried to relax a local appearance in Horgos: he held the debates on alternatives of refugees after the Hungarian border closed.
It would not be a very high number of refugees today.
You can't even tell if they would continue their journeys on Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helps Rating Migrants - dangerous - Alternatives
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already started to distribute refugee cards where alternative routes are signed by Croatia.
However, the cross-border cross-border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia war, there are still unlooked mining fields.
On Wednesday, the Kroatian police announced that a team of mining spaces was sent to the border region.
Börsen-Hacker: Ukrainian payment $30 million
Supraanok is intended to have heard to a ring of Cyber Criminals who will be proposed to have been re-experienced in still unpublished financial reports and press communications on websites such as business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire.
The information provided should be made on the financial markets by the insider.
In this way, the investigators were totally assembled over $100 million.
"The present comparison shows that even those outside our country are finally captured", says the SEC Communication.
The processes against 32 other accused persons were delayed in the case.
Most of the detainees were from Ukraine and Georgia.
The murders should have acted both in the United States and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenic Hospice Hospital Manheim has been held for 20 years
Run around the man home parade place is a rigorous operation.
People are able to achieve their concerns, partially fast steps, partially swimmingly.
You are controlling the two stations of the man home autosalons at the paradeplace.
Keep the city trains.
Polsiting, beautiful life in wonderful original sunrise and medium-term four large tables everywhere with the title "After I want to die."...
The Ecumenic Hospice Assistance took attention to its 20-year-old existence and seems to be mixed with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we're walking with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," said Josefine Lammer.
The Chief of the Ecumenic Hospital Assistance also provides for questions and discussions as well as honorary workers.
While a passenger spontaneously strikes to the circle, and the script for "Mean life", "lease," "by the camper through the United States," "the war stop" or "no long suffering", others remain slow, read, say "so far I'm not still" and then go.
On the border, small discussions on action are being developed, about life, the relationship with the death.
Peter Hübinger's just right over there.
"But if I make clear that for me the end of this world I can live responsiblely", says the Director of the Diaconic Worker Home, which is together with the Caritas Association Force of Ecumenic Hospis.
It is therefore good for the 20-year-old public action.
However, it is comprehensive that not everyone wants to share publicly on the tables, finally it is a very personal thing.
The thema of death and deaths has been arrested as before Tabus, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, although just in the past few years the hospis movement has contributed to the opening of people.
An appreciation that is shared by Angelica Godefroid.
The death and tragic member belongs to the honorary workers of the first hour.
By personal experiences, they faced the subject, read a lot of literature and decided to join themselves in the death aid.
When the Ecumenic Hospice aid was searched for honor officials, she was immediately reported and had been founded in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 Ehren officials - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the employees and members in private households, hospitals, homes and in the Hospise Sankt Vincent.
They're all careful.
Angelika Godefroid can work well with its task and experiences and experiences.
"I see the life of another wait, it was costly and valued the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant Ecumenic Hospital Service is free and independence.
Financial support for the hospital cases and costs of families and malnutrition allows training, training and supervisions of the mortal and tragic partners.
Every two years, training will be offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now presented in the house of the evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There can also be more personal desires on postcards.
Mixed FedEx result, calculated financial views for 2016
FedEx reports an enormous results for the last quarter, and the delivery Gigant sent his profit view over a whole year because of the weaker demand for shipping services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said she planned to spend about 55,000 season workers for the holiday.
FedEx announced at this time in the last year that the company wants to set up 50,000 season workers for the holiday time.
The share was more than 2,5% in the Premarket-Handel 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp said a win between $10,40 and $10,90 in the business year, which ends in May next, 20 cent less than at the previous predict.
Analysts expected to investigate FactSet $10.84.
The lower perspective is, despite price increases in average 4,9% and effectively on 4 January, and even higher contributions to land transport of severe and large packages that are risen from November.
The company said, however, that the results of the previous year will be increased because of cost reduction, higher revenue and because of the growth in the online sector.
Chairman and the CEO Fred Smith said that the company "soled income, if the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade, is considered".
The plans for vacation jobs were announced a day later than the UPS Rival, which plants, 90,000 to 95.000 additional workforces, including the same number as in the last year.
In the Quartal, which ended on August 31, FedEx $692 million, 6% more than in the previous year.
The result of the share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which predicted 12 of Zacks Investment Research analysts.
The surplus increased by $5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
6 of Zacks questioned analysts expected $12,23 billion.
FedEx has decreased a decline in the international priority sending in recent years, which led the transfer into its Express sending to stagnar.
But the tree in the online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the transfer of land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operational result was often due to higher costs for larger packaging and self-assurance.
The Express unit marked higher income due to higher prices, while the result of higher labour costs in charge.
In the Premarket Head, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares $3.85, or $2.5 percent, at $ 150.15.
On Thursday, she concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record hook on 11 June.
At its most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserves Strategy two days this week sits around a 27-festate Honduras-Mahagoni-Tish to decide whether it is time for the first time to increase the leitzins for almost a decade.
A changing image of the United States is threatened at the end of the two-sixth meeting room.
The map is a reminder that the President Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a duplicate task by the Congress: the maximization of the US employment and the prices are stable here.
But since the big recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is a third mandate that is not written: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predict it. On Thursday, it will be known whether the US will be prepared to be decreased by the short-term interest rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although the majority of the economic data shows that they are strongly growing, the recent turbulences to the global financial markets could make the predicted Fed representatives anxiety to strengthen this volatility by increaseing the interest of federal loans - and it is only a fourth percentage point.
"Openly, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief-economist at the Macler Company Stiff Nicolaus & Co.
"Af I think if they were looking for an incentive to not increase the interest rate, the increased insecurity around the global market is sufficiently justified to continue," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which makes itself aware of the financial market.
Some half of the economists who were asked recently from Bloomberg have predicted an increase in the interest rate this week.
However, the financial markets expect a delay of the Fed, with a key indicator that shows only 30% opportunity to increase.
This decreases on a decline in the share market, if the Fed increases the rate, except that the strategies decline the slaughter by promised that another increase is far away.
On Thursday, the Dow Jones' Industrial average is 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was resolved by expectations that the Fed policy holds the word this week, said John Lonski, Chief-Chairman at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would have the seats at this time," he said.
If she do it, "we must go in her declaration very far to calm the financial markets so that they do not in panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would be based on the financial markets because they would eliminate the insecurity of when the Fed is acting.
Another month ago the Fed seemed to have a good way to increase the number of 0.25 percent points in this month, the first small step in a long-term strengthening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that in this year, despite the complaints of liberalians, it would be necessary for more economic progress to increase the rate.
Although the creation of jobs was slow in August, the improvement on the labour market was solid in this year.
The unemployment rate is nearly 5,1% in the last month, which has been lower than seven years and near the level of the Fed as a full employment.
Repayments have shown signs of recovery.
While the inflation was continuously under the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said that the main ground was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "possess higher interest rates and needs it because of the labour market enhancement," said Ian Shepherdson, Chiefconom at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets in the whole world were together over the last months after China had estimated its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average in May increased more than 16 % under its maximum, as investors feared that a delay of the Chinese economy would dry the global growth.
The market has taken something in this month, while the Dow is now about 10% below the height of May.
For the representatives of the Fed, the market turbulences affect the complex calculation when the interests are to be increased.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would be able to accompany them in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and an ex-actor of the US Note Bank.
Now he said they will wait at least a month to get better effects on the griff.
" There is a lot of insecurity about what the effects on the United States will be, and there is almost no perceived data that describe the developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be included technically in its decision-making.
But finally, the Fed Monetary Authority has become the world's.
The impact of the Central Bank was enormous in the last few years.
The only indication of the former leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "reverse" its monetary expansion could solve confusions around the globe.
In a world where markets and people's economies are increasingly broken, the Fed representatives may be expected to monitor developments not only in other places, but also advise with other central banks and experts to get better understanding for the global economy.
Your decision-making is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the ownership management of the company Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, noted this month, that "the Fed has a history of overactions in financial market movements that seem to be not linked to the financial data."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who sets up decisions quoted in 1998/1999, for example.
A financial crisis in Asia made the Fed to reduce its leaders at 0.75 percent points in three meetings "notwithstanding limited recognisable impact on growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives returned these cuts.
The Fed should take the first place the aspects of the financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market summarized in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, equivalent member of the Committee for the Investigation of the Bank of England.
The most recent turbulences are not close to this level, said he.
"They certainly don't want to go into the situation in which she feared an increase in the interests because the markets are on the market," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until it is changed, I do not believe that it should predict the time.

Brazilian pediatric society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy styles
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to declare shockingly how important good food is during the lifetime. It makes this with the representation of images of babys that are shocked to Brussels, which are shocked with shows of unsane food.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, feeds, vitation and carbon hydrocarbons which gives babys all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
As a result of additional energy demands, pregnancy and young mothers will generate to increase their daily calorial increase of about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results pointed out that a higher calorious increase is not the only diagnostic adjustment to the mother.
A present study under the leadership of Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor Medicine College in Texas, showed that a healthy feeding of pregnant women actually relates to the gene of her babys and protects the tumors before development.
Unfortunately, unheilable food of the child may affect immune systems negatively.
Exemptions for the new sport chale
The Commonwealth Council Bernried authorized the construction application for the EUR 2.3 million tear sport chain.
And he made an exception.
The toilet may be more flashed for the solar system.
The plans for the long-reached tournale construction at the Bernrijer Sports are forwarded to step: In the recent community Council meeting, the constructed application has been simplified without great discussions.
Previously, the body had decided, among other things, an application for a constructional "except" respective "exemption" of the valid construction plan.
In the "exception" it was the authorisation for a special form regarding the roof building.
This aims to be created a "station with non-method first and duty transition".
The planning is the planned use of the solar board: "We have a wonderful large southern together", said Master Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
In the "free" it was again to be the smoothing that should be under ten degrees of energy - otherwise prescribed in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is significantly reduced.
A "free" was therefore necessary because the construction plan does not allow "exemptions" - by which the Communist Council regularly enables more restrictively for exemptions.
However, in Turnhallenbau, it is not a re-recurrenced project: "We do not create an event of presentation", says Steigenberger.
The tournhall construction of the Sport Center is a Community project of the Community and the SV Bernried.
In costs, around 2,3 million euros are calculated.
Subsidies are expected to be supported by the school and width sport.
The next procedure is presented to the Country Council for 18 x 36 meters of large halls.
Clinic Pügnberg goes to Schongau
The Hospital Pöpfenberg hospital should be closed previously than planned — 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fisher (66) will be a new doctor in the hospital of Schongau.
The stations and the majority of employees move from Pöpfenberg to Schongau.
This presents the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the countrycreen, confirmed by the Countryline Andrea Jochner.
However, a decision is taken by the Supervisory Council, which is day afternoon, 23 September.
If the plans are implemented, all the 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital house in Pöpfenberg.
The overwhelming majority has to turn into Songau with fishermen and the continued internal station.
The rooms exist.
The employees who can't be able to songau offer a job in Weilheim, so Jochner Weiss.
The employees were informed about the plans.
The changing has been resolved by Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been the doctor of Songauer Clinic since the beginning of the year, and has now changed to a private practice in the immediate nearness of the hospital.
When the question who would take the follow-up came Jochner's wisdom, the name "Fischer" in the game which was ready to declare to take the leadership from 1 October and change with his team to Songau.
For the house in Schongau, this was a "assessment" and a dissemination of the offer in the area "Inner Medicin", so Jochner.
Fisher is a specialist for cardiacs and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized at the internal station on gastroenterological diseases.
For the next two years, fishermen and his team, if the supervisory Council agreed to carry both houses, should be finally closed in Peghnberg for almost 140 years in the next year.
The farmer had planned this for 2018 when the current sanction of the hospital Weilheim was completed.
Landestin Jochner, who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Council, was able to be used as a accommodation for asylum users.
"I concluded." As it continues with the real estate, Jochner was not able to say that it gives several discussions.
There is now a short time of the Caritas and a daily psychiatrie.
"What the best couldn't happen to us, such an opportunity can't come again", so fishers have been included by the "posittive and very comprehensive" workers.
A real perspective for the house in which fishermen work as Chefarzt for over 30 years have not given it.
He was requested by Schongauer colleagues to take the positions of the Medical Director.
In the past decades, the Hospital Pöthnberg (e.g., 100 beds) was always threatened to closure, the departments were closed, for example, the surgery and the birth aid.
The ballers of the Rhein Neckar Lewen are requested tonight (20.15) at the mountain HC.
In Wuppertal the clear favorite is the leader of the Federal Liga, however, there is no inheritance.

Refugees need accommodations: Study warning for accommodation difficulties
The situation on the German housing market has been encouraged.
Also, more refugees are looking for a payable rest.
The pressure on the accommodation market increases.
The social housing is a challenge.
Distribution fights on the German housing market have long been started.
With the incoming refugees and working demanders from the EU, more people are on a market that has already been over in many major cities.
They competite with income-free citizens for the last payable apartments.
To cover the request of payable apartments, 400,000 new units should be built each year until 2020.
This results in a study under the "Social Apartment" Association.
Comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
To miss 140,000 apartments.
Refugees are not obliged to live after the first three months of their residence than the asylum requesters.
Many then stood on the accommodation market and swimming in the long skins before the accommodations.
According to statistics, however, in the past year less than half of all asylum applicants lived.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only the increased refugee numbers.
The study also produces significant disappearance in the housing industry policy in the last few years.
Germany has a housing deficit, which will increase from year to year.
At present, about 770,000 living units were missing in the Balement areas, Matthias Sunther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults remained involuntary for a long time because of the fleet on the accommodation market in the "Mama Hotel".
In the major cities, the number of squaremeters per head should be first recovered in the past years.
To solve the problem, the "social housing" council proposes a new start.
The new encouragement to the social housing is to be re-established.
In this way, it could be rejected on the basic trade tax and the basis tax for promoting housing would be delayed.
Furthermore, it is necessary for attractive tax reimbursement opportunities.
The support programme for refugees from the KfW State Bank is now good at towns and communities.
A good week after the start of the Monday with €184 million was already launched more than half of the available EUR 300 million.
Now the project could even be cut off.
Refugees have free shipping: Croatia and Slovenia to Corridor
After Hungary, there is no more income, since more refugees choose the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces to give the distances through Slovenia to North without wardens.
It's dangerous, but it's the road.
Croatia wants to understand with the neighbouring Slovenia about the establishment of a corredor for refugees.
"I talked to the Slovenian Inland Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a coridor," said the Croatian Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen Zone.
Croatia is not the Schengen country yet.
After the decrease of the Serbian-Unarn borders, hundreds of refugees have been cut into Croatia to reach from there to Western Europe.
500 people have been over the borders of Tovarnik, reports the croatatic television RTL.
Hungary had cut his borders for refugees on Sunday.
New laws that were in force on the same day, there are also general asylum procedures in Hungary.
Croatia wants to pass the refugees.
The Croatian Minister Zoran Milanovic said, "You can travel, and we are preparing us to do this."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and reach something.
However, there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had attacked the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU-Neighborhood in the morning.
The majority of media reports were based on Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both with the bus and with taxes to the Serbian border city Sid.
Only after their arrival, they would have tried to reach the green borders to Croatia.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not shock on border rooms.
For this, the border stretches other dangers: there are still severe mines from the Yugoslavian citizen war in the 1990s.
Mine spacers must now create a safe path.
After Hungary, there is little more refugees after closing the borders.
On Thursday, the police had 366 people attacked.
Shortly before the tour on Monday, there was 9380 still.
The new Hungarian laws introduce the transfer and damage of the border chain as a criminal.
The Szeged border city was therefore introduced 35 criminal procedures.
The judges threatened prisons up to five years and the departure from the country.
The Immigration Authority reported that, on Thursday, 94 asylums newly established to the border were covered, almost all of them - in the main transition of Röszke.
Among the applicants, 13 families were with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still stopped there.
Nevertheless, practically, no more has a view to obtaining asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum applicants should be dismissed there.
Before the "Transit zone" in Russia, only few hundreds of refugees were gathered.
In Röszke, workers started to store this.
They gathered the mould left the ten thousands of people in the last weeks on the road.
Sperrgitters were decreased and one of the acquiring camps was transformed in the border.
For this purpose, nobody wanted to express himself.
Austria has reached only few refugees after closing the borders between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, there were still 20,000 immigrants in the country.
At Salzburg, about 1400 people were waiting for travel to Germany.
The movement from there to Germany was stopped on Sunday at the instruction of German authorities.
In free release, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived in foot.
Citizensman went on the borders
"We were employed after the bridge celebration on Sunday with the rooms when almost ten people with travel coffees standed at the start of the seat," says Wernstein's Citizen Meister Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to go to Pasau.
However, because Germany was surprising the train traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee stroke, it was for them in Wernstein concluses," said the Stadler, who immediately offered his help, and swimming along with two other helpers and their cars over the borders in Nae Passau.
Before we have destroyed the unexpected guests once, with jause and drinks.
We just said we'll bring them to Pasau with the car.
"This was self-conscious for us," says the stadler in the OÖN conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man didn't take it to deliver a great spend - 100 euros for fire shooting.
"This has been very pleased to us," so the Stadler.
On Sunday, the trained passengers were turned into a regional direction by a ICE towards Pasau in order to try to spend on the short-term proclamation that the rail transport was established to Germany, but still through the border.
However, before the borders in Wernstein, the regional department was entered.
In Wernstein, the cross-border border is generally high in the course.
The Bridge Festival linked to the Bayern neighbors on Sunday, the day before a double bridge is sportive - organized by the Warnstein Union and the Bayern from New Church.
That Victor Orbán now sends to us other thousands of cigs, is a logical result of a likely policy:
Instead of helping in the region of Röszke immediately in the establishment of structures to ensure humanity, our Federal Officer has emphasized the position of the Hungary government in the dark circle of nationalism.
The suffering of this policy is not only the Austrians who are now faced in the border areas with chaotic circumstances.
The refugees must also find that the "good country" which they have invited and welcomed is nothing as another refugee stock.
It will be a great challenge, given the continuing refugee streams and the near winter, to create human conditions for demanders for protection.
And there will be more - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad on the search for 35.000 winter feasts
Konrad has to do all the hands with the refugee submission.
Christian Conrad is used that his word has weight.
The government has used the previous powerful rail bank to establish quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The Chaos in the first rescue centre of Traiskirchen has already been obtained in the griff.
"We don't have no objection anymore in Traiskirchen," he reported about his first success.
The submission of the 20,000 refugees who arrived to Austria on Monday has also been pursued without a large cluster, Konrad said and loving the organizational "Master Service".
However, the Ministry of Internal Affairs was a "Crising situation".
Conrad totally calculated with a need of 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to fill the number, the next weeks must be found more than 35,000 accommodations - 20,000 countries have to provide the countries, 15,000 of the covenant.
If it becomes more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's no fass without land," Konrad said.
He has already discussed with the head of the country.
They would have assigned him to create quarters for the coming refugee.
"In Obersterreich it works good," said Ferry Mayer.
The former VP Mandator supports Konrad.
Tomorrow it will be given a meeting with Kardinal Christoph Schönborn, which will be explained how the Church will help.
The Asylum coordinator also sets the ORF action "Help as we".
On the platform, private persons can offer incomplete accommodations.
Moreover, you're hoped of hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Mayer criticized last night the standards for sublime were "very high".
In times, it could not be possible that the quarter provider should keep a certain height of the handle holder or size of the surface lights.
"Notstandards" should be applied for a period of time.
In contrast to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Konrad is based on his experience.
I am an older man who is not saying inconservence without any other face.
Convince power is his most important weapons.
Conrad and Mayer did not cause costs, as they themselves declared.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
The own quarter search has not been successful.
Konrad wanted to set a container on the Stephans place as a office.
There are, however, problems with approval.
Linz requires a better department
First, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and design Center for the sublime of refugees plants the city Linz.
This is not necessary when the interests are now able to be taken without these measures, Master Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, further positions should be examined on their validity.
The head of the city is critical to the department of refugees within the Federal State.
Other areas must also contribute here.
Sea horses: "The vegetables are not cut off"
In a long term of phone with Mr Horst Seehofer (CSU) Mr Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday, the country has agreed the further action in the refugee question.
Seahofer has assured me that the German borders are not disrupted.
The continued travel of refugees to the Federal Republic is possible.
However, it is now the relevant border controls.
Special journeys with refugees to Germany will first not give it.
However, protective demanders would be sent to Germany with regular trends.
The other Member States of the EU requested a more strengthened solidarity in the demand of refugee.
What Austria also has under control at its borders, is "a logical consequence" from the action of the Germans.
The next routine is a question of time
The generalization of the "New World" in Linzer Industry Linzer is officially closed.
In four of the six Stockworks of the office and production building, the officially notified IT concerts S&T, the remainder (2700 quatermeters) is to prevent young and innovative enterprises from the technology area.
"In the IT, the sweet heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine to invest in new trade companies and later acquiring any.
Until starting, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors, where the Niederhauser says: "The next runtastic is just a question of time".
1.7 million euros were invested in the location by S&T, 3,3 million euro from the Techcenter, which belongs to a third of the city Linz, the country of S&T and the bond (FFG).
The building is packed by the Linz AG for 60 years at S&T and Techcenters.
30% of the 2700 square meters rest in the building have already been avoided, for more than 40% requests.

It was expressed to the decision that the Fula producers who were home in Bologna were the idea of a own location where only their handbags were sold.
"We are the only ones in the big room Linz that sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who owned Italian roots.
Their mode interest has received width from her mother in the way.
I am mostly grateful if something is developed and I can show new tendencies to be able.
Why some women have such a beautiful handtaking device when seeing a sweet taste, the expert woman can not respond with the last security.
Maybe it's a beautiful taste of each outfit.
The brull-seeker from the city of Kall
The Pfällers of Donald Trump came from a place where the inhabitants were called.
This property also links some to the billion who wants to be the President of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for the trainer.
If he expresses himself foreignly, the journalists are ridicule or reveals knowledge in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the United States Chairman's Chairman is strongly engaged in the election campaign.
And smell it well.
This is also registered in the Palestinian Kallstadt where the biggest households of the real estate billion.
The New Yorker with the hot flight is a sense of many in the winter village on the winter street.
Some in the 1200-resident part of the area are over -10 ecks with him.
His grandfather came from Kall City in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the campaign mode.
The Kalltown Simone Wendel turned a movie over the Trump.
And what do the villages think about his goal to become the most powerful man of the world?
"I think they find it somewhat smiling, but they're not even impressed as much as much as possible," says Simone Wendel.
The coal city has turned a fascinated documentark over the place and its famous spotslings, with which also the Ketchup family Heinz is in the side of the trump.
Trump, who is not known for awareness, comes in "Kings of Call City" (2014) as well as in words - so that he would be sure that he would also be successful if he lives in the city of Call.
He didn't bring it there to the king of the heart.
Although it respects the performance of the family, but also tenderly the view that the Trump is "sweet a little a big moul", Wendel says.
On the other hand, the name of the sculpture has the city in the circle, "The brulljemaker" - to high-depth: the shop, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the supplier.
Trump's success history began in 1885, when the later grandfathers moved out and opened a place for gold manufacturers in the United States.
Basestein of the real estate center were the first baseball purchase in New York.
But the life of the grandfathers was not free of tragic: their desire to return to the home, ruined in the Birth State where the philosophy was then belonging.
He didn't include Trump because he was first without approval, the director of the Institute for Palestinian History and Population, Roland Paul, declared to the film start.
Trump is the only one of the "illicy immigrants".
This is in contrast with the marked words of the follow-up.
He had repeatedly spoken about mexican immigrants in the United States and requested the construction of a border march to decrease illegal immigrants.
"Come the polter, it's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a far-related trumpet ("The Oma was a birth Trump, the opa was born Heinz").
The winter in peace looks more distanced to the Americans, "he is always so shocking."
Does he think that the trump is coming?
"I can't imagine this," the 72-year-old boys says.
"He never cares about the city of Karl."
The Pension Waltin Veronika Schramm mentioned as some Kilstadders that a postcomme of the Heinz family at a visit was something to the church rule, which was generally good.
"I can't imagine it from Donald," the 68-year-old boys says.
She starts better if he doesn't win the choice, because "he has such radical views, I don't know whether that's good."
If those who had the sake at the time of his grandfathers in the United States would have been like he, "If he would never come there."
"There's more interesting topics than him," says Winzertood Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My President isn't right," she says.
And: "The trumpets will also be reif without the President."
Whondels film, which has been interviewed for the trumpet long, has seen 12 000 films, also expected the interest in the United States.
The Oberbayer community Ramsau at Bertensgaden is the first "Bergestigerdorf".
From the hand of the Vice-President at the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherfenig, the 1800-hisper-four in the National Park has received the appointment of Sanften Tourism at midnight.
In Austria there are already 20 "Burggencies" people.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpen Agreement is responsible for the allocation.
A "Regger village" may have at least 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its surface must be identified as a protective area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the evaluations, despite the trials of Nine, to take the loss of leadership at today's show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson yesterday to Canberra to report to the loss of the Liberal leadership, but it had no major movements in the evaluations for today.
The breakfast show of Nine was extracted by the Federal Headquarter, when Malcolm Turnbull created the storm of Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, took place in London as a part of a convenient series of international television events, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This part of the distance seemed not to play a role for Australian TV showers, since Sunrise averaged 397.000 observers at the five main cities, compared with today 339.000.
Today, a slight increase in the ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283.000), but his number remained behind the last Sunday (343.000).
Today, in the last few months, the laugh closed to Sunrise.
Today, in August, the average of 318.000 was reached in comparison with the 330,000 Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Since September, Sunrise is a average of 349.000 viewers at 314.000 today.
This is the most interesting thing happens every morning.
The wind of the walls relates to these mornings more than the Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are okay, thank you for the review!
Written by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series Star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently dismissed father, who decided to leave with his two children at the Coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
The critics asked whether Thomson could take a Hit Show Solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "Yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers, and it was easy for the Block (838.000) and TBL families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results on the night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 - 17.30) of the new Quiz show, modernized by Andrew O'Keefe, was a average of 446.000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) spent on 623.000 viewers - enough for a small victory about Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613.000).
On Monday, the first half hours of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 viewers, and 720,000 were in the second half hours.
Hot-Seat averages 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of the second night of The Chase Australia will certainly vote that Hot Seat will be last at 17:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for millions of dollars minutes that didn't make it possible to flee the McGuires show.

The last three votes agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret enthusiasmed? ...
Lana Jeez-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snesana Markoski may have clearly obvious who wins the Bachelor.
The woman, who finally entered Sam Wood in The Bachelor, was in the biggest secret.
And no of the three remaining girls will certainly be worth not if she is the one who received the last Rose.
But when we are with Sarah Mackay, Snesana Markoski and Lana Jeez-Fellows on the day before three, checked, you may have given a reference to who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips to final on Thursday
All three women have been lyriced about the reason why the wood of the perfect man is and called his sense for humor, honor, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be a partner.
However, if the question is questioned "If you don't have to get Woods' last Rose?", they might be their answers to the player, who wins the heart of the bachelor.
Jebes-Fellows and Markoski called both fast - except yourself - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship since the first day.
"When I went to the house and noted (Sarah) and Sam's energy, I felt that they were very complicated, and I thought it all over the show," said Jeij-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with two feet on the earth, it makes it so fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw her together, and they've got the right chemistry.
They feel awesome and comfortable ones.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would have been a good couple.
From her view, Mackay said that the house visit made her clear that Wood "The One" could be.
"When I saw him with my friends and the family, I was clear that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unforgettable on him," she said.
And when she was asked, whose wood had to choose, if not her, she was worthy.
"I don't know if I can tell it," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's an unfair difference between Snesana and Lana.
The Bachelor is extracted at midnight at 19:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest when he moved to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressed open training day end of the last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula and looked like a good decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a ring as it did the exsie Rugby Liga converging at his first bridge return on Tuesday 20-3 winning against Minesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to retreat and also in the walking game after a injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his real face in the upkleide cabin after the game.
Instead of making his smokes before the rest of the team through the pool, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.

Jarryd Hayne is paved at a point that was rebuilt in the first playshop by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start of the Hayne and its massive Australian follow-up for his NFL debtion.
Hayne left the game field and later told the Australian Duo Hamish & Andy Radio on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine no worse start in his NFL carriage,
"This was a thing that comes before now, you're only careful about the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the sniper with its original Debüt in 2007 when a passage in its own in-goal area led to a trial for Queensland.
However, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne was placed for a photo with fans and holded an Australian fleet after the game and posted it on his instagram.

NHC says 60% opportunities for cyclon south of the Capverd Islands
The US National Hurricane Center, on Tuesday, predicted a wide pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the Southern Cape Tower Islands, which has a 60% opportunity to develop in the next 48 hours a tropical mosque tower.
Another significantly defined deep pressure system, almost in the middle of the Capverd Islands and the small antilles, also has a 60% potential to build a tropical skin tour in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts double-up campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a duplication campaign to bring $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have crossed the European nations because they run out of the war and fled from the armed countries.
Google has an insufficient personal approach to the announcement of the spending call on his blog.
Instead of allowing an advertising to a manager, Rita Masoud, a Google employer fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about their personal experiences.
"Their travels belonged to many dark trains and buses, also hungry, dust, smell and fear," she wrote.
I was happy.
But since the crisis of refugee and migration has grown in Europe, many of them are looking for help as my family.
The costs are available to four common organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global collected costs are doubled up to a value of 5,5 million on google.com/refugee delivery to 11 million dollars.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, widely caused by the four-year-old civil war in Syria, which has passed over 4 million people this year.
Many refugees also from Afghan, Jemen, Iraq and Libyan destroyed by the war.
Report of Yasmeen Abutaleb; processing by Christian Plumb
For easy overwhelming diabetes, weight loss may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for easy overwhelming persons with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study.
It's still too early to say whether overwhelming people with diabetes after weight loss of weight live longer than those who receive non-chirurgy treatment.
"Death data needs a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a expert of weight loss surgery, who wrote a guide to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or Adiposite surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the magens.
They reduce hungers and limit the physical ability to include food.
Over the years, Adipostas operations have been effectively treated with type-2 diabetes, but most studies have been performed in people who are sickly fettleby with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in respect of size, shall apply as normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overwhelming, and people with a SME more than 30 are more than fettleby.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital data collected in a study since 2007 and compared two types of Adiposita-Chirurgie - Magenbypass and Magen-TV - to medical treatments for type-2 diabetes in persons who were easily overwhelming.
The average MMEs understood by this operation are closed from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
However, IMO remained at those who had been treating non-chirurgical diabetes at about 29 years.
Between those who have undergone a surgical invasion, 36% the diabetes disease was completely resolved and 28% was partly.
In the medical-related group, in comparison with diabetes, only one percent and in part only two percent.
Furthermore, the results in controlling blood pressure, triglyceride and LDL chollentine were better in general in the 'chirurgical' group, found the authors.
The researchers also observed the patients' blue level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar in the course of time.
Hemoglobin A1c is mainly maintained under 7%, write the researchers.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c level was around 9% to around 6%.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stable at about 8%.
But this better "glychemic control" - as you reflect in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, so the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares the average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass Cyrurgy Group had lost more weight in comparison with the Gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), there was increased decline in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 % vs. 2,1 %) and recorded mostly a complete transmission of diabetes (46.9 % vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not demonstrate the benefit of the surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more serious people in Sweden that the operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, University of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, there were fettleibites who undermined a adiposite operation, about 29% less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show advantages for survival at the surgery patients, Blackstone said that it is calm for people with a MMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study, because she says that this operation is lower than this BMI group," she said, "without increased risk of death or renal disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking serious weight when the patient was with its MMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that when they have collected these genetic changes that have set up their body with fertility and diabetes, it is very difficult."
Love history plays in the pocket
It is a theme that is now confused in the Belletristic: a young woman, in school times, is unpleasant and unlikely, returns to the black of her youth after years, and it is loved in her.
Similarly, in the recently appeared Roman "We are not so" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love stories, the Roman would be especially interesting for Hunspresser readers, because he plays in long-term and surrounding regions.
The primary professional author has grown in Langwier and is pleased to make a literary thinking at home.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not take all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East was the real solution.
The Tibeth-Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the home countries of refugee.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the sustained refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visits in the United Kingdom in his speech, following the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is ethic studies.
It requested that the interests of humanity should be made under the circumstances given to the interests of the individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis, but the situation was not appropriate.
"It's impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his word.
Although the Dalai Lama and Austria's efforts were glorified to address the crisis, he stressed that it was just a timely solution.
"Set to care for several thousands of refugees, it is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, such as peace and real development, mainly through education, to be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we must consider how the murder is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and also commented George Bush's trade after the terrorism attack on 11 September and pointed out that the violent response of the United States was a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 11 September, I expressed my complaint in a letter to President Bush, and I said to him that the way to solve this problem is in violence.
"I know his reasons were good, but he put violence, and it called unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four times increased in receipt of handdededetect infections by children in the past 4 years
In the U.S., there is a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of alcoholic defects, so Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of Georgia Poison Center, the cases of receipt of hand-de-infected infections in children under 12 years were reported to the guest control centres from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Childs are always more often at these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them goes in the emergency record," said Lopez CNN.
He said some children drinking desinfects, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a brave test in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young desinfects are only drinking because of a valuable experience.
Young people have usedly mixed desinfects with alcoholic waters to get a worse drink.
Younger children can be closed by attractive skins of desinfects.
"A child does not think that's bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (Hand-Desinfects) are those who are completed.
There are desinfects with earthquake, vineyards and persons that are very suitable for children.
Handdededecimal infection contains some between 45 and 95% of alcohol.
Especially in small children, few spliters can lead to alcohol verglation.
"It's the highest concentrationd alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, Medical Director of the Gatephone Center in the hospital house of Kansas, Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let the whisky smile, but people let this hand desinfect in the range of children, and when children come to it, then it's a fast opportunity to consume much alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-year-old girl who had recently taken four spliters from the earthquake infringements in the school, was taken into an emergency record.
Your blood coal concentration was 179, twice higher than the weight that applies legally to adults, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an insurance art which treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed her words and was not able to go when she came to the ambulance.
The doctors watched them at night in a separate child hospital on signs of the Hirn-Teloa, since the girl was shocked by the alcohol and shooted the head, said Ritchey.
"This was very shocking," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, CNN.
It could be dead for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol free products or desinfects and low hand-de-de-infection infections outside the root of the child.
Furthermore, some desinfects were associated with death accidents.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after the shock of hand-de-de-infected infections that received a toxic, undeclared addiction.
Workers of health authorities estimated that the product was methanol, a mortal solution, instead of Ethilal coal, noted as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to settle their "common" teacher by expressing antibacterial products around the education room,” reports a police report.
The teacher is very allergic towards the dedetect infections of the hands and escaped it out of their room.
The police considered the plan referred to as "conciliation" and disciplinary measures to the school authority.

The Boer, who is currently a messager for Ajax, said, "In Holland they do not show highlights of the Celltic games anymore and why?"
It's because the ringers aren't there.
People are not only talking about the back of the rangers.
You're talking about the old company.
They're talking together about both teams and that's what she's interesting.
There is a lot of fun in the old-friend games, and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games.

Why I will be witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Sometimes today, except at a late legal intervention, I will see how a man will die.
If it happens, and I hope that it doesn't happen, I'll sit in an observer gallery in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by the gift spots.
He asked me to be one of the four official Witnesses at his death.
The invitation has already been the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I was right.
When the day was nearer, I began to fear me.
So why should I do it?
I was right because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about death penalties.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see in the United States, and as more demands are available than places, there is a worse lottery in place to decide who is selected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, it will be observed without emotiveness.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossips a close friend with whom I developed my own relationship in the course of months with telephones and a two and a half hours of visit.
I like the guy.
We're laughing many times when we talk.
The prison officials say that I can't be a witness and a journalist, so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a stipulate to write what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to abandon my inpartiality.
This is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants, and you get access.
I'll be grateful with her.
She emphasized that she "he could make it better", but she still thinks that it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and written.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would do it.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of Witnesses every time.
But he wants a international reporter to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public work of movement against death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of Podcasts I've done.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say with safe that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His acts after murdering Barry Van Treese would make him guilty to be a beneficiary of the fact.
But I think there is a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I believe there is no sufficient evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his instruction is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll see him to die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
It will be given to other reporters to which you can apply.
What you're going to get from me is what it means to see a man died unnecessary.
Man after fired police persecution year to come from the Canning River
The Canning Vale Police was shocked when he killed the man from the Canning River.
A man of Perth who tried to defeat the police was followed when he found himself in the stage and summoned water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "to overcome him to get back to the ice."
The police of Canning Vale was called in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they found the suspect, they tried to get out of them in the direction of Canning River.
But he came not too far.
"He stood in the water- and said, 'I don't come out, come and get to me," said senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not yet encouraged to make his unit, so he went to a more reliable tactic - "A good police negotiates".
"Atimes people do so to try to get out", said senior sergeant Castledine.
Masterschafts-football player Ben Cousins offers an uncommon example.
In 2006, Cousins entered his car in the grain to run a alcohol control and then tried to swim through the Swan River.
His efforts were followed, but inspired homelands to the humored planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody states that Stewards tried to spontaneize him and threaten to end the rent sport
Peter Moody said that Stewards tried to install a spion in his surfaces last year and threatened to end the rain immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the integrity Department of Racing Victoria, and said that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the late Scratching of Lady Tatai because of a rentages treatment, the last strohhalm on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the rear sport and he himself considered himself in difficult conditions when it went to the positive cobalt tuffer test at Lidaris that he cannot explain.
He had been left for 18 months because of the shooting front and didn't want it to "shore like too high lighting traubs".
"I had planned to say nothing about it, and I've seen it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out again," said Moody.
You know that it's continued.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I would like to spend the higher head, and I want my owners to think I'm looking for my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't do that, I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
I have to figure out what I'm doing with my license.
Moody had made the bomb up in an interview with racing.com that the integration department had tried to sponsorize its steel.
"For eight months Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I will be appointed when I was asked - and offered him a job in my surfaces to provide information about what I do inside my surface," said Moody on Racing.com.
You're obviously thinking I'm a fraud.
If this is the case, they should certainly be shocked on their nest because they tried to take me.
Robert Roulston, eye. President of the RVL, David Moodie, director of RVL and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of the RVL, was aware of it at the time and are still today.
Should I think that it would be personal?
Have the RVL been firm and maybe people are responsible for what works in the industry?
I'm bad for the industry?
Are I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people think that I'm out there.
Maybe they're gonna have to take my license and hide me, and I don't doubt that what I'm saying, they're gonna think about it now.
But I'm at the point where I don't know, and this makes me angry.
This makes me really awesome.
I will exercise the pressure on them and strike them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family, and I can go.
The scratching level of the trainer was built with the long-term Kobalt interview at Lidari, and the late scratching led to saying that he could "shoot his license over the table."
Moody, the best known by his preparation of the unlawful Black Caviar Master, described the Renning Days Training Rule "speakly", after a packaging or sound was taken on the horses, which was made against the rules.
"It is against the rules of the rear sport.
I have to take the full responsibility for it," he said.
"Another of my employee has struck on the skin.
It could be like that last night.
It could be like the whole day yesterday.
But it was like that at the breakfast.
Moody could be compared with a three-month disqualization for the packing treatment on the reception day.
It's a wrath.
People who set these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you've been too far," said Moody.
Man after driver flight arrested
The police was arrested by a man after a shock with a rail driver and then driver flight in Cobram.
The rail driver was sent to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was taken from a car on the Murray Valley's car on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver went on without stop to help the last driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from the police in Shepparton was a police man from Nathalia.
It is expected that it is accused of driving and delayed help and for other transport crimes.
The Rad driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital and is in a stable condition.
Melbourne-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy urges rivales because of arrests against ring fighters
Melbourne-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has called the "Agenda-Setting" of two First League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the Scheeds Directors have allowed the Storm players "Ring battle" with his team during the high storm seat in the qualification final in Sydney on Friday.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made an uncomfortable note to the Storm Team after his management had reached the final seat against North Queensland Cowboys at the afternoon. He called the game "Shooter game" of Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland would not be "be good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the tack limit of his manity and said that she was only concentrated on her "contact".
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers agreed to him on his manity, since it claimed that they were worried to be shocked by the Storm team.
"This always looks out again - I didn't hear that Trent Robinson talked about the ring battle when they kicked us 242," said Bellamy on midnight.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything to our defensive system or techniques throughout the year. But in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles to a real point, and that has produced the trend for us.
Trent is now there for three years, and obviously he has a great manner to train. So he is probably not intended to lose it, so it was a little shock for him.
It's very cute as this happens back to this year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of the "smiling football" and reminds his mentor that Bennett St George Illawarra Dragons wins the First League in 2010 with "lang-feet" football.
Wayne speaks of slight football.
He compared his game at the afternoon with our Friday and how exciting it was her game," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized as a late team, and Wayne said he would take care of him.
But now he has a team that can play and that we look slightly, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players.
He did this speech in 2010, now he wants to play all his types of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I'm creating stronger confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried to play against us.
6 weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game storm against Roosters had a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of Broncos was probably a good game, I didn't see it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two further trials in our game, but is this a great game?
Or are pauss made and no points of shocking?
It's the game plans for me.
If they're thinking of us, it means that we're still going to meet them in a stage.
The Storm team has the right to receive the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronule Sharks on the next afternoon in the AAMI Park. The ticket sale starts from the next service morning.
Serbia with $200,000 kitchen by drug accused
A man who might threaten a long-term punishment because of his attempt to come in the ownership of 40 kg of cocaine that was shocked after Queensland has been released against a cup of $200,000.
Marko Maximvid, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police was found on the Yacht Solay, which came from South America about Vanuatu and engaged in Coomera in August.
Massimovic was observed how he found his mixed complaints in the Jacht harbor during the Sunday and later at the coffee Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 pounds of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of a long-term punishment to have a commercial quantity of cocaine, the lawyer of Macmosvic argued that it was not evidence that he tried to have the whole amount and that the coffee could have been a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was worried about the flight drive at Maximov.
He has clear relationships with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often,” he explained the Court on midnight.
In the crime case, he lied the police about his residence.
Massimovic's mother and Stiefpaters offered a cost of $200,000 together as a security to reach its release.
"After reading of the disadvantaged statements of the two persons, it is clear that the establishment of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden", said the judge Flanagan.
But this will not be enough to stop it, not appearing, he warned.
Maximvic was released against cupation, under the conditions that he departs his Australian and Serbian pass, reports to the police every day and takes himself to a starting stage of 18:00-06:00.
Unfall at A5 at Karls Ruhe: Leader House travels out of each other
In a car three car car car at Karls Ruhe, a vehicle vehicle has been hardly injured at the service date.
Two of the three cars involved were broken before a long building in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noted it too late and tried to exhibit the left in the last moment as the police reported.

Stevan Hogg used phones of girls to spend paedophiles to ship pictures
A paedophyler used the phone for a 11-year-old girl to request images of child-use.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl when he was sleeping in a online messenger service, from which he received a number of unreasonable pictures from children sent to him by another user.
The girl waited later and found that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She saw it, found the confused messages and alarmed her mother immediately.
The police was careful about this and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "acceptable" web research, using the definitions for searching for inadequate images of children.
Hogg then said to the officers that he had done it because it would lead to "padophile on the Internet" and then he "predicted to be a police to fear it."
The lawyer Eilidh Robertson said to the Dumble Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a search that he was sweet to fear people.
He told him that the search was carried out on his computer, but he said that it happened because he wanted to be a policeman to fear Padophile.
He was asked after his conversation with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to save her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drinks, and he wanted to see pictures of robbery and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "If the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the sitter and wine.
She also saw the inconsistent pictures on the phone and faced the accused of it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and play station used to talk to the girls who were much younger than he.
Hogg, 23. Ward Road, Dundee, declared in the sense of the appeal to have included unrelated pictures of children on the 14 June last year, to disfellowship on 25 January this year and not to be a court's hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to appear in the registry of sexual criminals, since it could be argued that "no significant sexual elements" are in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael dismissed the sentence until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted in this case, but because of hearing to other cases that still exist, it was held in investigation.
It was included in the register of sexual criminals before the date of the judgment.

The massa's: Every two years the autobuilders show their news on the IAA.
2015 is mainly to compare the movement in the compact car that is currently specially sell.
Currently, cars from the compact class are particularly asked: Rund 28.1% of the new permits are disrupted according to the motor vehicle unit (KBA) alone in August on this segment.
This reflects also on the IAA (Publicity Day 17 to 27 September).
Among all future concept vehicles and new super-class and luxury cars are presented in this year, especially many new compact models.
One of the greatest premiums for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the beginning of the handlers.
"The Astra is a very important model for us," said Opel Chief Karl-Thomas Newmann on the Messe.
He belongs to the brand nuclear.
In order to sell the volume model also, the new Astra should not also be cut off.
Opel makes an increase under the largest competitive VW Golf, starting at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra has a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
Furthermore, the hessen offers additional cellal and benzine engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, to which the first time the threecylinder bends are counted.
Instead of the main competitive VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only five-towers.
The second variant will be followed in the early year of the combine, which is already seen in the IAA.
And what will happen next to the Astra on the IAA to new compacts?
Renault Megane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra concurrent megan to the pension.
On the messe, the Megan is only seen as five doors in a conventional and a substantial sporting GT version.
In the trade, he comes to the beginning of the next year, then as Combi.

The Nissan award wants to find his position in the strong growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti is fully entered into the design lines of the brand.

In the offer, however, a chain is also 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.

JVA Berlin tab: Fifth squaremeter cells are inhuman
The Federal Constitution Court has given the right to a former prisoner of the Judiciary of Tagel, which has been undertaken in a too small cell for months.
In view of the infringement of their human affairs, prisoners have basically a right to financial deterioration when they have been subjected to small cells.
This has decided the Constitution Court in a decision published at mid-day.
The applicants may even hope money if they were limited only a few days in the closed spaces (Article 1: 1 BvR 1127/14).
In this way, a former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe succeeded: he was in the Berlin Headquarter of June to November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of the ground; the toilet was not spacely disappeared.
Then the man who, according to his lawyer, was re-freely in a larger cell again.
His official detention declared against the country of Berlin as a result of the unfair imprisonment.
However, the Constitutional Directors took up the judgment of the Chambergericht Berlin and returned to the case for the renewed test.
You see the human belief of the man.
Cammergericht now decides on the height of deterioration
Even if, for legal reasons of the questionnaire period, only a few days of prison for the deprivation, it is a compensation right, said it.
On the other hand, "the sales of the legal protection of personality would be feared."
The chambergericht must now clarify the amount of money damage.
The Constitutional Directors have already strengthened the rights of criminal prisoners in the past.
Thus, in April, they just said to have a defect injury because he was locked in a cell.
Inhumanity is also a decision of 2011 the multi-specificisation of a cell without separate toilet.
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitution Court on the midday afternoon that a prisoner in a parallel accident in November 2009 had shown an unreasonable income.
The current applicant was undertaken over three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the case of Karlsruher.
The Berlin prisons have also been in charge of lack of personnel in the last few weeks.
The prisoners are therefore always enclosed in 23 hours, increased aggressiveness, even on slaughterers, and it must have been already done because of the shocked situation.
After the judicial press office, 21 places are not placed in Tegel because of lack of injury, 19 should be deleted in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We make it"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the federal government has decided to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
800 000 asylum applicants will come to Germany this year after prognoses of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs, according to Vizecanzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to include a million refugees.
The federal blogger Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated inconsistent challenge: "I say again and again: we can create it, and we do it."
What happens to Germany, the following overview is referred to.
According to different prognoses, between 350000 (stimation of the Federal Development Ministry) and 400000 (stimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - even for the next five years.
This is almost double as far as it is built (250000 apartments).
Dramatically, however, the lack of living space is mainly in payable meals: the yearly 60000 to 80000 social accommodations fall from the meal price connection, and these special favorable apartments will also require refugees.
For this reason, the Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the promotion, from now to a million of EUR 518 million.
Many too few of the Pestel Institute has been viewed: 800,000 social accommodations have to occur annually, and this should be a promotion of 6.4 billion per year.
Some of the scientists and federal department are that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in the construction of households.
According to estimates of the Institute for Labour Market and Professional Research, 55% of the refugees in Germany can be acquired in a long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked after their qualification to help them at the ingress, criticize Claudia Walter, Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, for the integration of refugees, it is crucial to find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for assessment in the acquiring society, but also for the self-value of migrants, Migration researcher Dietrich Thrnhardt says.
In Germany, Trinhardt has given it a political course: the ban for refugees to recognise work.
While it was previously banned for asylum applicants for up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the resident liability that the asylum applicant limits to a residence place.
In the society, as well as because of the expert fault, most of the view that refugees should be allowed to access to the labour market.
A great deal for the access to the labour market is lacking German knowledge.
There is no sufficient offer for general and professional courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often shared by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore viewed by Trinhardt the king's way to work integration.
The Berlin School Manager has found that only few refugeed parents give their children to the work, estimatedly 10 to 15 percent: "It is only very important to keep the family together", says Ilja Koschembar, speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Management.
However, to convince the family of the advantages of us, the management of hands is distributed in different languages.
If there is a strong increase in the need for scientists through the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity - for example by allowing more educational schools.
In the countries, students are prepared for training in the German classes without knowledge.
However, they are not always taught by full-educated teachers and teachers, but also, as in Berlin, of teacher forces who have only a qualification in German as second language.
There is no fault to them, Beate Stoffs say by the Berlin School Management.
The German student work estimates that some 20% of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no Federal Asylum applicants or pacientes have been understood the study - the only exception was until Berlin, the internal senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now set its position.
Students voluntary refugees could be facilitated access to high school.
Because refugees with a residence or duty do not receive performance after the asylum application law when they start a study.
The latters are not obtained in the basis of their bathroom, as they do not fall under the circle of the baptized persons.
Paved refugees had to live up to four years in Germany to be entitled to be Bafög, from 1 January 2016 to 15 months of slowing this spane.
However, this financing must also be closed, requested by Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science and the German student work.
The students should get bafög immediately.
The Islam will play a more important role in the future, since many refugees are Muslims, and for many the religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should subsequently put the Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and further develop the existing State-Circ law into a new relationship with state religions.
It would also be important for the creation of a Islamic well-being association which is professionally careful for the new conventions.
The rights are also responsibilities.
Thus, the representatives of the Islam must be ready to work with the State in many areas and make certain control opportunities.
This is also the disposal of being protected against religious fundamentalism.
The President of the Muslim Central Council, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts could also be joined in Germany on Thursday.
Those who wanted to execute such conflicts in Germany "he had immediately their right to pursue here, in Germany," he said in the Bahrian Rundfunk.
He proposed to translate the basic law to the Arabian.
Integration will be more than today a subject of the whole society.
In order to change the majority of society, the reduction of discrimination and racism will also be increased.
However, Germany has, as a result of European decisions, has been a anti-discrimination body and a general equality law since a few decades.
But it learns very slowly how the NSU murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motivation.
Similar opportunities for all: that migratory organizations and the groups of non-profit Germans have already requested and to undertake international agreements like the Anti-Russism Convention in the coming years must be reality if the country remains peacefully and its new citizens and citizens should use their possibilities for all.
Generally, Germany has been able to give medically expected refugees, says President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"What man powers and capacity are we doing this," he said to the day level.
However, additional money should be flown into the system.
To avoid enthusiasming, Montgomery calls for the same access to all competitors to the registration of health cards.
Exercised benefits could be calculated later with the federal countries.
And long-termly it should be most fragile to consider so many people with the limited performance catalogue prescribed by the Asylum application law.
Instead, the doctors make the language barriers primarily.
Until now, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has indicated that migrants are more devastated about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, even in doctoral practices, dolmetsher costs should be administered.
However, many refugees would also be helped with more general medical routines in emergency ammunition.
And with another diagnostic view.
Under refugees, it is almost clearly more untrained disorders, and in the youth, it is about HIV explanation.
With the other illness images, German doctors come from their training clearly, says Montgomery.
"It isn't so hard to recognise the illness of the physicians."It is possible by the refugees to even relief.
The Syrians had a high-scale education system, some refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to practice, they should be able to demonstrate their qualifications and, if possible, delay tests.
At least half of the refugees arrived in Germany, according to estimates of the federal psychotherapeuten chamber (BPtK) is psychologically sick: most of them suffered by posttraumatic load disorder or depression.
In particular, the refugee skipper, Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study of TU Munchen pointed out that every fifth Syrian refugee kid is traumated in Germany.
Those who are ill to posttraumatic loading disorders, among others are so-called Flashbacks with respiratory, skin, heart race and death paintings.
Additional symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, strong horribleness and emotiveness.
To prevent the chronic symptoms, if necessary for early treatment, Munz declared.
However, only four per cent of the psychologically sick refugees receive a psychotherapy.
Although psychologically sick asylum requesters can make a request for a psychotherapy, the treatment is almost a few months.
Furthermore, in social employees, most experts or doctors who are not trained for psychological diseases would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to lack of assessments, says Munz.
Manege calls for dreams
With the new "Leidence" insertion, the Circus Probst returns to the traditions of the circumcision art.
The aim is to move every age group into the banks of fascinating acrobatics, animal clothes and individual Entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst enters the hands on the hill to dream.
"Our suffering is the circus."
"I can't imagine without living my circumcision family," said Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and Juniorchefin.
"Leidence" - under this engine is the current manipulation.
For more than 33 years the circus is in the hands of the family Probst.
So the family is in the blood.
"We are important to get people out of their daily trail and to take them into a entirely different world for two hours," stressed the 27-year-old Juniorchefin.
"Manegencocktail with World City Flair", says Director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the round of about 3,000 km long tours can now experience this fleet.
The circus program is convinced with talented artists from the world.
The Russian Stoliarov Clown Family is located at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the public with witz and charme in their banks.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their handwork.
With the heroes of the stomach films, it wants to take the Cuban Duo locker.
Facility and movement - they are identified with these words.
Your humorous art on the mast will be able to stir the women's heroes in the storm.
Unlike many lachsalves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with finger pepper feelings and flexibility.
Ballar with the random on a ball?
There's no problem for He Yuan.
Fascinating and fearing smells.
Wang Lin from China, with the oldest form of the acrobatics, is like little other and fascinated with its movement.
60 employees from twelve nations offered diversity in each regard.
"The animals belong to our family," Stephanie Mother, Brigitte Provst.
Disorders in the situation of circumcises are often subjects in various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also believes: "If our animals are not good, it's not good to us."
round 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each strike unit.
The "treeping artists" as it is called lovely, every desire will be read from the eyes, if possible.
We want to work together with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't smell, it doesn't want to be in the hands.
So the top command is good to care for the animals.
Specifically on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture from a ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebrastote, the family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a walk and nothing happened.
"There was our little Jumbo there," says Brigitte Probst.
The cebroid is not yet ready for the manner, but it is the unique mask of the Circus Probst.
So for each visitor, it should be something there.
" One is safe," said Stephanie Probst, "we always give our best and are with all the hearts."
The Circus Probst takes place from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 p.m. to his ideas.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 and 16 p.m.
Thursday is Family Day, for the presentation at 17 a.m. the prices are reduced.
In addition, daily the animal view is open from 10 to 18 hours.
Simbabwes Robert Mugabe holds false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, the former African leader, started the year from a podium.
He remained unfaithful, but the video of the case quickly spread about social media.
The opening of the Parliament was also understood by appealing by Members of the opposition that they had received an anonymous death threats and that they were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's debate with Buh.
In the last month, they were slaughtered him and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the movement of democratic change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gone said that seven opposition-political SMS messages have received on their phones that they warned to destroy Mr. Mugabes conversation.
"The message comes from a number that is not shown, but she has the title 'Tod'," he said journalists after Mugabes speak.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament, and when it leaves the Parliament, its parliamentary immunity is not more effective.
The chairman said that the party conducted by Msvangirai was "inquired" about the dangers for the politicians.
Hewlett packard will be reduced to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and recovery efforts in the services of the company.
In this year, HP will be shared in two börsennotified companies and share the computer and printer business from its rapidly growing company hardware and its service business.
The expected plant rebuilding leads to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"This restructuring measures will allow a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, HP President and Chief Executive, which should lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger focused than it is HP today, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of business supporting companies at the transition to a new style of business", Whitman said.
As a own company, we are better set than ever before to satisfy the changed needs of our customers throughout the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been focused on more than 50 billion annual sum and "It will be on the preparation until now inadequate, integrated technologie solutions for companies", says a statement of the company.
It distributes a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University Hewlett and Dave Packard to create electronic facilities and called Pallo Alto Garage the "the birth place of the Silicon Valley".

FC Arsenal Capital Mikel Arteta says that teams are collected before the game against Dynamo Zagreb, behind the blessed Jack Wilshere
Wenger emphasized Wilshere that it's just September and if his reliability goes after plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will be safe to at least the next four games for England, and in view of his history, his participation in the next summer in Europe's mastership is still uncertain.
The great tribulation to this current problem is that Wilshere had strongly completed the last season after a separate shooting injury and then returned to his old slowness during the presidence.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a skin that didn't heal.
This is not greater.
This was just a accident.
It wasn't connected to his cups or with the injuries that he had before.
This may be true from pure medical view, but as Wenger also recognised, there is the risk of further injuries, even if a player tries to return to the middle of the season.
It also developed an unfortunate pattern.
The survey of Premier Injuries Ltd represents 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debout six years ago.
He also played only 65 by Arsenals 157 links in the last five game times.
The larger image for Arsenal is that they were one of the two First League Clubs, in six of eight playtimes since 2007/08, which have generated most of the days of persecution.
Wenger accepts the potential of a demon circle, but Arsenal believes that a improvement in the damage rate will continue during the last season.
"Atimes when you return from an injury, you have an accidental period, a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win the strength of the fighter," Wenger said.
Jack's enough to overcome it.
I hope his body is stabilized, I'm convinced that he's gonna do it and he'll go through a career of the way he wins.
Arsenal begins his Champions League season on midnight against Dinamo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on the next midday, and Wenger has a rotation within the team.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey are not going to Croatia, which means that Matthieu Debooky and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Subo Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and the players that it needs to give a small swimming stop," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is clear preferences to continue by group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing places with the greatest counter-efficacy effect in Europe.
Dynamo has also been shocked after 41 games after the "unacceptable" campaign was started in the last season.
The stadium was shocked on Thursday night by a earthquake, measured on the board 3.2.
This year was 10 in Zagreb.
Nevertheless, Arsenal believes that the teachings from the past season with the Champions League Captulation against Monaco and remained in the deep hope of leading the Agreement to its first European Population Triumph.
"These squad is immense," Wenger said.
It has never been shocked with Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other side, I am enough in business to be realistic.
We're honest, but we're not dreams.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar exhibitions in show is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up is now more doubtful than you have been, as self-mortals under young men at a 15-year-old hour.
In 2013, it was the most important death cause for men in the age of 20 to 45 in Britain, and there is three times more often in men than women.
In order to face the problem, the Against Living Miserably campaign announced 2015 as a year of the man's purpose to ask the culture of men to help if they need it.
friendship is the heart room in the fight to master this challenge.
A present study in more than 2.000 high school students with depressive symptoms observed that if the sufferer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with "sufficed stimulation", his chances were doubled on genesis.
For those who are not depressive, half a circle of spiritually healthy friends is the risk of mental problems.
But, of course, you need to have friends only so that friendship can work.
In the age of the social media communication, with its main point on substance style, the inevitability of the response is often more important than an important contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need for strong, living and successfulness, even if in reality the isolation dominates.
This overwhelming success is dominated by what psychologic values call for extreme values; money, image, social status, everything on costs of intrinsic values - our internal search for personal development and friendship, which is more effective on our spiritual health.
And as a video game finger and a billioner recently explained, money can't really be bought.
The nice to friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, who was a friend by the interaction.
The Humor of Joey and Chandlers's frequent surroundings, moments at football balls in a medium sessel and the shock of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can take care of it at any time, even though they are often resting to completely explore their feelings.
As an employee of the phone seal, it explained me: "My role of listening to people who feel depressive and self-domicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
Those who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old word "I come right to it" has a huge effect, such as the feeling that it will be treated as weak when you are talking about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer longer-crisis mechanisms.
It is very clear to the small moments of men's friendships.
So very much of my objective foreign seat status on the phone can also help people at the moment of dismissing, providing long-term support from a personal family network and friends.
And so, when you visit the Comedy Central Friends Festival with the completely new-building arts for the day, why don't you then take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or even better if you see someone alone in Starbucks, give him a laugh and say hell.
You never know how different your friendship could make.
friends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
From Mary is to help PSG to cut the smells
Angel Di Maria celebrates Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his face against Malmoö.
In Maria's debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to take place to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction on the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took course when Paris Saint-Germain began his Champions League Saison with a very comfortable 2-0 winning against Malmö in the Prince Park station on Tuesday.
In Mary less than four minutes after the start of his Championship, League Debüts was a PSG player who led the French Master on the path, but then they passed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their pretending as Cavani reached a headballtor in the 61th minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachjor Donezk, also in the Group A, Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish Master, since they do not only seek the qualification for K.O. Runs but a improvement on the way towards the fourth-final finances in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they saw the points, it was not the class game of Laurent White's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's chances before the gate. He was later changing in the game against his hometown team and the agreement with which he started his illustrious career in 1999.
"It isn't easy to win home or outside in the Champions League. It's why it's a good start to win 2:0 to cause our enemies' problems and to smile back, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfectize in the course of the season," said White.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not reached one or two more towers."
Ibrahimovic returned in one of the three changes in the Paris team, which was able to hold on his own place against the Bordeaux in the First Liga, but he was cut by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian flight tour was called the man to take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken to Manchester United in the last month, and he asked why he entered into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmoo defence before he was beautiful in the long trail of the network.
But if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmoö, the Celtic was in a play-off to reach this stage, with an appiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defence and two deeply in the Mediterranean.
But except a shock of Nikola Djurdjic, who overlooked Kevin Trapps Pfosten in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG has sometimes been opened with some defects and defects, not lastly by Ibrahimovic, which was not less than five trials alone in the first half and then was set after Cavani was used after the new start.
However, he showed much more sentence when he brought his players into the game, and it was a Pass of Ibrahimovic, who transformed Di Maria into a shooting shooting, whose Wiland's 52th minute was overlooked at the flight...
The second door ended shortly after the hourmark thanks Cavani. The Uruguayr reached his sixth saisontor, after Ibrahimovic was a left flanc of Maxwell.
This ended all of the thoughts that Malmoo could return to the game, and only a wonderful invasion of Wiland from the shortest removal to stop David Luiz could keep the final result before the replacement players Ezequiel Lavezzi had been discovered at the end.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Harede, later acknowledged that PSG played a class about his team, and the Norwegians said: "The last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish Liga which did not have the same level.
The qualification games do not exceed."
Get out of Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore sammelt 2.5 billion dollars by share sales
The swimming mountain construction Riese Glencore in Switzerland, which is affected by the raw material prices, collected at midnight $2.5 billion through a sale of shares as part of its huge debt plan.
In a statement, Glencore registered in London stated that it has sold new shares in value of about 1,6 billion £ to pay its own debts.

Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (hered) dark corner is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has made for his Bible.
Klaus Oldpost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
The word was at the beginning?
No, not at the Otmar Old Bible, which is now appeared with precious images.
At the beginning, the image of Otmar Alt was formulated in 150 reasons by its entirely personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and lenwand.
His "speak" with good colors and fantastic forms has received the 75-year-old boys - but no way is equal to "speaking" images.
On the other hand, the adjustment of the subjects may affect the deepest effect through the right.
round three years Otmar Alt has worked at his Bible project, for which he took a subjective-artist selection from the many themes areas of the "Books all books".
Reconciliation are cycles that are subjects such as crossways, packs, orders or paternal.
In this way, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther's link with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler's ligation with its main point on art books.
And in particular there is the author Klaus Oldpost, who on the basis of the Maleria with the Scriptural entities.
He has interpreted the scripture chosen by Otmar Alt and thus in today, in the current collection "translated".
These texts are like verbal mirror of Alts Malerei.
They are accompanied between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and every one of the artists who forms his entire personal thinking about the situation.
The smuggling band has golden letters.
So the 75-year-old age allows to double a deep view in his soul, his emotions.
This is a high measure of intimity.
Emotions were finally resolver for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Advertisingerode and growing in Berlin, comes from a family that heard the strict protestant Lordhuter orders.
"It's the education ever happened with the rabbit," Otmar Alt recalls.
"I've tried to work this to put me back with the Lord's father."
His second concern is to help the art in fast-level time again to more place values: "The entitlement of image worlds is present today by advertising, and it is sound.
Iconics are disrupted there.
Artists have another joy and desire to show things.
Images are always secret and are not decorative.
"In this regard, I am a dinosaurer."
Otmar Alt wants to allow the viewers to "infall" images to affect, discover, discover and feel which strength they have: "This image is looking for its opposite."
Klaus Oltepost was held on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "whoever" was a loved guest of Otmar Alts art: "I like it understands life with his images."
Alt has not seen the Bible fully, but the important, secret topics for him.
"This was not cooperation at the height of the eyes," Old Post says, "This is about the pictures, the text explains lyly."
For Hans Möhler of Luther's Blood, this work is an invitation to "develop his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's images speak for masters both the (biblic) language of love and the responsibility.
A part of the original paper and lenging images - first is presented in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Earth Foundation.

The forecast statement of partners Rius that the final income for the BVB in League in Europe should be the goal of the media player Julian Weigl for complete action: "This is not so wrong."

Roboter cars: Government wants to presidency for Germany
Germany, after the will of the Federal Government, is to be the changing of the car of technological President.
The Federal Kabinett decided at midnight an strategic paper from the house of the Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on midnight in Frankfurt on the border of the IAA's Automesse from a "new mobility visitor".
The automated and connected routes will increase transport safety and care for less steel, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with its official colleagues from the G7 States, which also joined with representatives of the industry in the IAA.
The strategic paper of the Ministry of Transport highlights the importance of the mobile broadband construction and a sufficient increase in digital hearing.
To try new technology, a test track is currently on the 9-way car station in Bayern.
In order to "no additional debt risks" the federal government will examine the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments.
As a result, Germany wants to make the maximum speed for self-driving cars up to 10 to 130 km.
In addition, the Federal Government wants to introduce a change in the Wiener Convention which is only a driver to people.
In the automated drives, the car takes the drive, the driver becomes more and more to the passenger.
The technology is especially based on sensors and cameras that cover the environment and process data in seconds speed.
After a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy, high automaticized drives will be technologically possible.
Nevertheless, without vehicles on public roads were to be expected to "for the first time after 2020".
The value of the driving systems and the high-speed automated driving functions on the location in Germany are estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 to about 8,4 billion euros.
"The digital connection of the Pkw can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic", said the SPD marketing policy Sören Bartol.
The question of the accusation of accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver should, however, be clearly cleared.
However, German automobiles are still skeptical - more than French or Americans.
A survey of the Forsa Institute on the midnight of the AA is found that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomy drivers will be carried out in the coming ten years, 32 percent only claimed in 20 years so that 31 percent do not believe it.
In France, 21 percent of the respondents have been able to 2025 with autonomy drivers, 33 percent in the United States.
Indeed, the vehicles in Germany are not ready to leave completely on a self-driving vehicle.
After receiving the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to delay controls on all roads.
On the cars, it could be 15 percent in the flight, 45 percent in the steam.
Good every fourth would leave the control under no circumstances.
Boll says team and double start with tissue-EM
The village of the shore will only take part in the individual after every tenth stand at the titles of the battles from September 25 to 4 October.
The final decision shall be taken late on 22 September.
"This is a rich loss for our team."
"The kids have learned it in the morning."
"But we are sufficiently strong, even without Timo to take the title," said Federal Trainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM learninggang in Düsseldorf.
Boll was at this time on the flight to a long-term sponsor term agreed in China.
The 34-year-old German master will be returned on Friday.
"Except Timo, we're not now so clear a favorite", Demitry Ovtcharov explained.
The Hamelner, who joins the seat list in Jekaterinburg, also reminded the EM 2013 in Sweden.
"When Timo also missed, and we became European master."
"We should oriented us", explained the Fifth Worldrangelists.
The English football national player Luke Shaw from Manchester United has a serious infringement on the right skin.
In the Champions League game at the PSV endhoven, the defender was affected at a cutting of Hector Moreno and was exchanged after long treatment.
The first diagnosis stated that in the 20 years of Bastian Schwingger's 20th-year-old players were a skin invasion.
Gaultier feels too old for a child
It is a mixture of a large modern view and a guard graphic box: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) has presented an exhibition in Munchen at midnight.
The height points: creating pockets, which appear to be humanly horrible thanks to video projections.
It takes the spectacular creatures of the French designer, which, inter alia, became the large star of the modescene, and so that he stood men in a rock.
"I can't say today that I'm the bad child of the skin cotuer because I have white hair."
"Free was possible, here it's true," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (for citizens on the course of 18 September), which is to see at the art of the Hypo culture, it is a chance that the Modelor has changed his initial rejection to a view of his person.
In fact, if he had been, he said, "As a spectrum for me to die", he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the Director of the Artsthale, Roger Diederen.
It goes about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exponents give a view in the unexpected work of the man who has written modest history to have never completed a training.
Chronologically, the look is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed whole work for which a lot has been used: To fresh the powders, for example, a stylist has been involved.
14 tonnes of materials the machines have been covered by the Kurator Thierry-Maxime Loriot by Munchen.
Shortly before the October Festival, there was a special smell: a leder hose orphit with corsett.
Heydi meets Madonna.
He's always interested in strong women ("Women are weird than men") and for people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Gaulier's old Teddy is also to see in the exhibition.
He is for the first, visible moderate course of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in the football), he took his teddy BHs and clothes, said Gaultier.
With a pop, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The decrease of mode later he taught himself.
He stood models and saw the designers of other designers as Gaultier told in Munchen.
Later, I've pursued it.
For his first modern view, he didn't have to pay the models.
They found nothing, but they keeped the clamps.
Smuck instead of Gardine - Plueer shoes as mod-nice
Before it went to the long switch machines and to make the metros.
The substances and pictures covered large numbers of customers, for example they processed in coats and gardens.
This does not work only today, says Andreas Reinhardt, director of the Modespics Plueen.
Instead, the mode is again important.
In the early days of the Pluener Spitze Mode played a greater role, then the home textile industry was slowed - and now it is recovered as Nice.
Reinhardt calls some examples: pitzes in Schmuck, accessoires such as tasches and regional struggles.
The so-called Vintage Mode, which refused to denied style pockets, was an increased assignment potential.
Those who do not dwell in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
They're already doing half of all contracts with us.
Modespitze Plueen is together with nine other companies member of the Branch Association Plautener Spitze and Stickeree.
Only they can take the protected label.
In the past 15 years, some 80 percent of the transfer have been deleted.
Private business and even the big trade there is almost no longer.
Our products are still unprecedented to the customers on this way.
The massage machinery is produced in Asian space more slightly and almost expenditure by kits.
Moreover, the export weaks, currently to Russia and to the United States.
So there are reasons for new ways.
The Branch Association also tries to point out through environmental consciousness, as Cordula Bauer declared by the Stickperle in Falkenstein: "We lead a quality seal, which shows that we produce environmentally and socially."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diplome designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Sneeberger Foreign Area of the Western Zwickau High School - at the Faculty for Used Art - and is specialized on Stickerees and Spitzens.
In order to put some competitiveness from Asian space, you must find high-quality and innovative products.
It needs time and courage.
It produces a shock between the most fresh ideas of designers and the companies, especially economically thinking", says Schmidt.
Therefore, a existing design is often only easy to keep a customer's feet.
A few years ago, the historical sneeball sneeball designer Kati Reuter renewed.
Thus the machine puts a few places a small refrigerators.
The Plater Golden Meeting Master Bianca Hallebach was inspired by this: "I couldn't start with traditional snakes."
Now she uses the sneeball piece for her sweet.
In an ongoing procedure, she presents the template in silver.
"My people in the region are identified with the theme Plautener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also provides to the United States, to Australia and Finland - especially to customers who have lived in places and environments and who want to be a memorandum.
That's how I see my smile as the modern messager of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney plant new "Mary Poppins" film
Nevertheless, Disney's new movie of its classic "Mary Poppins".
However, "Entertainment Weekly" is not a new film, but a type of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magic kids.
It's about the experiences of Nanny's family Banks at the time of the World Economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins over 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unexpected.
But the government is already firm: Rob Marshall, lastly with "Into the Woods" in China.
Xi is to open the economy widely for the world
The economy must be opened to the outside to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group which has been employed with the landing of the reform.
"China should take place to shut foreign investments and knowledge and improve the business-based strategies", he said in a discussion at the 16th meeting of the Central Leader Group for the proliferation of a comprehensive reform.

After the declaration, a list of negatives is set up which identifies sectors and companies which do not in question for investments.
The system is tested and improved by test programs.

The statement also stated that China will allow border areas to investigate new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.

The meeting also took part by the Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to duplicate Quecksilber greenness in Raubfish
The European Commission wants to duplicate the border values for cocktails in large rawfish rabbits and to encourage consumers to make a significant increase in the nervous rate.
The Foodwatch consumer organization, which provides a relevant work paper of the EU, criticized the plans: "The risks and side effects of the prevented industrial and environmental policy are being continued fullly on the weight of pregnant and small children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
In accordance with Wolfschmidt, the border values of the Nerven Guide for Great Fish at the end of the food chain, such as Haie or Scheme fish from one to two milligrams of cocksilber per kilogram fish.
The large raubfishes, however, have already been so strong with cocksilbers that, on the basis of the still existing limit values, about 50% of the fleet should not be sold.
After duplicating the limit values, only 14.5 per cent would be insecure.
In contrast to this packaging, the EU, according to Foodwatch, wants to increase the border values in other fishes from now 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of checksilver per kilogram.
Foodwatch called this as "Tryck" because smaller friedfish, like some cards are usually so low that they keep the maximum values planned today.
The decrease in small fish is therefore "a perfide decrease man who helps the economy alone", explained Wolfschmidt.
Checksilber is one of the humans of high-good steel metals, which is higher than the food chain, especially in the rawfish.
The federal government is therefore warned that "also low quantities are able to cause injuries of the nervous system".
The Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage as regards the maximums available, but it is not expected that a "sancient risk of general population" is not expected.
Checksilders, especially through carbon disruption in the environment, have been achieved.
The German coal power works, according to a written outcome of the Federal Environment Ministry, to the Green Day, Annalena Baerbock was more than six tons of Quecksilber in the year, two thirds of the total amounts emited in Germany.
The concentration of cocksilbers in fishing almost in Elbe, Rhein and Donau was "should and slowly exceeded", was sent out of the paper in March.
In the past year, European warnings for checksilver in fish were among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
