The social map of the Jewish area is recognized by electronic payment.
The changes provide the maintenance of rents in the public passenger transport.
From 24 September, it is changed to the organisation of the rent passenger of citizens using the social map of the Jewish area.
According to the press office of the Government of the Russian Government on the Ivan area, changes provide the maintenance of rents to the public passenger transport and provide a schedule of mutual accounting on the social map, in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 161 FZ " The National Payment System " .
The social map of the inhabitants of the Ivan area is acknowledged by electronic payment.
Consequently, the conditions of its application are changed.
Yes, the completion limit is now not in travels as previously and in the amount of money, with the maintenance of winter and summer periods, not more than 400 rubbers in the summer period, not more than 800 rubbers in the current month.
Now, the social map owners of the kitchen vehicles have to be monitored not the number of remaining trains, but the rest of the money.
The value of the loan passenger for the citizens is of 1/2 tariff active in the transporter.
The remaining half of the cost of the passenger is the environmental budget.
The completion of the social cards remains previously - in the period from 24 of the previous month to 23 of the current month.
The new schedule of social map travel will have a number of advantages.
Similarly, a detailed account of the expenditure of money on social map was given to the copy.
Furthermore, there is a possibility of return to payment, but not expenditure of money.
We also add that the schedule of interactions with transporters is transparent, as the half of the cost of the travel pays the citizens, and the same amount is exactly reimbursed by the budget.
No committee will be cut off when the money cards are incompatible.
On the other hand, Vasilie Silikin, the Representative of the Ivanian Trade Department and Transport, reported that in 2014, more than 33 million travels were made in the region with the use of a social map, about 25 million travels in 2015.
In the area budget, more than 470 million rubbers have been provided for a loan journey with the use of the social map.
At 1 September, the reimbursement was more than 312 million rubbers.
At the time of the call, the employee is recognised in the murder of a friend
During the call at 911 vote, almost without the driving of the wheels, Shannon Lamb told the police that he shot his friend and that he needed staff who would have come home to them.
Lamb emphasized that the house had a pocket that was alive, but it was probably disappointed, and said that the contacts of the members of the family could be found in her phone.
In the house of the police found the body of Amy Printis and the note written in a white letter: "I'm very sorry, I would like all back, I love Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, as the representative of the organs signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who had made two online curses at the University of Delta in Clyde, Mississippi, had lost for 300 miles in the university camp where, as the police, he shot all the respected historical historian of Italy Schmidt on the bridge of his office.
The police head of the University of Delta Line Baford reported that university staff had learned about the shooting at 10:18 morning.
He reported that Lamb did the true call at 911 soon after that.
At the end of the day, the victims were more: Lamb ended with her when the police was surrounded.
On the next day after the shooting in the training, students and employers put to hide for closed doors, the bodies still tried to put a model of motivation that Lamba built.
The information shared by researchers in both states, as well as students and staff who knew it helped to compose talents, but may be worried to the teacher.
The students told them that they were waiting for his occupation.
The police in Gotya, where Princis died, reported that there were no accused of violence or crime.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in his written book, in which he expressed appreciation for the "people people" with whom he had settled in his preaching life.
They both provided a social science and history faculty, which contains 17 providers, and many students visited lessons.
At the same time, there were some preferences to face problems.
One student, who was well calling about Lamb, Brandon Bivers, reported that he was very nervous and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Six, reported that Lamb at the end of the 2014-15 school told him how he was fighting with stress.
The Lamb requested the University of the Delta to give him a license for disease, said that he had some health problems.
In that year, he provided only two online curses.
Recent changes in the university rule have been accepted that a doctor's stage, whose work was so slowly worked, would not guarantee the automatic receipt of the prosecutor post.
The President of the University of William LaForge reported that he had nothing to know about the conflict between Lambo and Shimed, but " apparently, Mr. Lamba had something in mind."
These are questions that Lamb can't answer.
The police attacked Lamba after his flying from the camp when he returned to the Mississippi from Arkansa.
Before he was able to arrest, Lamb was shooted from the rear of 38 calibra on the back of the house, a mile south of the house of his parents in the Greenville camp, Mississippi, reported King of Washington Metel Johnson.
His car with the driving driver still standed on the road.
It was unexpected why Lamb came to this house, although Johnson said she thought he knew the people living in him.
Lamb grows in those lands.
Lamb began working at the university, which contains 3500 students in the city with about 12000 people in 2009 and provided geographic and pedagogy.
He received the stage of the doctor's pedagogical science in the same early year.
One of the old friends Lamba described it as a wise, charistical and fun.
Karla Haarston told her that she was 15 and 20 years old, when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were taught in older classs, and he was a classic boy afternoon, who tried to learn to play her on a guitare for a few years.
In those years, he was successful for women.
Everyone of the girls were teased when he was close," says Hairston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jesson, the Brandon's emperor.
Lamb and Princess at the moment of the events, looks like they have met some time.
During the call at 911 Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage.
A couple had a song named Lytning, who lived with them in Gotya in a surgery house, which was the side of the channel.
According to the police, the dog's all right.
The former husband of Princess, Shawn O'Stin, reported that they had grown 15 years ago, but they remained friends, and that they had a daughter now 19 years old.
"It's totally rewarded," told O'Stin about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lambo, but he heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Princess when he and Abigail were both talking about a summer celebration three years ago.
Then they played together from time on the ports.
O'Stin told his daughter writes music and poet.
Princess was a nursing and worked online on different companies.
Mike Shafer, barmen, and jointly developer coordinators in the bar opened by The Julep Room, in the front of Gotia, said that he last time saw Lamba and Princess on September 5, when Lamb had finished playing a guest and a sweet warm for few visitors.
No suspect has been observed.
"There's a happy couple," he said.
We enjoyed each other and tried each other.
It means they both were very strict.
Schmidt, who was killed, conducted the seminars for the primary people and specialized in the history of Indigen Americans and colonial America, reported Don Allan Mitchell, the employer of the English language in the same school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas, Empore, and was the President of the Study Brotherhood and Study self-administration.
At the Cleveland University Camp on Tuesday, about 900 people, including universities, staff, students and community members, were involved in the memorandum of ancestors.
Ms. Schmidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt were also attended at the ceremony at which the university crowd of Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Adoptions will be re-elected in the medium.
"We're trying to return our students," said Laforte.
Crisis's gone.
Today's recovery.
Amy and Rochelio Solys report from Clilland, Mississippi.
The report was helped to prepare the authors of Associated Press Emilie Vaguester Petetus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santan in New Orlean.
Material was redistributed to the police's statement that the call Lamba had been held in the service of 911 after the murder of Schmidt, and that even though Lamb had spoken about Printis as his wife when he called on 911, the information that they had been married was not confirmed.

Michael J. Fox is talking about the witnesses with the princess of Diana
The first film "Nazad in the Future" was for Michael J. J. Fox's grain event.
She was noted for personal reasons.
"We sat in the cinematheater and waited for the arrival of the Queen's family, I noticed that the place is freely close to me, and I was here to see - the princess Diana would sit with me in the trial," he told a documentary film on the screen.
It's starting a movie, and here I'm in my head that I'm literally on the distance of the hands cut off and in one false shirt from the witness to the princess of Walk.
"On the time" is a documentary film for Nazad in the future, which includes the interview with Fox, Leye Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the director Robert Earth and the executive producer Steven Spilbergom.

Head of the United Nations claims that there is no military decision in Syria
The Secretary-General, Pan Guy Mun, reaffirms that Russia's military support would provide that for almost five-year-old conflict " there is no decision," and the weapons growth only affects violence and suffering for millions of people.
Head of the United Nations again called upon all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join and support comprehensive negotiations to find political decision.
Mr. Guy Mun stated that it plans to meet with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France during the Ministerial Session of the General Assembly in this month for the discussion of Syria.
He regretted that the disagreements in the Council, as well as among the Syrians and the local authorities, were “the situation of the unexpected”.
Mr. Guy Mun called for five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity that they had demonstrated in addressing the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in the consideration of Syrian crisis.
8 Survey results show that Donald Tramp is not smiling
Some tried to smell him a shooter.
Others were disappointed from him as a shock.
Some need scandale.
However, as some Republicans are trying to generate the high situation of Donald Trampa in the results of the surveys, they did not (together).
Decades of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trampa in two-dimensional numbers, and some have started to ask what this means for the magnifying of the possibility of receiving a namement.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the election cycle.
Nothing does mean that Tramp has the opportunity to be appointed by the Republic of Party.
The experts pointed out that in 2011, Rick Perry had introduced her best-being popularity in Germany Caine, who had not entered any State in the appointment process.
And there are many reasons why he would have been struggle with general elections.
But external groups, such as the "Political Actuality Supercommittee" of Jeba Bush, and the Conservation Group of the Growth Club, recognize the unleavenable trampa force and begin to bring their dollars to prevent it.
These are some of the surveys that say that the magnets of immobility are not just a interim phase:
The symptoms of the trampa have turned back to 180 degrees.
Once Donald Tramp anonymous its candidate in the mid- June, Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 republics were positively treated with this magnet in the area of displacement.
It was 40 per cent in the midst of July.
It was 52 per cent at the beginning of August.
Six of the 10 Republicns are now positively related to Donald Trampa.
About three of the 10 says that they have a negative view.
And all of these indicators take up the main stages.
The question of Quinnipiac in Iwave last week identified that 60 per cent of the Republicans were regularly related to Trampa.
Two thirds of the voters for the GOP would be a candidate.
In the question of the CNN/ORC last week, 67 per cent of the Republicns said that they had been "refrigerated " or " satisfaction " if the Trump would become candidate.
Only two of the 10 says they'd be distressed if he'd be a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates the same level as the Tramp (43 per cent of them say they would be "retroduced" against 40 per cent of those who say the same thing about Tramp).
The next one at the level of relief?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicns say that they would not be " satisfied" or "repressed" if they are a candidate to Jab Bush.
Most Republicans do not consider the temperature of the Trampa.
While the Trampa is massively criticized for his joy and distress, 52 per cent of the electoral Republics throughout the country believe that the Magnate is a suitable temperature to be the President, as stated by ABC News/Washington post on Monday.
The same number is in the first country of the closed congregation in the State of Aiwa, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicans believe that he is the one who may be the main team, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent believe that he is not a person who can be effective to post, and almost six of the 10 independent electors say that his temperature is not for the White House, according to the ABC/Post message.
The Republican electioners tend to this idea.
When they're shooting their shoes, the Republican electioners think that the Tramp is a strip.
The question of whom was the most reliable winner in the GOP appointment, four of 10 said that Tramp was favorite, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's not so when four of the 10 were put to Jaba Bush at the end of July.
Full discharge: GOP electioners had never had the right magic crisis.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 republicans elected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent of the possible candidate of Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP electioners are considered a trampa campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were shocked around the other candidate, Tramp remained forward to all the other.
Some have indicated that such disappearance probably plays on the advantage of Trampa, and that the unsubstituted trampas are equally distributed among more than ten other candidates.
However, the question conducted by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that the hypothetic " one " between the Tramp and most of the Republican candidates is almost always supported by the majority of the Trump.
He encountered Carly Fiorin on 13 points, Marco Ruby on 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jab Bush on 19 points, and, finally, Randa Pole, John Casich and Chris Christi for 33 paragraphs.
He has nothing with Ted Crewes.
The only candidate who's going to do it?
Ben Carson has shooted businessers at the total of 19 points in the hypothetical renovation of one to one.
More than half of Donald Trampa's partners say they've been thinking about it.
The new CBS/NYT survey shows that only more than half of the voters who support Trampa are sure in their votes.
Of course, many may happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he never changes.
46% say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, the most pressed competition in Trampa is now with a colleague-autsider of Ben Carson, but electors who say they have thought that they would probably choose Trampa.
Six of the 10 Republicns say they agree with the Tramp on Immigration.
Since Donald Tramp two months ago called immigrants from Mexico in their open-ended campaign, the theme of immigration became the most active in the discussions in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trampa's garage will reject the key electioners of Latin American origin from the Republic of the Republic and prevent rebursement.
However, in accordance with the question of ABC/Post held on Monday, six of the 10 Republicns said they agree with Trampo in immigration issues.
Thus, until the immigration focused on the general attention, it seems that Donald Tramp remains at the same position.
The distress of the Government has made new trafficking.
Donald Tramp and Ben Carson are now supporting almost half of the Republican electors, mainly because of their status of autsyders.
Six of the 10 Republics on Monday, ABC/Post states that they may wish political athletes than men with experience in the Government.
They're also buried at Washington.
The question Des Moines Register/Bloomberg, held two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iwai have been disappointed by the activities of the Republicns in the Congress, with 54 per cent of "unpleased" and 21 per cent of "in agestion".
The Government decides to the Court of Pension Indexation in October.
Vice-Premier RF Olga Holga Holdows said that the Government now seeks an application of the Pension Index Act in 2016 to a real inflation level.
She noted that the decision should be found at 8 October at the time of the draft budget for the next year to the Government.
In addition, Cambodia discusses the option for proliferation of the decisions on the raw pension of the Russian assaulting pension.
The head noted that the amount of pension captures equal to 350 billion rule.
The amount of pension indexation should be for the next year.
According to Vice-Premier, there is no final decision on the question of whom should pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
The Chief believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not relate to the socially protected categories of citizens, it is not absolutely fair that it pays the society for it.
The media previously reported that two options of the guest balance were considered in the castle.
Why are they often disappointed and redden?
The doctor-oftalmologist Tatiana Levashwa answers:
Our centuries are the widths that protect the eye ball from the multitude of small parts that sit on them.
When we forget the regular cleaning of the ice, we often contribute to the development of the litary.
Easy Output:
Don't tried the eyes of the slaughtered hands, and take a special silver for the dwelling;
No 1-2 times a day, purify the land from those covered in them for the day of harmful substances.
cleaning procedures are limited to complement and warm compromise with the disappearance of milk breasts (shalfey, routines), smell secrets of salt iron, and then the massage of shoes, which should be carried out by rounding thicks;
Smoking the maquillage, do not use spot-containing materials.
They smell and discharge the skin and contribute to further protection of the secret of salt irons.
The Phine claims that the Korean nuclears have created a atomic fighter.
North Korea's authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country was the nuclear complex in Yunban.
This report occurred on the website of the Headquarter of the country's Telegraph Agency.
It is noted that the CDR is ready to respond to the "agression and nuclear threat of the United States" and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons as a number and quality.
The last test of nuclear weapons of North Korea has been carried out in 2013.
In that regard, the reactor ' s full rebuilding plans have not been reported since then.
The Phone claims that he could create an atomic fighter.
Also, the CDR has tested a medium and little delay, writes polit.ru.
The Jürin was required to get out of the Russian giant to mention the brothers of the brothers.
Leader LDPR, Vladimir Jurinois, believes that the national ring should take note of the association of the brothers ' s peoples.
In this regard, he declared during the Gosmith meeting, reports the Russian news Service.
Who are these people now?
Fashists and murderers!
"The longest jinn, the longest in the world, even the sports are not overlooked," said Jyrinow.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all fourths, including:
In the late 2014, Jürinus stated that the current jinn had to be replaced by the "God, the king of the guards" and the Russian tricolor to replace the Imperial fleet, writes polit.ru.
Asad urged all forces to join terrorism.
The President of Syria Bashar Assad called all forces to join terrorism.
Asad is sure that if Europe wants to address the problem of refugees, they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe takes or does not take refugees, but that it is necessary to eliminate the first cause of this problem.
If Europeans worried about the judge of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our view of this problem.
"In this is the question of refugees," he said in the interview.
We must continue dialogue on behalf of consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are not possible until people die, until blood is continued and people feel fully safe.
"So we can achieve consensus, but we can't realize anything until we won terrorism in Syria," said Asad.
Remember, this year, about 5000,000 migrants arrived in the European Union, including Syria.
The European Union stated that the current migration crisis in the world was greater since the second World War.
It is not excluded that among the arrival of migrants in Europe, thousands of the extremist group "Islam State" might have been able to be fighting.
Members of the terrorism organization prohibited in Russia may use the situation in order to create their cells in the EU to conduct terrorist activities.
The people of the German city have established a festival for refugees.
In the last month, Germany became a refugee leader, although recently she has enhanced the border control to keep them pressed.
According to the authorities, about 8000,000 migrants will arrive in Germany until the end of this year, although some experts are called a significant number.
Since September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
Correspondent Bi-bi-si Jenny Hill was located in the city of Darmstadt, whose migrants are very warm.
Jeremy Corbin deals with the questions of the Prime Minister
Following the elections, Mr. Corbine is expected to deal with the questions of the Prime Minister ' s session
Jeremy Corbin, a new leader of the Leборist Party, will immediately take place at the meeting of the Prime Minister's first session, measured by the force of David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will speak with the first of the six issues on the second half of the day; for his statement, the press and the members of the Parliament of the Leyborist Party will probably be able to follow the press and members of the Leyborist Party.
He spoke with a call for "lower theatre and more facts" for a weekly demonstration.
He also said that he could leave some meetings by leaveing them to the colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as a leader; the meeting will occur after the appointment of the Ten and his speech at the Thursday annual Congress on Thursday.
As a result of the decision by the leader of the lebourists, he was sweet in the event of the national giant service at Tuesday, the 75-year-old Bishop of Britain expressed a critical issue from a number of conservative members of the Parliament and became a subject of a number of previous articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbina did not smell the public jinn
Mr. Corbina's secretary claimed that he had been "in almost silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal VS in the Beatwe for Britain".
However, a member of the Tenor Office, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, reported Newsnight to BBC 2, that he would recommend the leader of the Leaders to sing a national "independence" from his confidence in the need to cancel the monarchy.
A few ten ministers refused to play in the team, Mr. Corbin, with a difference in economic, defence and international policy, while at least one sixth members of the parliamentary party supported it as a leader.
The Political Correspondent BBC Robin Brown said that political differences are also “coated” in the library party after the appointment of Mr. Corbin to post in the European Union and the restriction of compensation payments by the Government.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Conference of Traditions that the Laybourist Party had amended the idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Dark Minister of Labour and Pensions stated that there was a "complete clearness" in the party that it was only in opposition to the Governments' plans to reduce the higher limit from 26,000 feet to 23,000 feet.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the lebourists whom David Cameron meets in the "Corry shop" for the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservation Party.
The leader of the lebourists, who promised another approach to policy, states that he had “approved collective resources” to take the ideas of Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
The Member of the Parliament from the Irington North stated that the question of the Prime Minister is a extreme conflict, and that it would continue and from the strict answers and exchanges of colleagues, instead he promised to concentrate on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems rather than young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angel Ygel, Minister of Economy in the Canadian Tower, would vote on the matters of the Prime Minister when he would be missing, for example, when Mr. Cameron is outside the border.
He also heard the idea to let other brothers say, if possible, that he had addressed the Palestine of the John Burco, to discuss this issue.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he would want to go from the political style of the " marine balance " often associated with the procedure of the Prime Minister but acknowledged a few years later that it couldn't.
Since the first transmission in 1990, the Prime Minister's issues became the key indicator of leadership, their ability to manage the Party of the Community and Reputation in other members of the Parliament, although the critics claim that this has become a career and requires extensive reform.

The sterling fund increased more than 1 per cent in relation to $1.5505 and $1.84 per cent for euros, was €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index increased to 6229.21 per cent.
The SABMller shares were generally grown up to 20% through the purchase proposal from AB InBev competitive.
It would combine two larger drinking companies in the world, gathering such burdens like Budshair, Stella Artois, Butni and Grolsch.
Burberry has grown up to 0.9 per cent of the competitive news from the competitive product group of the Richemont class producers.
Recently, Richemont's sales data overlook all the expectations and showed that selling in China is on the key market for Burberry again starting to grow.

JD Sports has grown after the supplier of sports clothing reported about 83 per cent of the growth of twenty-eight million feet per year.

Metcash launchs the initiative to fight the Nazi Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA purchase from the Aldi button in South Australia and Western Australia.
The OECD Food Manufacturer launched a market share of IGA rituals in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the future income of Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is prepared to open two optical components and first of 120 businesses in South and Western Australia at the beginning of the next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets have strengthened the relationship with local food providers, and through the IGA market in leading media and social networks and the type of "Adelaide Show".
The campaign is joined by ritualists and suppliers of IGA, such as the manufacturer of the marine Simmo's in Dansbourg, which offers a degust in IGA shops, and owners of shops sold by permanent tickets to the football League of South Australia.
It is expected that Metcash will develop more details of its protection strategy on 29 September - day when this advanced supplier of food, drinks and substantive products will take place on its annual day of investor strategies.
There is a small number of extents, because in South Australia and Western Australia, the IGA shop is almost 30 per cent of all Metcash shops and shows higher rentity than the Metcash IGA network in Eastern States.
The purchasers in South and Western Australia are known as ad hoc routes, so the market is more favourable for IGA riders than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland states, more than 30 per cent in Southern and 24 per cent in WA, compared to approximately 14 per cent in Eastern States.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi is 5 per cent of the food market in these two states for 12 months after the opening of its first shops, taking the number of events in all present players, but primarily in independent rituals.
In the report published this week, Tom Kirat, Morgan Stanley analysis, believes that IGA rituals can lose $360 per year and Metcash $2,2 million to the end of 2016.
The project is based on the permission that Aldi is opening 25 shops in SA and 30 WA in the next year, purchasing $500 million and $600 million respectively on these markets.
The loss of the feed and sales of food at high-level Metcash costs may contain about 13 million income for payment and taxes, Mr. Kirrat.
At the same time, Metcash lost the share of the market in the Eastern States, mainly from Aldi and Coles, and this was the recent study of Morgan Survey found that the most faithful purchasers of the IGA had.
Morgan Stanley considers that Metcash food sales will be 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reduced the market company rate from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent to 2020.
Last week, the fund manager Hamish Dugolos, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, noted that Metcash could " with high chances to disappear during the decade.
The Metcash company refused publicly to comment Mr. Dugles' comments.
But it is suggested that the member of the Directors of Metcash company had been linked to Mr. Dugles last week.
The rate of IGA in the market was decreased from 2010 from 18 to 14 per cent, and Metcash income from food products undertaken by some 1200 IGA rhythms was 43 per cent, compared with 2012, as a result of the operational delegation and the pressure on sales and retail rates.
However, the company is not payable, more than $1,1 million annually because of balanced prices in Coles and Woolworths for thousands of weekly positions, and helping IGA rituals to rebuild trade areas, as well as proposing a rapid expansion of raw products and more wide selection of food products.
The Director-General Metcash Yen Morris said that the balance of prices and the restructuring of trade areas is covered by trafficking, and hopes that the company will be increased in the purity of arrive in 2017, first in four years.
Tanasy Cookinskis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hile
Tanasy Cookinakis is worthy of counts, not critical for his conduct.
Tanasy Cookinakis has recently suffered in a skandal around his friend Nick Kryross and has more than critical, as President Tennis Australian Steve Hilli says.
Cookinakis, the young in the talent and often called "Special Ks" was not volunteerly focused on the turn of Montreal Masters.
Shortly after that, at the time of a heat qualified shop in Cincinits, the judges had two times to discover Cokinskis and his opposer Ryan Harrison, said, "The Bavaria had to put on the Kyross shoes, and I have to put on the shooting of this guy."
After the last time that Cookinakis saw a shooting missile after his feet saved Rishara Gaske from the possible struggle on the United States, Hili protected loyally Cookinskis.
Young people are currently in Glasgo, with Sam Grood's right to be second after Bernard Tommych in the single routine of Kuba Davis against Britain.
"I'm so worried about one thing, namely that Tanasy had been in the conflict," said Hilli.
He really broke a missile when he had a foot on the US open, but he wasn't the first player who slaughtered a missile when hoped, and I know Tanas's enough good enough to be sure that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he had a very well-bearing situation in the United States, with Harrison and etc., and I'm sure he would be trusting.
He's around a good team, he's a nice family, and I just think he's done a little unhonorable.
He's a very nice 19-year-old man, he's working a lot, well in the team, he's never had problems with other players, he's respecting it outside the corte, he's training intensively, he's in a good shape, he's a very widespread and developed young man, and I think it's to be assessed by the dignity.
Hilli also supported the decision to forgive Kyros for the important shop that started on Thursday, in view of the right way towards all, but considering that the guy from Canberra returns to the team as a long-term player.
"Before all we want the team to focus on the match, not on the conversation around [Christos]," said Hills.
And I think that Nick has made a very fast power that proves people like the Federer and Mareya, he grows up in the public, lets a number of serious mistakes and benefits all the critical that he receives, but we try to help him understand the consequences of his action, and I need to take him out of the centre of care for some time to think about them, and that's best for the team and the best for it.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency situation, closes the border, delays migrants
When Hungary announced an emergency situation, in the Tuesday, the border with Serbia was crossed in the south of the border and delays those who are trying to go into the country unlawfully to keep the flow of migrants within the river.
A hundred migrants were covered on the border, and the Serbian authorities were very negatively reacted.
At an uncertain time, the road between the two control points, those flying from armed violence in the family, disappeared the palaces and settled on this place.
Nevertheless, inflictness has been insufficient.
When the police helicopter circled over them, the migrants cryed to "Clear the border" and cryed to the address of a special appointment.
Some protests refused food and water.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia announced the "unacceptable " expulsion of migrants from Hungary when they come from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be a part of the problem, not a co-conciliating damage.
The next days we have to be negotiated with Brussels and other countries,” said in the Prague of the Ivy Darchich.
Volunteers on the Venice-Serba border began on the next day after the block of 28 countries could not develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to provide a general responsibility for 40,000 persons who seek refugees in the overlaped Italy and Greece and expressed hope that in the future (in the next month or at the end of the year) will be reached a agreement to the Member States of Europe, including refugees from Hungary.
The President of Germany, Angela Merckel and Austria, was required to gather the extreme Summit of Europe in the next week to discuss an immigration crisis covering the continent.
Hungary, however, is not hoped of rapid action from Brussels or neighbouring.
In Friday, the emergency situation in two Southern regions gave the authorities more power to act on the crisis, allowing them to switch the road and accelerate the cases of rescue.
At the time of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Venice Peter Siyarto stated that his country plans also to switch out of the border in Romania to move migrators through the country when it was completed in the Serbian border.
The Correspondent CBS News Charles Dagata reported that even prisoners had been connected to an urgent work on the end of the shipment between England and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary became the main "looking place" and the point of transfer of the border of Europe for the population, many of which are refugees as victims of war in Syria and the Middle East.
However, the Prime Minister of the country, Victor Orban, emphasized that most people in the country are economic migrants who are looking for more well-being than refugees, are victims of military action that have the right to protect, and that point of view is closely divided into the views of other EU countries, etc., Germany.
New laws entered into force in Hungary now are considered a crime of remission or damage of the 4-metre (13-foot) injury made by the Government towards the southern border with Serbia and include more long terms of prison for the trafficking of people.
"The venerian Government, due to the situation of the mass migration, declares an emergency situation," stated journalists to the Government of Seltan Kovach in the southern city of Segade.
We understand clearly: the illegal revision of the border is a crime.
Regularly, the parliament should still authorize the location of military forces that is expected for the next week, but the Associated Press reporters that are on the border have already been observed over a few days of the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs.
Dear Bacondi, the Adviser for National Security, reported about 45 persons who tried to move the border on the border, and 15 other persons within the country.
They have crossed the border, breaking the detention, now under the police detention and accused of the judicial violations of new laws.
The authorities quickly restore the seat.
The Vienna authorities also closed two of the seven passengers on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, striking to block one of the passengers of the iron coat.
Orders were shocked through the main slope of the border around the city of Riosk (Hungary), since the cities have placed a serviceplace for the slope of people within the metal container, and the clusters gave each other to switch into.
There were about 20 persons inside, and thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main truck from Serbia to Hungary and announced the refusal of food and water until they passed in Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hilary Clinton's Excellency of Bernard Sanders has been decreased in a national survey
The former secretariat Hillary Clinton continues to keep the double advantage in the shock of democracies in the country, but Mr. Bernie Sanders approve it.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of the primary democratic electioners (both 58 per cent) and Sanders is a second of 27 per cent (over 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Bayden, who has not yet announced whether he would participate in the presidency, receives 15 per cent of the primary democratic electioners.
Over five months before the competitive elections, most democratic elections say that it was too early to say that they were determined with the candidate to support.
Clinton's parties are more sure in their election, except supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey in the last month, Clinton lost support for some demographic groups, Sanders reached some of them.
Clinton holds a great advantage between women and dead, but it has decreased.
Her support among men is significantly lost, and Sanders remains on paragraph 5 of it.
The proposal for Clinton's Democratic Electors for 50 years has disappeared, and they are with Sanders now at the same time.
But Clinton still has a great advantage among the senior electors.
In the last month, Clinton has doubled Sanders to a double number of Liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
About half the primary democratic elections throughout the country say that they would support Clinton if it would be candidate to this party.
Fourth would support her with some reservations, and 15 per cent would support her only because it was candidates.
Six percent would not support her.
It may be unexpected that Clinton's current partners probably show more enthusiasm on her account.
Between those who do not support Clinton at this time, the views are more contrary - only some four with an enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of the primary democratic elections say that they would have supported Clinton with enthusiasm, less of the Republican electors say the same, Donald Tramp (35 per cent).
When Clinton's partners have an open question why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the need for experience (16 per cent), then that the time of the Chairperson (13 per cent), and that it is the best candidate to this post (10 per cent).
Clinton's partners also said about the association linked to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called an agreement on issues and opportunities for election.
As Vice-President considers potential participation in elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic elections would like to be joined to the gang, although the third believes that it should not.
When they ask who they would like to see in the second place among the candidates of the party, the primary democratic elections in most cases call Bayden.
Among Clinton's most half says they would have chosen Byden to the second, it's more than Sanders.
If Bayden decides not to put his candidate from the Democratic Party, the advantage of Hillary Clinton over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Byden from 30 points without it.
Fifty-five per cent of the democratic electioners are seen in Clinton with the best chances of winning over the general elections, but the number has reduced from 78 per cent in the last month.
Byeden, with a large departure in the second place, increased the percentage of those who believe it as the most reliable candidate.
However, with the answer to the question that the most important thing in the candidate, democratic elections choose other options, instead of the opportunities to be elected.
Similarly in the last month, no candidate from democracy or potential candidates is an unacceptable nomination for these primary electors.
The candidates from democracy, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among the primary electors from their party.
Most believe that Clinton, Sanders and Bayden are honest and reliable to trust in people with good leadership.
Byeden of all three lies honestly, and Clinton's strong side in its leaderships.
30 per cent of the primary democratic electioners do not consider Clinton a honest and rewarded trust, two times more than those who say the same on Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent have no view of it.
The primary democratic elections are generally considered similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Bayden.
For all of these measures, some four democratic electioners have no view of Sanders.
Although the issue of the personal e-mail sheets and servers at Hillar Clinton continues to be cut by the secretariat, most democratic electioners are satisfied with its explanation on this account and believe that this has not affected the general view of it.
But it's a very different story in the American public in general.
The half of the Americans today have not been satisfied with its explanation and only about a third.
The public's opinion was on this point in March, soon after the story was known.
Most Americans say that there was no impact on the general view of Clinton, although 36 per cent of them say that their opinion was worried.
The Republicans, more than six of each 10, claim that their views about Clinton have been worried.
Even though Clinton is considered the honest and reliable trust of electors from her party, it continues to be a problem among the registered electors in general: only 32 per cent of its honest and providing confidence, at eight paragraphs below in comparison with the last month, and 15 compared to her mother.
Sixty-third percent of the electors registered does not consider its honest and rewarded trust.
At the same time, 55 registered electors throughout the country do not consider Trumpa honest and reliable trust.
However, both Clinton and Tramp have a good mark on leadership.
From the six protested candidates of Bayden, Carson and Bush show the best results of honestity.
Most people see Sanders more honestly than not, but, like Carson, many have no view of him.
The error for the selection of 351 primary democratic elections is 6 per cent.
According to the national survey Ben Carson, Donald Trampo
Ben Carson was in charge to get to Donald Trampoo in the last CBS/New York Times survey
Two candidates made half of the votes of the electors in a new survey, left all the other in search for opposites under the footsteps
The Republican electioners throughout the country continue to support Trampa massively, which has increased from 23 per cent of the recent CBS in Fox News discussion in the last month, until 27 per cent in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson fled the same period from 6 per cent to 23 per cent.
The survey also showed that Carson was supported in all demographic groups, confusioning Trampa in a group of representatives with higher education.
Recent candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ogayo John Kascha, have been displaced back with the Governor Viscals Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10 per cent in the last month to 2 per cent.
The former Governant of Florida, Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Arkansa Mike Hakabi and Senator from Florida Marco Rubio are together with the third place of 6 per cent.
The request for the election of 376 representatives in this new survey was 6 per cent, the investigation was held in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed the growth of Carson in the surveys in 19 per cent of the Republicns, with 32 per cent of support.
The last survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Tramp was significantly infringed by Carson.
With regard to the growing support of Carson, the last week Tramp had made a number of critical accidents to the former neurochirurg address, even when Carson regreted that the Trump's faith was doubtful.
"We need energy," said Tramp last Saturday during the shutting of the Iwave campaign.
Four brothers are accused of the death of the first college Baruch
About two years later, after the death of a college, the brotherhood in the mountains of Popono in Pennsylvania was arrested against five persons.
"The members of Pie Delta Psy from the New York College of Burch strictly attacked Chana "Mycla" Dana during the routine in September 2013, and did not put it in the hospital at the time that had been killed for her death," reported to the police.
Official persons say that a student with inclined eyes and a 30-four-four century pigs had touched a few times since he tried to achieve the goal, a scope of surface.
Mr. Deng finally congratulated his head and then fall without conscience.
The members of Pie Delta Psy did not call at 911 when Dengue lost conscience and waited for more time before he was taking it to the hospital, says to the police.
They, however, found time to change the clothes of Dengue, find his symptoms in Gugla and contact with Andy Menng, the National President of Brothers, to ask the Council, as reported at the press conference of Chris Wagner.
“At this time, brothers began to hide personal property, as a result, to make the well-being of the brothers above the health of Michael Dengue,” said the Chief Wagner.
He couldn't save, and he ended the next morning.
According to the coverage report, Dengue received a number of smells of heads, smooth and poor.
"A lot of families suffered from brotherhood rhythms, since at least one student dies during them every year, starting from 1970," said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brothers and their members should be responsible, and this step from the authorities is very important.
The court boards of Monroe were sentenced for the murder of the third stage for the first five members.
30 other members, including Mr. Menga, have been accused of violence against news and crime.
"We want to be responsible for not only individual parties, but, if there was an organization that has authorized all this officially or informally, it and it", said Vaganer at the Press Conference on Tuesday.
The College Baruch prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood was excluded from its structure of the local office.
What happens when the Federal Reserve increases the percentage rates
The rate increased, and the "float market" is confronted, the income of the flows increases, and the economy has fallen in recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know, that's how long it's going to be, and how long it's going to be.
It is essential for the economy to explain the time.
The recession started only 11 months after the first increase of the rate and totally 86 months.
The Federal Reserve Leverance of Taxes often, although not always, determines the reaction of economic and financial assets.
The United States Central Bank is therefore so slightly stressed that investors should not be focused on the starting of taking taxes and how much the adaptation will be taken.
Indeed, the multitude of those changed.
At the end of the end, however, the market participants may find that the whole rates are overwhelmed.
"The further increased rate of the Federal Reserve, with the invasion of global financial crisis, will be unevitably interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the EEA", reported Julian Jessop, the main specialist for the international economy in the Economic Capital, in its comments for customers.
On the contrary, we are not expecting that the progressive return of percentage in the United States to more normal, but still lower levels will be a sexual impulse that many are threatened.
This does not mean, but it will not be the consequences.
This is how some economies could react in depending on historical trends:
As the market has already seen in the last months or around, the expectation of increased rates may lead to uncertainty at some time.
However, in the increase of rates, the consequences are generally not such dramatic.
"It seems to be income from actions for 12 to 24 months after the first squeeze, which may probably reflect the delay in monetary policy," said the German Bank analysis in the recent study of the results of increased rates of the Federal Reserve.
In particular, the market is more slightly changed over the last 35 years - about 14 per cent of the rate increase, remains sufficiently rare for 250 days after that (mean growth, 2,6 per cent), then, over 500 days, returns to the average income of 14.4 per cent of the last six cycles, according to the recent analysis carried out by Bob Doll, the main trade policy specialists in New Asset Management, the public in Barrons.
German says that the results for valuable burdens do not tend to become more expressed at the stage of increased rates, and income from actions begins to reduce.
Recesions are the fact of economic life, but increased rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve has put into conditions that have not previously existed and could accelerate the recession.
Mainly, the currency internal product will be almost in its lowest point for the existence of an increased rate.
According to the German Bank, 118 cases of increased rates since 1950 were only two times of the nominal annual SBBB below 4.5 per cent.
Even if he was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it is long, while only 1,5 per cent of the Atlanta Fed data.
In German, the increase in the rates of such an instability economic background may be risked and asks "does it be differently", reported.
The market participants are prepared to increase the rate of the Federal Reserve System throughout the year, with their view to the meeting of the Federal Market Opening Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategic and economic experts believe that FOMC could accept increased rates at this meeting, the feast trade is only 25 per cent of the possibility.
"In our study since 1950, all the rates of increased rates have been in the super-operational increased financial market in GDP, which predicted the recession, very fast after the start of recovery, " states the report.
In contrast, it was extremely slowly recovery after the worst recession of the election period.
The current cycle at this time is the length of which the Federal Reserve System had expected from the end of the last recession; the recourse has been 35 months, and it is already 74 months and has not been completed.
The fixed income was also insufficient while the market expects for increased rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the income carried out for actions.
The principle difference is that the effects of the effects are more rapid than for actions when the federal system changes strategic course.
In cases, the income seems to be changed immediately after the initial increase/reduce of the rates in the cycle.
In the end of the cycle, the revenue rate is immediately falling", reports Germane.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that increased rates will lead to the accuracy of long-term and short-term revenue levels, making a more polar.
The high income gap is often better in this climate, although "we are still worried about income income", says Catey Jones, the analysis of the fixed income in Schweab.
It is interested that Johns considers that the markets have already been adapted to the expected results of the federal policy system.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations, the market has shown that a more strict monetary policy has been made", wrote it.
The rates of short-term employees have increased, with the increase of the income of more polar, credits have increased, and the flexibility of all market features has increased when the federal system has implemented policies.
In general, the company that leads to its main business in the United States wins from increased rates, and the local production will become more attractive.
International companies have long been worse, since the increased dollar makes their production more costly in the world market space, and their debt is more costly in financial.
The story shows that the "case" actions have demonstrated the effectiveness of the market over three months after the initial increase of the rate", said the Goldman Sachs analysis in the report for customers.
The company with a stability financial status has been insufficient on the results of each increase in the 1994, 1999 and 2004 average of 5 per cent of the rates.
The company with high income of the capital and low-government shares have also shown the best effectiveness than low quality actions, average 4 (per cent) and 3 (percentage paragraphs) respectively.
The duration will be a great question.
The company with high percentage of swimming debts lose more, according to Goldman.
In addition to pursuits, the consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
The income could also be seen by higher income, although the experts depend on how fast this happens.
"BBC Radio 3 - Classic FM copy", states a member of the Parliament from Andrew Bingham
Member of the parliament of Andrew Bingham has discovered the station for "Reducing standards"
It demonstrates that it is less different from the commercial competitor
The BBC Music Awards also emphasized that the premium is just counter to Brits.
The colleague on the parliament of Damien Collins, who was infringed in The Voice with the same criticism, was not originalized.
"BBC Radio 3 becomes classic FM", said the leaders of the parliament, encouraging telecommunication to prove that it does something that does not commercial company.
The member of the parliament from the Consertors Andrew Bingham also declared the BBC guide that it seems to be the public radio "Glupeet" and becomes less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 looks like I don't like to use the word for forgiveness, but it seems to be classic FM," he said.
He also stressed the BBC Music Awards' premium in the last December.
BBC Music Awards, who was born last year, looks like The Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else -- this is two examples that the first ones came to me in the mind, in which you actually just copy what is already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of BBC rejected the accusedness, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was far forward to his commercial partner when the case was related to live music and audio education.
What I know through Radio 3, I don't know anymore about classic music.
And his loyalty to the living statements and the creation of music is indeed not compared to anyone.
"I think it's really very important, and I think the interest in Radio 3 in searching for a new music and promoting new events," he said.
The BBC Radio 3 Alan Dave said that radio stations had to work much more to take audience than in the past, because the Britishs were less classic musical education.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC, which had been attacked by the attacks of the competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Cultural, Measuring and Sport.
The member of the parliament by Thory Damien Collins attacked The Voice musical show that BBC purchased in the Dutch Talpa Media for an orientational price of 22 million feet of sterling.
See why this programme is often discussed in the absence of originality and different aspects?
Lord Holl states that BBC 1 show, in which Palm Feat and Boy George participated as judges, was made in the "typical BBC style".
He added to the Corporation what he wants to be "wet in his own home gate" next time he would start a developing project.
However, it does not consider that it is necessary to prevent the order of the new sessions of The Voice in the future or to use money those who pay the licensing collection for other forms.
The Internet sales rose was slower in August, and it may therefore be the Black Fifth
In the first three months of 2015, the increase of online sales to 7 per cent was observed
Last month, the late growth has been observed since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales have been actived three years ago by using mobile devices for shoping
Experts believe that the November Black Five could contribute to the detention of the costs
For about ten years, the vulcanic shooting experiences a boom, transforming many central streets in Britain to a precaution city.
But experts say that there have been signs of online sales balance, after the last data shown only seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The overall online-shaped expenditures in August have shown minimum growth since they began to be fixed in 2000, with only 5 per cent increased.
Experts say that there have been signs of online sales balance, since the last data showed only seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at growth in the past years and return to 2000 g, they have always found a reasonable explanation", said Guardian Andy Malkech, editor of the IMRG sale index.
He explained that online sales have been intensified three years ago when the buyers started using their mobile phones to purchase.
This means that more people had received the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do it in any condition, for example, sit on the wall.
But now it comes to the payment, and you can see the decline (on growth).
The New York Times phenomenon, who came from the United States, mentioned as one of the reasons for the delay.
Experts believe that the purchasers could stop the purchase of the event that happens on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, the purchasers spent five times more average to computers to be able to use profitable proposals by violating the same number of seller web sites.
Experts believe that the Black Five when purchasers are in the real battle for the purchase, they could put people away from the shooting
According to the study published by British Retail Consortium, more than 1 pound of sterlings are online.
With regard to goods such as television and driving machines, more than one third is sold through the Internet magic.
At the same time, more than four people purchase clothes and embraces online than in modern shops on central streets.

The British News Agency did not report this detail, but reported that the leaders of the company were prohibited to go outside the country.
Last week, Salaman promised to explain the reason for the fall of the crown in the main sword where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were shocked to go to Haj this month.
The Binladin Group did not make any statements on the abuse of the land, and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Kingdom Decree also condemned the company in non-use of modern security measures and inadequate agreement with the meteorological service.
Decades of pines are around the Main Lower of the Mexican Sword, within the extensive construction works conducted by the Binladin Group.
The family Ben Laden in the decades includes the nearest family of Saudi Arabia and leads to larger construction projects.

The officials reported that 158 persons remained in the hospital.
Official persons decided to pay a million rivals (approximately 174,000 feet) to the parents of the dead, and the same amount was unreasonable.
The final victims receive half of this amount.

According to Veronica Larry, the British people are increasingly taking repair specialists
The number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe grows
The result is opening more than 200 new Screwfix shops for specialists
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q shops throughout the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, head of the city Correspondent Daily Mail
They say that the Britishs are put into the side of milk and malarian skins, and instead they take qualified Eastern Europeans to carry out home work
If you can talk to a milk or a ball red the wall, it seems that you're in minority today.
Because, according to the B&Q owner company, the British people are increasingly taking master specialists to carry out an uncomfortable home work.
Veronica Lori, the new Director-General Kingfisher, who owns the home-based services network, reported that this train had a significant scope of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering minimum price services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 Screwfix shops specialized for masters and also close 60 B&Q shops.
Ms. Lari said that she would like to see more women in the composition of B and Q shops, as eight of the 10 of the purchase decisions were taken by representatives of the weak field.
Today, most of the staff are men.
In its words, it is not possible to observe the last demographic trends that characterize the increase in the number of households with single women, more than in the past.
Ms. Lori said, "The man still works in our shops.
We need to take steps to achieve the balance.
In general, half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions for the purchased products are taken by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Lori is one of the five women in the UK leading companies whose actions are taken into account in the FTSE 100 index, and has also changed the composition of the drivers teams, accompanied by the directors of the equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher is not the only company that is about 50 per cent of women, including the general and financial director.
Ms. Lori said: "This was a conscious decision, the diversification is a important issue for us.
The Board of Directors was not difficult to find suitable women.
After the group has taken its shopping expenditure, Kingfisher's company showed the reduction of arrival and sales in half a year.
As a result of the Kingfisher train, owner of Screwfix and B&Q, 200 new shops will be opened
Time for decisions on the percentage rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The World is looking at the meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which is discussed within two days of the decision to take or not a percentage rate in the first decade.
Reuters' 80 economicists reported that more than half of those still believed that the Federal Reserve would now believe that it was still slowing and maintaining a rate of 0 to 0.25 per cent of the current diameter.
This is a historic event, because it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve has decreased the rate to zero.
The first time we approach that the main bank can be accompanied with the nucleus note and start the standardization of percentage rates," said Anhel Wilde, director of the International Economy Institute.
The United States economy works effectively, economicly, adds trillions to the balance report and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision affects the world economy.
He warned the market that it should be prepared for changes, but all of them said their confidence is that all opportunities against such a step were possible.
The decision will be announced at 2000 CET on Tuesday.
New Balkan Street: Refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Attention!" is scanning hundreds of refugees in the Horgosh control point on the Serbsk-Venger border.
From Tuesday, Budapesh has passed the border to the residents.
Refugee searchers have already started to experience other route options in Europe.
One of them is through Romania in the closed border with Serbia.
The other is through Croatia and Slovenia in Austria.
A number of data shows that buses that have carried refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now sent to the city of Shid to the Croatian border.
The Völders received the provision of the authorities to follow without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of Internal Affairs, Neboish Stepanovic, ensures that his country do everything to help refugees but is limited to its possibilities:
Our work is to protect Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help those people to make a huge relationship with them.
But it's already a common European problem.
It is unlikely, no country in Europe will do so alone, and a smaller country as Serbia is.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Victor Orban is unprecedented:
If someone is called a refugee in Serbia, he must fill the necessary documents for that document.
And if he doesn't do this, he will not be in our country, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already established a 175-third strip on the border with Serbia.
But Orban is not intended to stop it: it plans to make the same reimbursement on the border with Romania.
Buharret already stated that it was incompatible with European principles.
The Encyclopædia Britannica: "Europe wants to help us."
The angels of Meimarracis have been in the legal centre governments who, according to the left, have come to the country of the financial crisis for a few years.
He now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, slows the calls of Cyprus.
In a few days before the election, he met a journalist Euronus.
Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to the Eurours!
Evangelium: Thank you for the invitation.
12 months ago, your party suffered a devastating conspiration, engaged in the SIRISA coalition, but now, on the question, the "new democracy" compared with it as a popularity.
What has it changed for that time?
The Gospels: Greece has changed, and we too.
Mr. Cyprus was a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget and economic growth perspective.
Now, the country has a re-budgetary deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors went out because Mr. Cyprus's spent them.
In the last nine months, Greece was able to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Cyprus.
And now they can easily compare the promised thing in reality.
The daily life was significantly worse compared to January when the situation was improved, with which the majority of Greek citizens were involved.
You say, however, if you are victory, you will try to join the other parties, including the SIRZs.
The Encyclopædia Britannica: The fact that, as we have understood over the past few years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
Indeed, in all other countries where the rescue programmes have been acted or still operated, political forces and all rule parties had gathered together to implement the programme to which they agreed without rejecting their political or ideological autonomy.
This is why I believe that at the present stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions allows the country to go forward.
Eurowes: Your party was proclaimed in support of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the creditors of the country.
If you will be a new prize on Monday, will you perform this agreement, or will you try to change it at least?
In reality, we proclaimed Greece's movement on the European road, because we are well representing what pleasant consequences would bring out the countries of the EU.
Europe is now helping us by providing support to our farmers for their production, we have solidarity funds, Yunker package and assistance in the bank sector.
All this would be lost if there was no treaty with Europe.
However, the current stakeholders of the economy have become the result of the negotiations of Mr. Cyprus.
I know that Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants us to help.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government in the first year wants to rule, it works rationally and understood that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, so I surely all the commitments that cannot be taken because of recession may become a subject of negotiations, but only a certain time.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors because they are expected to completely implement agreements.
If we want to relocate their trust, we must continue to pursue, reform and structural changes agreed by continuing using the benefits of EU funding and large investment opportunities that we need to open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus did not submit any serious arguments on many key political issues that we have explained, discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give an example of farmers' revenues.
We have explained to our European partners that it is not about the fixed month income, and therefore it cannot be fully covered by taxes previously.
We said that the Ministers of Cyprus have never spoken about this.
The Greek ministers have not been prepared and badly informed, and therefore have negotiated and made an unsuccessful agreement.
Eurowes: If you win for elections, you will soon be on one table with Mr. Yunker, Olland, Mrs. Merckel and other European leaders.
Are you going to differentiate what you're telling to them, from what your predecessor Antonio Samuels said to them?
Evangel Maymarracis: First of all, I explain to them that until the end of 2014, we have tried to comply with the 2012 agreement with the strict edges in it.
We moved forward to reforms.
Of course, we did not have the necessary determination and speed, but we have acted in emergency circumstances.
The line fell, and it was not apparent that potential buyers were ready to pay the price of the Greek Government.
At that time, I was a parliament spyster, and I could agree to the opinions of the three parliamentary groups that were then the majority of the government.
In spite of their serious ideological differences on key law projects, we had a parliamentary, which is in the presence of popolists and extremists, as well as of massive demonstrations outside.
We could be able to make a country a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process was not stopped by the preceding general elections made by the Presidential elections.
Euroweek: The last week on the territory of Greece moves the massive river of refugees.
What do you think of this situation, and of the reactions of European countries in which these people are trying?
The enemies of Meimarracis: Crisis with refugees is a slow-ended action bomb, which we should have a case after the winning of elections.
And the reason that the Syrian Government did not act in this situation as it was.
In such matters, it should be inclined, because if you face the problem, there are only emergency measures.
And now we're in such a situation.
Even the temporary Government, the CYRZ changed, has done over seven days more than Mr. Cyprus for seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim Government, which provides valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, which calls for the EU Summit, will make a decision.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and note the unlawful immigrants.
These were the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some emergency events that have occurred with them.
This issue has a deep humanitarian aspect, and we will keep the position that European policies must take in this new situation.
This decision should be taken in the EU itself, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need the best coordination of action, more effective cross-border control and refugee reception centres.
We must also use effectively the economic assistance received from the EU to be able to address this poor problem.
Eurourones: Mr. Meimarracis, thank you for the interview.
The Evangelium: Thank you.

The man who discovered the gun at the University of Delta State left a note with excuses
After the shoot and murder of his friend in Mississippi on Monday, and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a record in which he said "congratulates" about the first murder and wanted to "too back", reported the authorized bodies on Tuesday.
The police in the city of Gotia, Mississippi, reports that the employee of geographic and public science at the University of Delta has called at 911 a.m. at about 10 o.m. in the service.
On Monday, he told him he shot someone.
Lamb said to the manager that the police had to send people home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he said that there's a "pocket" in the house that "no one's throat," but it probably was struck.
The police was interested in calling, but he didn't call it.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the fire.
When the police arrived in crime, there was 41 years of the body of Amy Prentis, and written by the Lamba's record, 45 years old, saying, "I'm sorry I would like to return everything.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
When the note was recorded, Lamb passed 300 miles to the University of Delta, where Itana Schmidt killed, a historic employer, and the lunch night, when he was around the police, he ended with her.
The Director of the University of William LaForge reported that he was not known about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “It was apparently aware of Mr. Lamba.”
In spite of the monthly information that the Lamb had proposed a roman between Princess and Schmidt, the official offices at Tuesday reported "no information or evidence" of the "a loved triangle".
Principes replied as a good man, Shawn O'Stin, who reported that she was married for about seven years.
They've been cut 15 years ago, but they've been friends.
O'Stin told him and Princess had a daughter of 19, and she was "assumable."
He added that Princess and her daughter were the best friends.
According to Lindsie Noux, the Sun Gerald newspaper called a close friend of Princess, recently worked out of home through the Internet.
Noulds told that Princess had a pleasant sweet for the Latining clip, and she met Lamb for about three years.
Nource said, "He always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called the parents at a moment on Monday to say that he wouldn't go to prison.
On the same evening, when the police shocked him on the shooting 1 away from Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, shooted out of it, fled to the forest and shooted there.
According to the summary made on the University Web, Lamb was received in the University of Delta's University of Pedagogic Science in the spring of 2015.
Stars who lost their luck
Atter (left), on a photo with her son, Redmond, right, survived a few difficult years.
In 2001, he was fighting with lyquemia, and in 2009 he lost his multi-year life satellite Farra Fosetti, who died from cancer.
As reported, the actor also suffered from drug independence and arrested him in 2008.
All of this, of course, has played its role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester in a few months because of a double break
Luke Shaw cut the right leg in two places during the Champion Championship shop, in which the United Nations played PSV in Andhoven.
While the protector is concerned about this matter which is not able to go to the field for at least six months, Louise Van Gal hopes that Shaw can play again in that season.
The trauma occurred during the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old show was shocked in the Strong Zone of the PSV.
He was helped in the field for nine minutes and gave oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a twice wheel, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be moved to Manchester tomorrow or day later and then operate.
This is a terrible young man who came to Manchester in 18 years of age, overwhelming great difficulties and playing fantasticly, and that happened here.
There was a oxygen mask on it.
He cryed.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double bar, it's six months, and the guy can't play in the group.
I hope he can play again in this season.
Morno was glad he had not received a red card and was not appointed to the toolbar.
Arbitre Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a mexican.
Van Gall believes that the Italian court had made a mistake.
Judge yourself when I say that it's to be the panel and the red card.
It was a very bad cock of two feet.
In your Twitter, Shaw writes: "Thank you all for your message, don't describe how devastated I have been, my way to rebuilt begins, I'll return stronger than it was."
On the other hand, Manchester United is concerned with Luke Shaw when ISS played
The Protector will be further encouraged to move to Championato of Europe in France on June next.
Phillip Cook, a PSV trainer, said, "This is a very hard trauma."
When any player elects such a trauma, it's all very disappointed.
This was never the purpose of our players to trauma the opposite.
Morno moved off the feet when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under the Van Gall leadership in Championete Mira 2014.
"He's now very difficult, because he didn't have a purpose to hurt the opposite, and when you hear that it's a very heavy trauma, you're feeling wrong," said Cooke.
I couldn't see the same moment.
The only thing I could see, it's a smoke that flyed in another direction, so that looked like he (Morone) was shocked, but I didn't see Luke's subcontract.
In the conversation with SBS6 Morno said, "I know what this is, I know how hard it is to be overlooked.
I'm very hard, and I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado from PSV was also added to the hospital after Christ Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorex?
Each parent is quickly exciting one thing: if your child likes a book, it's going to take a little time before you get to know it almost.
Let's see if you're not David Cameron.
In replying to the question of the representative of the group of children ' s disappearing company on his loved child book, the Prime Minister chose a statement with a environmental cycle written by Dr. Suzum in 1971.
This was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment published on the SuperCamps company, and continues: "This is a joyful, thrilling and unreasonable history with a strong message I love to read to your children, because it is always discovering some image or message that we miss."
And it would be good, except the last paragraph, in which Cameroon is prescribed, to report the content of the book, but in fact it is a single movie that was covered in 2012, with new persons and details added to develop a very short original event.
"In the surrounded walls of the city of Alliance, where no green and even air was sold for money, the boy, named Ted, hopes to bring the heart of Audrey - the girls of his dreams to see the actual tree," we read in the text of the description of a lovely history known by Dr. Suzu (the real name of Teodor Susan Gazell), who died in 1991.
If this seems unexpectedly, Cameron's text is almost read as a short post of the "Lorox" film, published on the Internet Movie Database website: "In the highest walls of the city, where everything was artistic and even air sold for money, the boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of Odry - the girls of his dream."
It seems unreasonable that Cameron, with a general recognition of an active parent, is so unconscious of the content of a book named a boy knows how it destroys the environmental detriment of the trees and the band of the "exhibition" Nacomingness, despite the Protests of Loraks (which has been made in the name of the book) is a sharp substance with the smell that speaks on the name of the trees.
Indeed, such an incomplete PR was assigned to a executive who has never read the Laraks book 20 times.
The representative of Dunning Street said that the text was intended to be obtained from Cameron's office in the election district.
The SuperCamps company confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameroon's stage, but it did not follow further comments.
For Adam Lita, it was obvious that it was a risk that was not in the collecting England, but it was still a complex issue.
The winning of Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is an unfair challenge, but if you look at the collection that England has chosen for this tour, the recurrence of the test series in the last three-0 series, I don't think to be believed.
I wouldn't be excluding the victory in my field.
The Alistair Cook team may have been less experiencing than three years ago, but there are games that are vulnerable and collective thoughts; they will not be shocked since 2012, but only a young man's position.
With Monen Ali, it is turned into a bowl that gives a handle meat, and Adile Rashid, even if he is unknown for the test level, is an attacking option.
On the other hand: Adam Lit was out of the assembly of England on the test cricket and replaced by Alex Hayes
The decision on the exception of Adam Lita to me, his main trainer at New Yorkshire, is difficult to analyze.
Two good attacks were in complex conditions, but the evident but cruel reality was that crystal games were evaluated by the judges.
There were no questions on John Ruth, for example, that the declaration had come to, because (and I have already said it) the games are best chosen to themselves.
A couple of fever, and Lita could wait for a more long carriage, but he was in his own court.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for New Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The main trainer of the assembly of England, Trevor Baillis, was well referred to his attitude, even when he didn't show what he could, and that's not surprised me; he's first the command game, and then the rest.
The question of how much time is to be before the band of the test cricket remains a complicated issue.
Lit played in seven games like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton had a chance to play in his and in the foreign field.
The only thing you could be grateful is that England has chosen Jonathan Treott for the Caribbean Prime Minister when Lit was in the best form, but this lost chance was already in the past.
It looks like Alex Hayes, and he's a bathsman I'm appreciated.
He's an unpredictable cricketist that we saw at the New York Club at the beginning of this season when he paid 236 masks against us in the Trent Bridge area, which was already something.
He must be provided at least the same time as those before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the OAE.
The museum put Mona next to Cook as an open band that would give the opportunity to introduce a additional snake, keeping four fast bottles, and I'm not going to do this.
I don't see the reason why a shooting player can't shoot there, and this legend has already shown that he's a good cricket.
Monan may not be exactly what he needs for his Wurstershire graph, but he became the third number for them, and there's no major difference here.
My old companion by the Jastin Langer played his first 38 tricks of tests before being opened in 2001.
He won three hundreds immediately and didn't look.
Zaphar Annari comes to the collection as a reserve snake, and my non-continuing society was shown to me as a very promising young man.
People can look at his example statistics — a mid-third and 35-wheel- — and think that it is a risked rate, but among the shuttings of the voters and the elections of the youth.
He's learning a lot in this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a pair of practical supplements in training.
The appointment of Mahera Jayawardin, the Sri Lanka Butsman, could be a master path.
He is one of the best guys for the game that brings the most richest experience in all possible conditions and any attacks.
Paul Colingwood is included in the games where the white meat is used, and is assured as energy as well as insufficient speed.
I always felt that he was born to be an international cricket, any game or training work, and, like Mahel, had a small intellect.
Sometimes new votes in the dispatch, even if they say what was already said, may bring new team forces.
Collega Colly, on the team of Darem Ben Staux, is left for one day, Ruth provides similar interruption in relation to Australia, and I, for example, have not experienced this problem.
Although not all of them agree, trains and persons who choose players do not determine the schedule.
And you should remember the games, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy.
The Championship of Foreigners from Europe may be able to win if the economy is in depression until 2017
The unplanned policy of David Cameron for the renewing of British maintenance negotiations in the EU is still more complicated every day, even without the election of Jeremy's genetic "no?" - the Corbine of the League League leader or TUC in Europe on Monday.
Foreigners also have their Corbine and Nigera Faragey.
The European Polish diplomat explained on the day that, in the situation now in which the EU is now concerned with different crises, not all of them own production - some countries participating in the British Economy Agenda of Sustainable Dispositions and Contractions, which they mainly do not want to change.
At Briton's annual meeting, the TUC decided that he would not, in any case, want to destroy social protection.
We could even call this "Dave and George's Silf Programme".
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are posted on the Samitas and bilateral sessions in foreign cities, photos themselves on the background of the known local memorandum, in the company of local representation or without it, and then come home and say that they join Unions to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be interested in maintaining external contacts under the tens of Eurowes - "Do not leave us together with France," says Berlin - proposes that the Ministers and officials in some cities be reached before understanding when they become the same, we stay or leave.
Angel Mercelle, a very careful officer in Germany, is an unity, but she has a ten-year-old office and wants to leave the office until the situation was worried for the persons who are sit in their place of Tatcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Cole (16).
Chapter of France France Oland is before the rechange or replacement in 2017.
He also loses strength.
Poland may soon receive the nationalist Government of the right touch, Spain, the left.
It is likely to see their skin useful to help the "great-britannical" whose energy could be lost to prevent Skotlandia ' s exit -- what they do not want, because most of them have similar separative trends.
Therefore, some of these ministers may even plan for the extradition of sNP in the 2017 Referendum campaign in Britain to support the EU ' s exit process, my friend.
"Idea Fix" and "Britannia has not received anything of the value from the renewed negotiations."
The Europeans know what the Flight Street could be, and how skeptically the EU's media magnets were established, unlike the period of Tony Benem report in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 to 2.1.
They can smilely remember Boris Johnson, a shocked Europorturist who glorified their "direct bananas" by the EU of the Brussels Corporation at the beginning of the 1990s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a pest company from the fearing jelly taxes, the phone hackers and the non-resident pseudo-residents who have most of our big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same view, but he gave himself a report that when you're in a cell with a boiled horses, you've got to give her the bananas to disappear it and not give her food to you in a channel and again with the tea.
In fact, Millibanando was the largest engaged by Biller, in contrast to Cameron's concept of referendum, because Biller had been the principles for the decent constitution of the EU, the chief French and the Dutch electioners in 2005, which gave him a winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him.
But my lady Jeremy Corbin, who had a friend of me in Westminster on Monday, I told him that he had no longer time to lose him for me - it seems to be a risk to repeat the "Boycot Mercoke" strategy from the 80s and then, and now.
This may take time, but he must develop a subsequent strategy for interaction with the press is not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marrom, whose guard was on Sunday.
The official position of the Corbine for Europe is that I are depending on evolution.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people in the border of the Ukip traditional trend and the larger circle of the "alarms of small English" could probably say "yes".
This is the same as Hilary-Ben, but not Bennett-Ben said to the radio and TV this week, with all its internal fighters refused to acknowledge that the appointment of the Corbine of John McDonald's "Tenive" Minister of Finance was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 70s when his elderman from all the TVs was struggling for the unfaithfulness of the colleagues in the Labourist Office, not too far and not losing his position in the Ministers.
The Bethva Hilary was more appreciative.
But fighting to remain "in any circumstances" is Ben's phrase not what, said McDonald's, and not what J. C. said to the parliament at a private meeting on Wednesday evening, in general.
In order to want to report the democracy and the "speak" Corbine - remember, he even triggered me - the disciplina of messages remains important at the circle television for seven days a week, and especially in the waterway of social networks, paralysis and pregnancy.
This is wisely to let Cameron not simply separate from Europe, allowing him to take the support of library library during the referendum campaign, as McDonell said.
Simon Jenkins's certainly thinking like that.
But the main mistake of McDonald and Corbine on membership in the EU, within the "bennitic" economy, is no longer the issue of an ezoteric discussion among the left dissidents, for which narcism that has been born in a minor difference, is a central principle in dogmatical discussions.
With regard to his wrongdoing on Nato-Tom Watson, J.C. will not act on the outcome - foreign diplomas will have to try to bring it to their leaders home.
Why is Paris or Berlin expenditure of political capital - they also have suspicious elections - when it can be unreasonable?
The United States have already been extremely disappointed by the weak military action of the United States in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the Government of the Trust has slowed expenditure, which I have recalled at Monday forum in a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize electronic smoke review from Public Health England
Declarations by the Government of the Agency that electronic cigarettes were less harmful than smoking at 12 persons, some of who are related to Taxi Industry, as reported by researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet have found evidence used by the Public Health Agency in their electronic cigarette report.
The PHE has published a significant report, the "returning phenomenon" in the last month, called it "international review of evidence".
However, some researchers made doubts of data reliability and indicated a number of experts with the taxi industry.
In a draft article in the Medical Journal of Lancet last month, the "excellently shocked" was based on the basis of which PHE has built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, more two researchers asked whether these statements were "supported or smooth foundation".
Martin McKi, the representative of the European Health School of London Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Caevelle, who provides clinical epidemiology at the University of Liberal University, reported: "The fundamental principle of health - the rules should be based on evidence of efficiency."
In their words, the public expects that the PHE declaration shows that "the best evaluation shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than smoking" were based on a detailed selection and modelling.
It is actually the only meeting of 12 persons to develop a multi-critical analysis model in order to make their views relate to the damage related to different nicotinated products; the results of the meetings are briefly presented in the scientific publication.
MacKi and Kipwell reported that one of the meeting publishers was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose Director-General was reported that it had previously been financed from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also reaffirmed the BAT certificates in the health report on sustainable development.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced the financing of the e-smoking producer, not mentioned by the financing he had previously received from the tax company Philip Morris.
The wise explanation of the members of the Council was not provided, but there are among them a number of known electronic cigarettes, some of which also declared the financing of the industry in the publication.
It is unknown if there are other participants who have experiences of management in the Taxi.
The meeting also visited the manager of the Taxi Guide in the PHE.
The study article, published by the group, "speakly agrees" with the lack of "weapon evidence of the harmful impact of most of the products in most criteria", wrote McKi and Caepwell.
However, no of these connections and limitations have been covered in the PHE report.
McKi and Caevel told that the PHE statements “in the present time no evidence that electronic smokes are a road that brings children or non-smoking.”
Prof. Kevin Fronton, Director of Health and welfare in the PHE, said that BMJ's statements had already been answered.
He said: "Electronic smokes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two smokers died because of their injury.
All evidence understood that the threats to health from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study remote consequences.
The PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what proves and what does not prove, especially where the publications had doubts about the relative danger in comparison with the taxi.
About 800,000 people die each year from smoking diseases, and smoking is 2 billion feet per year.
It is clear that, although electronic smokes are not safe, they are only part of the damage caused by smoking - we do our tasks towards the nation.
The former chapter of the channel 4 believes that BBC company should stop the EastEnders series
The former chapter of channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop the explanation of programs such as EastEnder and The Voice, noted that their business competition competitors would give a lot to the successful shows, as well as the "The Albert's Programme".
Johnson noted that licence collections should be used only to create programmes that were not issued by other British telecommunications.
He expressed the criticism of the BBC that the company was being transferred to a public advertising, which must be viewed only a small part of the audience at a short time when competitors go to show with high racing, and on channels like BBC4.
After the Director-General of BBC Tony Holl said that the company would like to cooperate with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had tried to work in his six years without succeeding with BBC during its work at channel 4.
"I can't divide from the idea that BBC is ready to start and translating transfers that could show competitive companies without subsidies," said Johnson to members of the Lord's Communications Committee in the course of the further BBC court.
If you keep the licence collection that I do not consider a good decision in a medium and long-term perspective, the company should leave only the programs that are not issued and will not be issued by other companies.
Shoo The Voice comes in a slope, because the creators want to receive maximum support for the future.
The idea that nobody more shows it, is funny and clearly absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regulatory taxes should go to the financing of transfers that could be paid without subsidies.
The Voice is one of these examples, EastEnders, and it is generally known that they are their own production.
Other channels, of course, would be given a lot for it.
I don't understand how this can be a public advertising.
I don't think it would be a BBC.
A series of Johnson company, launched by the Cannel channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC in shooting "towards the ammunition of staff and because of their faith that it is the best way to prevent the duration of the duration".
His comments on BBC's most popular shows are called with the comments of the Executive Director Sky Toni Bolla, who proposed the BBC to sell East Enders series in its study of MacTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003.
Johnson noted that the lower transmission of BBC public " continue to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate audience, but the company's function is carried out, and it may be predicted as a argument for the Canadian preaching that justifys the revenue of the licensed collections at 4 billion feet: "No, of course, we do all these unreasonable transfers that no one looks."
They're putting them into the shooting where no one will never see them.
With regard to the licence collection, Johnson reported to the Committee: "I call for you to find a more registered system with regard to whom more will be obtained from it.
Of course, you're all thinking we all think that 150 pounds per year is a great amount, but for people whose 150 feet are large money, they're interesting, because they're not really looking and listening to BBC.
The former Executive Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke before the Committee on Monday, said that BBC should review the mission of Rita for information, education and development.
He noted that only a small part of the BBC material is formally classified as educational, it is 1 per cent of the television content and 0.1 per cent on the radio, and that the company must hold the initiative of Australian and Canadian publishing companies under the nine "Information, education and development".
On the partnership, Elsten noted that BBC should make more efforts in the fields such as the Promised Contracts (e.g., in his words, 'TV') and enter the Alliances with commercial advertising companies to make them available to the online review.
Sonogenetics allows to control the brain cells using sound waves
The video shows that nomates change the direction of movement at the time they affect sound impulses.
Scientists have produced a nerve with a genetically modified nervous system that can be managed using sound waves.
The raw nemates change the direction of the movement at the time they affect sound impulses, too high that human ear can hear them.
Impuls have effects by activating neurons genetically modified to use meubling channels that react on ultrasonal weathers.
Furthermore, researchers have managed the brain through light
The scientists told that the skin showed the possibility of a new method called "sound genetics " which means the use of an extraction to recovered certain brain cells, heart and muscles, and the source of ultrasony is outside the body.
Sricant Chassani, a Scientific staff at the Solca Institute, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this method could once be replaced by a deep stimulation of the brain, a invasive procedure in which human brain sends electrical impulses to Parkinson's disease.
Red-Natoids usually did not react to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in the liquidity containing microscopic pushes.
He found that the powders increase the ultrasonic waves that then fall in the snake body.
Strengthening ultrasonal weathers affect the structures called TRP-4 channels, found in the memorans of some raw cells.
The vultrascover waves put these yon channels to open and up-to-related cells are reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to create non-mathods that can be managed through the ultrasons, Chalasani made genetic changes to the wheel, so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 channels.
During the use of the ultrason for the impact of the modified organisms, the sound waves have increased microscopic pushers and have been introduced into the raw organisms by intensifying modified motor neurons.
This method is similar to the new direction used in "optogenics" which allows scientists to include and exclude neurons through light impulses.
Chalasani argued that, compared to this sonogenic method, there may be some advantages.
Unlike the light that is provided to the necessary part of the brain on the arsenal, the low-scale ultrashore flows unprecedentedly through the skin of the body, so it does not need to pass within the corner box.
" We believe that, in order to treat some non-urological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of genothertherapy and therapeutic virus can make human nerons feeling towards an ultrasonal signal, " said Chassani.
He adds that, moreover, the methodology could apply to muscle and insulin cells.

Advertising statements are issued on the British arms trade
See the role of Amnesty International with protest against the exhibition of weapons.
Awesome drones killers!
Destructive weights of iron candles!
Casey bombs!
Electrical light-shoes, which causes unexpected pain, but don't leave the sequences!
A strict voice and availation are not doubtful that this advertising of the greatest international weapons exhibition - the epoch of Amnesty International prepared to focus on the goal of the British Government ' s repressive weapons, using the EXCeL centre in the Dominican Defence Technology and Security Systems.
Another subject: DSEI arms exhibition: Authorization regimes are coming to London
However, a special campaign has also resulted in an emergency exhibition of numerous bus stops and trains that are required to see them again.
"The important declaration from the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them by the London Metro fonts with the image of the DLR line that turns into force in the dance.
In September this year, the trafficking traders struggle at the DLR line. Passaggers ask for help to prevent the exit of weapons.
300 posts are described by artists who have made their work in the "Large Design Mouse" in the Bank's Desmaland Park.
The Collection, called the Group, helped to distribute them to London by using the "Public Detection" of the 6-four host keys, which, as it is said, "assums nearly three advertising spaces on the planet's bus stopping."
Londra's transferers were unlawful of such "vandalism" as an unlawed warrant.
One of the parish statements issued by the Group on the Pattern.
According to Gavin Greendon, a smoker of Cruel Designs and providers at the University of Escoce, artists are more demanding and are trying to bring political art to the audience outside the gallery.
Many artists start to work with protesting movements by understanding that they should be in real peace for their art if they want to influence society.
Another testimony against the exhibition of weapons welcomed by passengers in the metro.
Amnesty's video was reviewed more than 1000,000 times per 24 hours on Facebook and created a VCCP worker with a graphic designer and a sound artist that also works freely.
The creative Director of the VCCP Matt Lever was inflicted by an advertising weapons exhibition - with a loop in the ExCel Calendar, and said: "We shall make them a campaign that they are trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and guitropistic corporate advertising, but "completing her home with light colors and animation has become more enthusiastic."
"They were incredibly helping us to focus on the sale of illegal torture equipment on exhibition," says Tom Davis from Amnesty.
Now, we need to ensure that the Government of the United Kingdom has taken measures and ensured that this torture equipment will not be legally sold directly to our face.
It may be the most creative art for the exhibition of weapons, where the participants are fantastically equipped.

Eight gold rules of residence in students
11 years ago, since I moved to the student as a normal 19-year-old man, still believed in beaches and moral religiousism, but now I remember the smiling smile of those who I disappointed - and many long-term complaints on others.
On the basis of what I learned, I can put it on eight simple rules.
The normal movement may vary from the light of the nervous to the absolutely scary.
He encourages me to tell people where you're taking a academic department and where you're going to support Corbine and why you're "right, nor love, nor Marmith," because, seriously, it's just a red extract of Hahahaha, I'll be on yourself."
Respirate.
And help others to smell as well -- give questions and show interest.
This supports conversation and helps you to find people you like, not those with whom you wouldn't even have spoken, even if you had a race, but they would have disappeared the fires.
Let's get people out of space.
People are often transformed into sweet, medium-sized cinema and general swimming places, but they are also the place where people are sweet and run down whites.
Another question: Don't even think to start learning at the university, in relationships
Introvertants in universities are unfair.
Your room must be refugees, but many communities form a styling culture from one room in another, which contributes to friendship, society and leads to debt friendship.
This may be a goddamn man who tries to restore the power.
Nothing in the culture lets you say, "You like me, and I want to keep friends with you, but I need you to go, and I've been able to restore the energy I've lost for communication with you."
Just try to feel when a competitor is cut into society -- and not to shoot him, but to send SMS.
But about the stage, do this.
One man in my community followed the principle: if the door was not closed, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Take your friends with smells.
As you are starting a university life at the shoe of Bake-Off, you're shooting into the doors to imagine and shoot a shooting shooting shooting, that's not so strange in the 1950s, it's not likely to remind them, "But welcome, we're neighbouring, and I'm just going to smile to you, and I'm going to give you personal questions."
Propose home rental is a good way to get married.
Your neighbors will feel that you should be sick and that your face may be associated with them with a nice surprise.
It's definitely depending on how good you're.
The soft cows, grain and grain will make people smell when you're going to smell them.
Eating is a typical crime in students.
You know, the shooting of some smokers is a shooting, but it's a smuggling thing to take yourself a little milk for the chea?
You're going to be the owner of the milk.
Maybe he'll suggest you not to smile, even if it's inside the wrath.
If someone smells your things, it's smelling, and I feel you, but try to get away from this adult than my neighbor who puts the milk into the milk for the shooting to detect those who took it without question.
Now she's in prison.
You don't have to make a sound that will prevent people to sleep or learn.
It's not just to be a good man, but because you're the same people from the conversation on the shoot house.
The girl in my core asked the neighbor to kill the blue and the bashitar sound as three hours in the morning, and she's in the morning.
In response, the neighbourhood increased the volume.
When he was finally quiet at 5 o'clock, she enabled him to sleep two hours, and then shoot her music and closed the door to the three-time test.
Wasn't it romantic if your future mate lived in the same community as you?
On the contrary, it wouldn't be an emergency, even if you're taking a neighbor for your future mate, cut into them, strike up a relationship, and you should see him every day, and maybe look at how he moves to your side all your common friends?
Of course, you don't get your heart - but if your neighbor is perfectly not your future mate, make it easy to cover your own skin.
When you understand that someone left the keys inside your slow room, the slight between the shooting and the smell more thicker than it seems.
It's a good player, but it's turning into its contradiction for the seconds considered.
Precious and interesting security lesson, hidden something, but never pack any of the dog patch and shampook rooms.
Out of the foreign door and leave the keys in the stainless water that you're then put into the shooting, but don't get the other things with Blu-Tack two times to the slope.
IOS 9: as to set a new operational system to iPhone after Apple update
The new operational system can be invited to select General, and then to be the software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to scan it and install it.
Some were faced with problems after the installation when the error reported to them that the "newing of the application could not be able to".
To avoid this, users should be recommended or waited until the survival is stopped or try to update through iTunes.
The phone instructions will allow you to go all the process to the end.
The process may include the removal of appliances to increase the freedom of place, but Apple had minimised the possibility of this action by reducing the size of updates, and also facilitated implementation with a special notification that proposes to remove the applications and to re-establish them once the process ended.
You should be sure that when you update your phone is loaded or is close to your loaded device so that you don't let your battery switching.
If the apple is too low, it will stop updates because the phone orders in the process may lead to a bad update.

Washington responded to the military activity of Russia's phone call.
The Secretary of the United States, John Kerry, called his Russian colleague Sergey Lawrence to discuss the situation in Syria.
He believes that the military support provided by the President of Asad only leads to the distraction of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House will not speak to the Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
The Secretary of the United States, John Kerry, called the Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Lawrew to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This reports the PJ Media publication.
The Secretariat clearly understood that the further support of President Assad from Russia is to create a risk of distortion and proliferation of conflict, and it is also negative to our general goal - fighting with extremism - if we also do not continue to concentrate on the ways to pursue the Syrian conflict through the direct transmission of the authority,” stated the representatives of the United States Department.
They also noted that Kerry had regularly emphasized the commitment to the United States to combat the “Islam State” in the framework of coalition from over 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of her.
Furthermore, the United States "we will join Russia's constructive role in trying to oppose the Islamic State".
The past Friday, the representatives of the White House said they did not exactly know what Russian armies do in Syria, but Washington will discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, the secretary of the White House Josh Ernett noted that the time for a phone conversation between the President of the United States Barack Obama and the Russian leader of Wormburg Puttin was until it began: "When the President decides that the phone conversation with President Putin will go to the benefit of our interests, he will spend a pipe and try to make the call. "
Barak Obama itself believes that Russia's decision to increase the support of the Asad ' s scheme.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Puttins four or five years ago when I told him that it was an error that the further support of Asad will only worse the situation.
"But he did not listen to my warnings, and the situation was worse," said the President of the United States.
The aircraft shall be released from customs payments.
The mine development is intended to temporaryly release aircrafts and other swimming means to relax and sport from customs and tax payments.
The Ministry for RF Government ' s mandate was prepared for the changes in the list of loan goods.
This reported the Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Lashina.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister RF Dmitriy Meddev, on the results of travel in Cloma, appointed a number of mining states in the Minnenium Development, the Ministry of RF, the Miniculture, MIT, IFS, FIB, the Russians to prepare a proposal for the establishment of a favourable conditions for the coastal areas of the country.
Experts, on their part, noted that the main problem is the absence of infrastructure for safeguarding, services and ice content.
The authorities prefer to store their courts outside the border — €2,200 million per year in the complaint of European States for the maintenance, repair and services.
The Russian Mine Development Development draft decisions by the European Economic Commission on changes in the list of goods temporaryly shipped with full conditional release from customs payments, taxes, which provide full conditional release from customs payments, taxes and other loans for department and sport.
The Ministry's view, of course, will help the establishment of favorable conditions for the development of the iceberg in the coastal areas of the country, said Lashina.
This issue was addressed to the subcommission on customs, non-aliff regulations which protected measures in the external trade of the Government Committee on Economic Development and Integration held in September, and to the outcome of the discussions were also accepted by states.
As noted by the representative of the Middle Eastern Development, the measures proposed for full conditional release in the aircraft are in fact loose.
As a result, after the adoption of the protocol of the subcommission to the Government of the Russian Federation, the European Economic Commission will make a proposal to debate with the EEA Member States, explained Lashina.
The list of imported products, which are fully released from customs payments, taxes, include goods necessary to facilitate external economic activities and international cooperation, to apply in science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, to provide international assistance and to them, and to provide service equipment (personal computers, machinery), control and medium-sized devices, burning equipment, spectacular costims and decorations, moved labs and masters, water-goods, mobiliary, machines, machines, machines, newspapers, newspapers, newspapers, and journals.
In the press office of the Ministers RF, Izwigs said that they had prepared compulsory arrangements on marine ports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yeltas, Feodozos and Euphaters, which provide a simplified order for the formulation of the swimming and exit of small, sportive and passenger courts in the sea port.
The mining is given to the Captains of the sea ports of Crema to ensure the simplified scope of small, sportive and passenger courts in the sea port and the outcome of the seas-sized courts from the sea port.
The Ministry has also been prepared by the projects of the RF Governments on the approval of the borders of the Cruma sea ports.
With regard to Yelt and the Federation, the rest of agreements have already been adopted, noted in the press of the State.
The view of the Ministers, oversight, classification and observation, the hospitalization of small-mean courts used in non-commercial purposes should be implemented by the Republic of Cross and Sebastopol.
The problem is that Russia has been extremely difficult with eggling because of the weakly developed infrastructure.
If we look at the south of Italy and France, it is a constant development industry in which a large number of people is involved.
In Russia, it's actually all on the place.
Our coast is the Black Sea in Sochi, Helengica, New Russia, Anapha.
But the great complexity of this area is that the rules of border service are extremely strict: to go through the edge, the masses of permission must be formed.
Moreover, in Russia you're even going to make anywhere.

With regard to the location for icehouses, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special angels for ships up to 30 hours; the ships also send to guard in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.

The World Bank has paid Ukrainian credit for $500 million.
The World Bank adopted a new project for Ukraine for $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This reported the press service of the international organization.
" The new financing supports a number of priority measures to reform in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine", says the report.
The Director of the World Bank on Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine stated that the reforms of the banking sector would help to restore credits in real economy and to encourage the restoration of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken the impressioning steps for economic reform and the World Bank observed the first sign of stabilization.
However, because of the serious problems of Phane, the Government of Ukraine calls for rapid reform.
Previously, the Polish Government has approved the allocation of $100 million of Ukrainian credits, transfers "New News".
In prisons are requested to create separate blocks for transgenders.
The General Council for the Implementation of Criminal Sanctions (FSI) on the Protection of the Rights condemned in October 2015, including other issues, discusses the establishment of individual blocks for transgenders and transferers.
In this regard, the members of the Board of Vladimir Grub told the Council.
He believes that, depending on the general number of convicted in Russia, non-specific prisons, individual cameras, blocks, or even (if such crimes are much) may be able to create a special colony for trans-sexuals.
However, Vladimir Grub stressed that to determine the punishment of citizens in such isolated places only after the condemnation of the expertise that would prove that the criminal is a person who identifies himself as a representative of the anti-pollution field.
He has made sure that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of restraint punishment.
In his words, the proposed practice has successfully worked: the AIDS (in which the accused persons are before the court), individual cameras for transgenders and the corrective institutions are special blocks.
This is the only way to work with such criminals today.
Similarly, they must be excluded, since the presence of transferers and transgenders in ordinary cameras is dangerous for them, the suffering of their families and the marine problems for FIND staff.
The decrease of transmissions from the cocamerists is guaranteed, said Vladimida Grib.
Depending on how large it is, the number of criminals with an indefinite field, need to consider where to distribute them.
SIZO needs not specifically only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yeah, a separate column is possible if transgenders are much.
According to the report of the Group, 50 or 100 persons can be found in the block, and if the specialized corporation is created in Russia one, the punishment of the prisoner transsectors will be able to be sentenced from any regions.
The citizens are in the AIDS on the place of crime, so the income of transfers or transgenders from other actors during the investigation and judicial process is unreal, and this is the case to introduce such practices for the already convicted in a single colony, yes, it is considered by the Group.
Remember, the law enforcement officials were not able to decide on the case of a police isolator, a man or woman, to determine the detention detained for the 24-year-old drug transsexual Dmitri Coyuki (known under the name Alin Davis), because the man with the girl's outside arrest was not arrested.
He was out of his home under the sign of the invasion.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and media, since the transgender content mechanism in the AIDS and the columns in Russia was really not possible.
The Russian Ombudsman, LGBT Activists (LGBT - Lesbians, gee, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nicolay Alexev supported the idea of establishing special places for the punishment of transgenders, noted that, on the displacement, people could also be defined in the colonies of husbands or women, depending on their own desire.
In view of the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is right.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, as well as the security question for homosexuals, says Alexandr.
The prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be done on behalf of this and for homosexuals, so that they are more in prisons than transgenders.
In that regard, Alexandre is doubtful that Russia has been a number of citizens who are willing to take up the transceptuals because they are different from the ordinary colonies.
Of course, you can introduce medical expertise before you place people in the colony for transgenders, but it is not always the same.
For example, one of the prisoners in the United States seemed to be a man, and already said in prison that he wanted to change the gender, said Alexandre.
A man may feel like anyone.
But as far as certain places for transgenders are clear, I doubt that the prison officials will think about the security of such people and avoid their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, the international experts on reproductive health in the territory of the RF Boris Lordkipanye noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsectoral crimes in the colony could delay the start of the punishment of the convict.
The Commission is a sex, a psychiatrist conducts long-guarding issue, not a test based on a high-specific conclusion.
Today, psychiatric opportunities are enabled.
Therefore, before a different range of potential patients are always expertise - they clearly show that the change of the field with a surgical interaction is necessary - says Lordkipanidee.
However, I'm hard to imagine how this system is to be introduced in relation to the convicted, as the medium-term survey goes to the month.
The doctor, despite the general idea of establishing individual transsexual blocks, is also doubtful that in the current economic conditions, it would be appropriate to provide resources for the construction of new places, medical experts, transgenders in Russia.
No official statistical statistics have been complex, but if we consider that Russia's homosexuality is about 5 per cent, it can be said that transgenders are still less than and those who have such a rejection and even committed crimes are incredibly slow, said Lordki Panidy.
Now, as a request for the administration of the Homosexuality column, transgenders, and this can be obtained in individual conditions.
Mikhail Antiopus wins a younger world champion.
The Championship of Peace on Shahmats has been completed in Huntza-Mansik for 20 years of university.
The first end of the convent has been more than an enthusiasm.
The winner was just determined in the last tour, and the Russians Mikhail Antiows became a Russian, who was shocking the Yan-Kshishitofa Dudu pool, who would certainly go to the title.
At the winning, Natalia Bux was celebrated by the Ukrainian shakmatist.
The Championship of the Peace on Shamats since the beginning of September in Hantas-Mansik, which was already at the middle of the tourist distance, seemed to have perished almost all the flexibility, since the representative of the Polish Yan-Kshishetof Dud, who had issued a series of four winners (13 Switzerland systems), was certainly able to retain the leadership.
Bearing in mind that Dud was the first rating of the Favorite, it was, in fact, one of the most promising young shakmatists, the probability that he would leave the retreat, represented a very few.
And even when Dud was able to defeat and let Russians Mikhail Antipoo to reduce the displacement of 0.5 balls, he remained obvious in the fight against the title.
The Antipoulos had to win in the 13th tour immediately.
But it wouldn't even help, win Dud to your party.
Instead, this obligation of victory could, of course, be said to the game of the Russian shamachist and bringing to uncompensed errors.
Happily, Michael Antioch was able to avoid them.
He certainly met Francois Rambaldi, after he was deemed to wait when his party was completed by Dud, who met Benji Bok.
Happily, the Poland shakmatist had confronted the Hollands with the slaughter.
Thus, Antioch and Duda provided the same number of points - 10 of 13 possible, but Antico had the best additional indicators.
That is why he is the leader of the Hanta-Mansian autonomy district, whose Governor Nathania Comaru, traditionally focused on the development of shamat in the region.
And there was no enduring end in the slaughter of the girl.
The leader of the Tourism Nationale Buxe (Ukrainian) was not enough to lose the title in the last tour that she had succeeded and done.
So the winning of the Russians of Alina, the Bible, did not let her go to Bux.
The Russian sport has remained second with the disappearing of the champion in 0.5 ball.
It changes the regional structure.

At first they wanted 17 per cent of the index, now they want 10 per cent, and even multimillional subsidies from the budget, said he.
We say, it's too much, it's too much, it's too much, it's going to be less costs, learn to economize, turn away from the precious specialities, football teams, your own TV, stop expending money on the left and right.
He added that the FAO had its "wise more strict" proposals that are now discussed in the Government.
Polymetal considers the possibility of non-related calculation with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of implementing a total of $300 million, reported to the gold-contracting company.
In that case, Polymetal should be paid to $80 million of Sumeru (the difference between the expenditure of Sumeru and the market cotton), which may be taken from a free currency flow.
Sumeru has time to 3 October to make options or needs of payment.
The details of the negotiations in Polimetal are not opened.
The option was concluded in the purchase of the Kissazil Project in Kazakhstan.

Comfort rate for investment is 10 to 13 per cent.
As a result of experts, small and medium-sized business credit market in January-April this year was 40 per cent.
What are your estimates the situation today?
After the panic events of the end of 2014-in the beginning of 2015, the amount of credit was significantly decreased.
It is understanding: slightly increased rates.
The estimation of 25-30 per cent of the year was not benefited.
If the bank could impose all its possible problems in advance, from the time to the transfer, it is not possible to do this now: taxes and so worthy.
For the business, the current IFB credit rates are incompatible.
For a significant part of the investment projects, the current level is inacceptable to their purchaseability.
Tax level 10-13% would allow business to invest in a wide project spectrum and to form an appreciative income.
How does your estimates satisfy the request for enterprises for credit?
After the CB reduction, the situation was a little improved.
Main resources were more accessible.
However, as we observed, customers have been insured by credits.
First, businesses do not understand the prospects of their development and future income.
Today, the business is one way: we need to learn to work on the current economic situation in the country and in the region.
We need to monitor the current results and monitor the movement of money.
At the same time, new technologies should be used to modernize equipment, reduce production and energy security costs.
All of this, finally, allows the company to make the production more competitive and to maintain business even in an instable economic situation.
What main trends will IMS credit market strengthen and will affect its development until the end of 2015?
Is the rate of percentage changed?
Medium-sized rate projects will be depending on the Central Bank policies, and the regulator now demonstrates that key rates are reduced.
However, the radical decline of credit prices for ICB should not be expected.
The current situation of the problem is, first of all, an inflation that makes the necessary increased rate for real income.
Furthermore, the cost of money in Russia remains high even when the CIA rates are reduced.
In the case of the duration level, the traditionally small and medium-sized enterprises that are limited to the extent of money, as well as the adjustment of economic behavior, will, of course, represent a larger risk for creditors.
I wouldn't have been expected to reduce a significant amount of bad credit.
The main reason is the international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy of the country.
New Mazda C-5 and a perfect mode.
That is the word of Mazda by the Japanese jerome.
Red, laconic, and simultaneously very complex for those who are close to the cyliline or the latin.
Like the new C-5 crystal, as well as any other brand model: without ambitiousness lifted outside, technically done inside.
The Japanese simply, in force of its "approximity", can be able to fulfil the bonds of the Star of the sun before the Status of Full Training.
You can give arguments to the use of cars from other countries, and a person even agrees with these arguments, but the whole conversation is disappeared from the final expression " but this is the Japanese car!
You're not talking about anything!
Such people probably should love not only the technician, but also all other Japanese.
To quote from Bases, to administer youaby's food, to collect the catalons and to get your friends - no, no, no, no, of course, but on the canon of the Japanese modern mode: nice, creative, and very unexpected.
I am glad that the Japanese school form is the only form of which girls are pleased and after the school ended.
It has wonderful properties: at the same time, feeling and strict.
And as older girls, the sweet is shorter.
The main change in the external N-5 is the decision of the radiator with five horizontal lines.
But there is a stronger channel of a new fabric and the back of the front, where the car is now recognised in the stream.
As previously, Mazda Z-5 looks very conciliable.
The power is harmonized, the forms of feeling, but the externalness has a stress flow.
I don't have to call the police.
According to Rule N-5, one of the world's most safest, only a tranquillity in Japan can be experienced.
The dial engine of 2.2 l provides a high-speed moment in a wide speed range.
The fuel expenditure of this engine is composed of a power slightly automatic transmission and a full machine.
Black bones, black sweet, black sweet...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose liggens with a police legend of No Cross.
On the other hand, Mazda has made maximum efforts to not be found on the C-5 Rule.
In order to increase the competitiveness, the maintenance of this excellent management has been reconstrued in front and behind amortisators, as well as the form of the corners of the front markets.
The complete system is adapted under Russian conditions.
The sound level of roads and high speed engines reduced by 13 per cent.
The cobaltor in the flowers or shoes is lacking as the budget sedan.
Another case if a girl comes in a shopping room with a original picture.
For example, from the computer game in the shooter of a shooting shooting.
Attention to her then is not less than the new C-5!
The new C-5 building improved both the front and the back seats, which provides the optimal reserve of space and for wide pieces, and for long feet, who owns.
Another long-term estimate that the front of the central ton is now milk and not shocked by ships in expressions.
Mazda's most wide range of active security systems is proposed just at N-5.
In order to detect potential threats, there are radars, lasers and cameras.
There is an adaptive lighting here, and the warning of the east from the ground, and monitoring the dead zones, and safe movement.
Mazda C-5 is one of the best baggages in the class.
The load of a minimum expenditure is loaded by 561 l. The seat is a proportion of 4:2:4, each section is required by a single output market, and increases the bath sequence up to 1560 m.
The coast of the multifilm in Japan is called "cigurums".
It looks particularly sweet cygurums.
We can do it!
Of course I'm sleeping.
But it is still to develop small children.
Or just swim like that beast on the street...
It is so nice when there is a opportunity to choose — a good clothes, a manner of conduct or a car.
Thank you for the preparation of the Kawaicat shopping.
Kiev has disappointed the atomic opinion.
Kiev officially refused Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the construction of the EFSA.
The High Council, in the midst of the second attempt, still proclaimed for dismissing the agreement with Moscow.
The contracts on the establishment of the third and fourth blocks were still signed in 2010-2012, but the project could not be implemented.
In the Middle East, the Ukrainian Supreme Council adopted the Law on the Agreement with the RF on the Construction of the Third and Fourth Block in the Hmerney EEA Agreement 2010-2012.
The draft law by the Government of the country was only in the second vote, and the first time 210 Members supported it at the minimum of 226, but then 234 members of the parliament had been resigned.
The ESC HELN HELNEKA of the project was to contain four GWT energy blocks with WWR reactors, but only two have been able to build.
Debates with the Moscow on the Construction brought to 2010 the intergovernmental agreement, and the Council adopted relevant laws in 2011-2012.
As the funds in the Ukrainian budget were not intended to build blocks to the Russian party, but the resources were not allocated.
After turning to Kieve in February 2014 and the follow-up of the two Kiev countries, the relationship with Moscow in the atomic sector began to be engaged, declaring that it was refused to cooperate in Hmernico EAS and on the project of construction in Ukrainian nuclear fuel.
The single area in which the relationships remained, the carburant was purchased in the Ukrainian active ECA (of half of the energy processing in the country), as the Ukrainian electricity NAC was replaced by no Russian supply.
From the plans of the Hmelnika AEC with another contractor in Ukraine, it was not finally rejected: in 2014, the Kyoto Declared negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.

The OBSE reports on the possible meeting of the Ukraine and Russian parliamentary.
The Delegation of Ukraine in the Parliament Assembly (PA) OBSE Arthur Gersimom reported the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in South-East Ukraine.
"I know that a certain meeting this year may be planned between the Ukrainian and the Russian parliamentary delegations," said the ASS, Mr. Gerizimva.
He also called on to comply with the mining agreements and to “return to the normal lifelife of our countries”.
The question of whether it was possible at the time of the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamental level, in the Normand format, or in the form of a contact group on the PHA OBSE, Mr. Gersiem noted that the dialogue had been undertaken by mine agreements.
At the same time, according to the policy, any type of dialogue is supported in Kiev.
Previously, the representative of Ukrainian negotiations, the Ex-President of Leonid Kuchma stated that the self-proclaimed Donetska and the Lugan Republic had not changed their positions in tripartial negotiations, but the tunnel of the dialogue was more positive.
The parties divided mandates.
On the electoral committee on the Sub-National New York held the outcome of the elections in the urban vision, distributed 12 deputy mandates discharged on the party list.
Traditionally, many complaints against the violations during the elections were condemned by the representatives of the FCC, accused of the election in the "wappings of falsification".
No comments were adopted.

Two mandates of the CPRF are distributed between the Burundi Officer and the deputy of Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of the St. Russia are complemented by Alexandre of Rasmum, Yugoslavia of Goddan, and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates should be determined whether they will work as deputy in the city: in the case of the refusal of the mandate, he moves to the next party candidate.
The President of the Horizontal Officer Alexandre Macev informed the members of the Commission that it introduces the Delegation to "Send the Telegrams of Jyrine and Others" in order to refusal of mandates.
In the approval of the protocol on the conclusions of the elections of the representatives of the CRF, multi-based violations were declared.
The member of the horizontal vote with the right to a meeting by the CPRF Leonid Kruckoutsky suggested not to admit the results of the vote on the four districts No.21-24, remembering that the head of the Somalia Administration was closed to the Administration building where four surrounding commissions were placed.
There was no long time that the deputy of Mrs Hoss, the candidates, the observers, and the resonance scandal with the door of the Administration was shown in the television.
At the meetings of the surrounding Commissions, all observers and members of the Commission had the opportunity to attend.
They had stopped access only when the vote ended and the committees had not yet come to pay their bullets.
This was made to prevent different insurances.
"The head was then adjusted, and at all meetings the interested persons could be present," spoke the member of the mountain of the Natalya Andrew.
The communists expressed that more than four hours in the blocked Administration was illegally maintained by the deputy of the Ludmila Aristovian congregation, as a result of the statement in the investigation committee.
The opposition was also regretted that, at a number of WICS elections day, the urine began at 6 to 7 a.m. to be printed in the morning, putting the Bulletins for a periodic vote.
At that time, members of the Commission with the right to vote and observers have not heard, so they came to the beginning of elections at 8 o'clock.
The communists are convinced that in the morning prior to the opening of elections in the urine, they could uncontrolledly cast the Bulletins.
However, the mountain of election, which has already been considered more than 124 complaints on different matters, has not found any violations of the unlawful Bulletin.
The members of the Commission and the proposal for a colleague from the St. Russian Countries had not been supported by Mary Power through amendments of regional legislation to clearly establish the time to hide convergence with the voluntary voters who then fall in the urn.
"In your own initiative, please contact with the CIC," recommended Mrs. Alexander McGeev later.
At the end of the meeting of the Chairman with the voice accused, the members of the CPRF Sergey Samokin, who cried that the election would ignore ten complaints and strike out the formulation for elections.
"You're not here at the Mitingue, you're more careful!" - I'll be the president of the election.
The protocol was adopted almost unilaterally.

According to the documents, the parties were going to discuss the two questions below: whether they agreed that the seats for multi-apartments should be "needly deleted" and the housing and communal services taxes "before to 2020".
However, the legalist of the thoughts of Irina Mavor explained that the treatment of the Russian Communists was contrary to legislation.
The FedEx issue has a slight nature, a reduction in the 2016 prognosis.
FedEx was noted on the outstanding results of the last quarter, and the guiant of the service has reduced the annual arrival due to the fall of demand on road transport services and the growth of costs in its land transport unit.
The company also said that it was planning to take about 55.000 seasonal workers at the festivals.
At the same time, in the past year, FedEx reported that there would be 50 000 temporary workers at the festivals.
The share of its shares was about 2.5 per cent of the pre-released sales in 45 minutes before the opening of ships in the medium.
FedEx Corp stated that it was planned to pay $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year, which ended in the next May, that 20 percent less than previously.
The analysis suggested $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
In spite of the average rates of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and the increase in land transportation of heavy or guarity goods starting in November.
The company stated that it was still planned to increase expenditure in comparison with the last year by reducing expenditure, increased monetary income and online trade growth.
The Chairman and the CEO Fred Smith said that the company had “stablely worked with the weaknesses, compared to the prognosis, economic conditions, especially in the production and world trade”.
The latest workforce plans were announced on the next day after the competitive competitive, UPS, that they are planning to take up to 95 000 staff, about the number of workers taken in the past year.
For the quarter that was completed on August 31, FedEx paid $692 million, to more than 6 per cent of the year ago.
The share income was $2.42, nearly at the average $2.44 for the share carried out by Zacks Investment Research for 12 analytics.
Income increased by 5 per cent, up to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six analysts in Zacks were $12,23 billion.
FedEx had suffered in recent years from the fall in the international emergency transport sector, resulting in the lack of the increase in the currency income in its express transport unit.
However, the purchase blue has significantly improved the results in FedEx Ground.
The last quarter of land transport increased to 29 per cent, but operational income remained generally without changes due to the increased costs of large shipment and self-training.
The Express Transport Unit has received a higher income because of higher basic rates, while income in the carriage sector was decreased because of increased labour payment costs.
FedEx shares were slaughtered at $3.85 or $2.5 per cent by $150.15 at the time of opening.
They closed Monday, slowing 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the recursion of 11 June.
In the most expected for a few years, the Federal Reserve System will take two days this week for a 27-four feet table from the Honduras red tree, decided whether the key percentage rate is almost 10 years old.
At one time, a rich shocked room for meetings at two stages will depend on the sighted image of the United States.
The map is to recall that the President of the Federal Reserve System Janet L. Ellen and its colleagues should bring the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank has received a double order from the Congress: to increase employment in the United States and to maintain the stable prices here.
But since the Great Recesion, the federal system leaders acknowledged that there was a third non-registered mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate may be an unknown factor in a almost sponsorized decision announced in the fourth century, whether the United States economy has been ready to take place from an unprecedented stimulation provided by almost zero short-term rate rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show a reliable growth in the economy, recent stress on world financial markets can maintain and so careful leaders of the Federal System from adding valuability by raising the federal fund base rates - even only four per cent.
"Certainly, the market of work and inflation will become the first and most important object of consideration", said Lindsy M. Peeggs, the main economist of the Broker Company Stiff Nicolaus & Co.
"I think that if they were looking for a reason not to spend the rates that increased the incertitude around the world market enough to justify them to wait forward," she noted.
There is no consensus on what they do in the Federal Reserve System, which itself produces the financial market collection.
About half of the economists, recently revised Bloomberg, predicted the increase in the rate of the week.
However, the financial markets are expected that the federal system will be maintained, while the key indicator only shows the likelihood of a rapid switch of about 30 per cent.
This may lead to the market of actions if the federal system is raising rates, provided that those who make decisions do not strike the promise that the next increase will soon be increased.
On Monday, the Dou-Jons index was at 228.89 paragraphs, or 1.4 per cent, up to 16.599.85.
Availability was made by expectations that the persons defined by the Federal System's Strategy would leave a rate this week - said John Lonceki, the main economic group of Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It will be surprised if the federal system increases the rates at this time," he noted.
If the Federal Reserve System is doing so, "we must go far in the approval of their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so that they are not packed".
Other experts expressed that the increased rates could be towards the financial markets, as this would take incertitude to how the Federal System would operate.
Over the month ago, the Federal System seems to have tried to spend 0.25 per cent in this month, making the first small switch in slowly reliance of financial conditions, which could be reaffirmed that the United States ' s reconstruction was permanent.
Ellen declared early and early summer that she expected to increase the rate in this year, despite the complaints from the Liberals that the economic progress is needed.
Although new workplaces were delayed in August, the labour market growth was stable in this year.
The unemployment has reduced to 5,1 per cent in the last month, which is the lowest indicator for over seven years, and almost at the level of the Federal System considered full employment.
The rate of payment shows speed signs.
While inflation continues to be lowered by the annual central bank for 2 per cent, the Federal System stated that the key cause was the temporary effect of oil prices.
The economy "it can be achieved with higher rates and needs, taking into account the reduction in the labour market", noted Ian Sheferdson, the principal economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world have become shocked at the end of the last month, after China has paid their currency.
The average Dou-Jons-Index for Industrial Accounts slowed to a total of 16 per cent in May about the recursive value, as investors feared that the slowing of the Chinese economy could slow the world growth.
The dimension of its positions in this month, and the Dou-Jons index is now at about 10 per cent below the maïs higher value.
In order to guide the Federal Reserve System, the market recovery is more complicated with the unfair calculations of the rate of increased rate.
“In the absence of the financial markets and news on the weakness of China's economy in the past few weeks, they had been to shut up the hikes at this meeting” said Steven D. Oliner, senior researcher of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and the former official of the Federal Reserve System.
Now, according to him, they will expect at least a month to obtain more impact control.
"It is a great indetermination of the consequences of the American economy and they have almost no reliable data after the last events in China," said Oliver.
The health of the world economy does not include the main concerns of the federal system, and its techniques should not be taken into account in the decision-making.
The Federal Reserve System, however, became a world financial authority.
The impact of the Central Bank in recent years was great.
Only one mood from the then President of Ben S. Bernak in 2013 was that the Federal Reserve System could "speak" its money expansion, calling the markets over the world.
In the world where markets and economic systems are increasingly overcome, it may be expected that federal reserve system leaders will not only follow the development of events around the world but also consult with other Central Banks and experts to understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is "speak art than science," noted Zakari Karabel, director of the Investnet Inc, company employed by global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted in this month that, in the history of the Federal Reserve System, there were excessive reactions on the financial market, which seemed to be not related to economic principles.
Laker, who has the right to vote by the Federal Committee on the Open Market Chamber, was an example of decisions 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia led to the fact that the federal system had reduced its base rate to 0.75 per cent for three meetings, "inviting the limited identification impacts for growth in the United States," said Laker.
In the past year, the federal system has deleted these declines.
The Federal Reserve System should set up the first place for the stability only during large crisis, such as the market in 2008,” said Adam S. Pozeen, former member of the Bank of England Tax.
The last panic and nearly did not approach this level, he said.
"You wouldn't, of course, want to be in the situation when you fear the growth of the rates because the markets are worried," said Pozeen, President of the World Economy Institute, Peterson.
The Federal Reserve System Act continues to have a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and I do not think that the events should be overcome.

The hospital of Sergey Narşistan allows the United States to destabilize the situation in the Middle East so that refugees are crying in Europe.
According to the Interfax, he expressed this view to journalists in the Ulan-Bator under the sixth session of the parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE.
"I am not a conspiratory partner, but the question is question itself: is Europe not the final purpose of those who have destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?" he asked.
"Indeed, somebody had prefered and knew that the rivers of refugees, these unfortunate and deceased people, who are saved from death, would be in the well-being EU countries," he added.
The narcotic question was: "What many European political leaders have been expressed openly about the causes of this crisis, the wave of refugees, which are now literally ill with their countries?"
"No, the old European, with a rare exception, prefers to silence," he constituted.
The NATO believes that many European values and standards of international law are covered by Narkash.
"The Europe, unfortunately, has long and unreasonablely struck and struggled as the military samphome associated with NATO standards, and the moral ideas and the basic principles and standards of international law,” emphasizes the Spieder.
The Government ' s military and their loyally armed forms opposed murders, mainly from Islamics.
Later, the Syrian Government has joined a terrorist group of the Islamic State forbidden in Russia.
The United States supports the rebellious and anti-Assad, and IH.
The official Damascus believes that such terrorists are a terrorist.
The President of Syria called the cause of the innocentness of the West to Russia.
The claims of West to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
This opinion made the Syrian President Bashar Asad in the RT interview, the First channel, “Russia 24, NTV, Russia today”, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Asad, western does not adopt partners and sovereign States.

The scriptor of RF Sergey Narayan was called an invalid introduction of sanctions against parliamentars.
In this regard, he declared, speaking at the UNOBSE session in the Ulan-Bator.
We appreciate this as an invalid action as the value of the parliamentary diplomacy.

I was glad to win a couple of days.
The Champion of Peace on a easy atletic Sergey Suvenko.
This season can be called a triumphal for a 24-year-old swimming aircraft from Barnaul Sergey SUBENKOWA.
He was able to spend on his coronal distance of 110 meters with the barriers to win for Europe's command, to set several records, and to become the Champion of the world, which was first in the history of a dividend barrier.
In addition, recently, the Sporter winned the 2011 final stage of the Brazilian Liga, which was a third part.
New Publications asked Swedish to share the impressions from the coming season.
Sergey, isn't the season for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to go to World Military Games, which will go October to Core, and then I'll be thinking about relaxing.
Truly, I'm ready to go home now, in Barnaille, and being home is a very different condition.
It's easier than every week to move to peace.
You've told you that the bathroom is a loved year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a wonderful time.
After the primary season, the load of responsibilities will not be given.
You can be joyful, "slowly".
I'm sure you're gonna get out of here.
What about the stability?
All the seasons are special, positive emotions...
The slowness to the end of the season is always shocking.
And it's not important to do what he's done more is winning or playing.
Each strike is stress.
The permanent ships, the transfers, are not all that passes for the body.
You're physically and emotive.
But now, of course, I've got emotions.
I'm just happy.
At the time they finished the world champion in Peking, you're often back?
Yeah, it's okay.
You, journalists, don't let me forget this.
But in fact, I think that the bad one who lives in the old winners is cutting his successful fleet again and again.
It was glad to win a couple of days, and it's got to move forward.
The preparation for this wonderful season was very different from the adjacent?
I can't say that something was such a particular thing.
We've been ready to start in December, but the winter season I've missed.
It was trained first in Barnaole, then at the congregation, and then again home.
Everything's normal.
But with the trainer, I was able to try to go to a new level at which I wasn't yet.
Practically, the winter was experiencing the base.
They escaped a number of crews, trained the general physical training, including and burden, and we hidden the shoe.
Then we took the barrier training, and many have been employed.
How do the fighters say they follow?
I'm always trying to do this, well at the Internet era, there's no problem.
We looked at the winter champion of Europe, and in the barrier, all the swimming pools took the French!
I thought more: I need to do something to clean this company.
With each old age in this season, you've swepted and swepted the results.
Did that make sure?
I have all the last seasons that are about the same scheme.
Not that I run first 13,20, and then 13,50.
I'm always slowly cutting my shape.
The main thing you wanted to do is get away from 13 seconds.
All the work was focused mainly on that result.
But paradox is that you feel that you're ready to shoot, but the snacks are not always prepared.
How was it, for example, at the Olympice in London?
I, if honestly, tried to forget it immediately.
It was very good, really it could get away from 13 seconds.
Even if you repeated your best result at that time, it would be a blonde game device.
But it wasn't lucky.
Do you remember your first world champion?
What about?
It was in Tegu.
I wanted to get out of the final, it was a Maximum program.
And he went away from the morning in the pre-spot flights.
Then I realized that smelling and bringing a smell of heads is that there's no way to fly.
Two years later, the World Championship in Moscow was in the finish with the best time.
I remember my feelings before the decisive conquerment: I wanted to win the "good" already!
How can it be possible, developing a good speed, not losing the head, not disabled?
And this is the most complex.
We need to be very accurate, concentrated on the technician so that we don't get the barriers away.
I noticed that when you're not on the result, but on the process, it's very easy.
And the most chair when you're feeling that you're flying and it's all like yourself!
The real word, it should be.
Many of our attracts from the depths after the first serious success are trying to move closer to the capital.
Didn't you ever have such ideas?
The house's still better.
You don't imagine where I'm without my train, whom I need?
Maybe and good would have better conditions, but I'm trying to be satisfied with what I have.
Have you been together?
For 12 years, since I was in a light atletic.
Precisely, I trained his wife who worked with her children, and she already delivered me.
I started with a spot, and then shooted, three.
The child's multitude was when they met a snake, swimming along the place...
In 14, I tried to run with barriers, and I liked.
From the first time, the second adult rule was able to comply with the standards.
That's how it remains.
Didn't the fear of barriers ever be?
Sometimes it got to agree with them.
But there was always a lot of work on the technology.
It's over one shooting!
But there's nothing to do from this routine.
The technicians have to be able to shoot me on the night, I was shooting and fly through the bar.
Everyone who saw your seat in Peking claims that it was a very beautiful flight.
Thank you.
I like myself.
Normally I don't keep my shifts, and I couldn't stay here.
But the effectiveness needs to continue to work - there is no limites of perfection.
Don't you worry now that the winning for year before the Olympic Game is on a hard load?
In such cases, I try to justify expectations.
Once you chose this way, it's supposed to go to the end.
My trainer likes to repeat: if you're not weak, no additional smell should feel.
And I'm totally agreed with him.
Lamb Kushanashvili
But not so much I'm going to make me aware of the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are buried, I understand their bread isn't smelling the enemies.
And even though I didn't have a fleet, and that's exactly the same thing, a million times I spoke here, and nobody called the shooting, it's a different job.
All my pseudonyms are shocked in seconds.
Pressing I'm being so strong that I even, the kind of a couple, thinking that people are white.
It's going to go, go, and it's on you, and it's gonna smile.
But you have to know me, I'm not a room oral, I'm a sweet, I'm sweet, I'm old, guys, I'm afraid.
Another matter is no support.
I didn't have such illusions, but now...
I've always been self-sufficient, so you're doing it.
And to give passports to such kinds like Fred Derst or Monson, they're just shooting.
I'm better, the better journalist, I'm worried.
A week ago, in Kiev, Dakar Kushanawili, crymical events were occupied:
What were done with the Cross Mediterranean is a crime.
That's what they call an anonysis.
I believe that the reference to the extensive Crochet tried to sign anything, nor in any case is inscribed in the general image of human society.
It's how to come to the neighbor and take him home...
The war from Kremell went, and she's finished only there.
I was almost 100 per cent sure that, as the summer of 2008, she started from the call of some shooter from the shooter of Kremell.
I've got a proposal who could be...
It's not so long and much to live.
I don't understand, he's the biggest artist, why he's supposed to smell his hands.
Is he losing the apartment?
Well, get him a memory.
Of course, people recalled him as a distressing family.
And the reconciliation now depends only on the Lord's ruler.

But when we met Sarah Macey, Sleece Marscocky and Lana Jevons-Fellose on the day when three girls have to stay two, they may have given a statement about the winner.
Sam Wood slowly keeps silence to the finish that will be on Thursday.
All three women are in a liry man, telling why Wood is a perfect man mentioned in this regard, integrity, family values, life-relatedness as reasons for each of them would be happy to become his satellites.
But their answers to the question "If you don't, who should have been the last whale?" they could not be able to figure out who of them actually had the heart of the Holocaust.
Jevons-Fellos and Marscocky were uncertainly called McKey a perfect couple for Wood.
Among Sarah and Sam since the first day, good relationships have been established.
"After I went into the number of participants, I felt energy (Sala) and Sam's energy and understood that they were very close to each other, and during the shoot, I was not doubtful of this," said Jevoness-Fellos.

Joffrey Haen had a number of options to start carriage in the NFL.
Detroit and Sittle were very interested after his movement to the United States, as well as many other clubs who sent requests after the impressed train day at the end of the last year.
But Haen elected San Francisco 49ers and train Jim Tomsula, and it seems to be a wise decision.
Some trainers would leave Haya on the floor of all the rest of the games for the loss of the skin that the former australian line player allowed the first time to return the band to the winning game with the "Minnesso" account of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Haya another opportunity to return the pants, and he also joined him into the game after the tragic Rachel Bush.
Tomsula was a good side and after the game, in the divorce.
Instead of establishing a division of news in the team's presence, he supported them.

"That happens, you just think of the next game and everything," said Hayen.
Hayen compared his debtors in the 2007 Origin game series when the shooting shooting in its shooting area has tried to Quinsland.
Finally, this experience was very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Haine was photod with Australian flags and fanats after the game and posted instagram pictures.

" The secretariat Kerry understood that the support of Russian President Assad is risking to destroy and enhance conflict, and to undertake our common goal to combat extremism, if we do not concentrate on the search for the solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition", says the report published on the United States Department's website.
Carry reaffirmed the commitment to the United States to combat the Islamic State Group (the activity prohibited by the Supreme Court in Russia) in coalition with more than 60 States.
According to the hospital, Asad "only can be a reliable member of the coalition " .
In the phone conversation, Kerry also stressed that the conflict in Syria could only be permitted by means of a political transition from Asad.
In Belarus, the Russian home was threatened for isolation because of the Asaida regime.
The designated Chairman of the White House Joshua Ernesto threatened the exclusion of Russia if it was not stopped supporting Asad.
Ernest, as an alternative, proposed to join an international coalition conducting anti-terrorism operation against the Islamic State.
The recently reports on the presence of Russian military personnel on the Syrian territory.
The head of the Russian Middle Eastern Sergey Lawrence stated that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and helped Syrians to learn the technology to use it against Islamics.
Four of them died when the police opened a shooting of residence guns in Nepal.
Four men, including the four-year-old boy, were killed in the south of Nepal when the police began a firearm in a ball protesting against the proposed new constitution of the country, as the official representative in the mid-middle stated.
The violence occurred in the Tuesday night in Rupanda, about 175 miles west of Katmandu, the capital of the country.
Besna Prasad Dacal, the chief of the surrounding police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered in one of the police offices, some casts and warm bombs.
Mr. Dakar reported that the police were using smoke gas and then shot in the air before they shoot the rain guns.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, said he.
There is no understanding why rain guns that can be killed, but they are traditionally used as less dead alternatives have caused such high mortality.
This was the last few weeks of disastrous protests in the Southern, equivalent part of Nepal, where the representatives of Madezi claim that the new provinces of the new Constitution would reduce their political impact.
Protests also passed in the west of Nepal, among the citizens of the talents who want to have their state.
At least 40 men, including 11 police officers, were killed in cruel clamps, starting from 10
August, when four major political parties signed the country's separation agreement, which became a decisive step towards the new Constitution, but a very coherent issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed over a few centuries.
The new Constitution work has been carried out since 2008, but the lawyers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that has led to thousands of people in April.
The lawyers voted for the draft Constitution in Katmanda this week, and the officials said that the new chapter would be signed at Sunday.
Saink plans to establish a company of 900 jobs.
Sayank is the youngest city in Iraq.
In the 70th century, he has been the center of the chemical industry, with a developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk called a new Mr. Olympic.
On the results of the first year of work, he told new projects and perspectives to the "Obliant".
Olympic, what did you start as a master?
First of all, I learned the results of the checking of financial and financial activities, initiated an independent auditory expertise on the expenditure of the local budget.
The audit of municipalities was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps was the reduction of the documentation by five days.
Previous instance papers could walk for months.
Implementation and the optimalization of expenditure have been developed.
In November last year, a Government ' s travel meeting was held in Saansk, where the issues of the territory were considered.
There was no project documentation in the city for any object.
Without that, Sayank could not participate in federal programmes.
We've started to prepare the CDD on the road, the child garden, the northern changing collectioner and water.
The road work is now being carried out at two parts.
How does the president of the Child garden be fulfiled in the city?
In July this year, 105 children were born in Saansk.
This positive demographic in the city has not been observed over the past 27 years.
So the issue of safeguarding places in children's gardens today is one of the most active ones.
Since 1 September, it was closed to the Capital Disaster Reparatory No. 10, covered at 320 sites.
The estimated value of the repair is 86 million rule.
Those city resources have not yet been received.
Last year after repair, a child garden No. 23 was opened, which is currently visiting 200 children.
The financing was made in terms of regional and local budgets, and the cost of more than 67 million rubbers.
The Administration and the Government ' s support have been searched for furniture and equipment purchasing, helping and the National Initiatives Programme.
There are plans to start building a new child garden in 2016.
We plan to eliminate the nature of children from half to three years of age.
We don't have an apartment for children from three to seven years of age.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the building in the city must, above all, work on the Sayan companies, is that they need to be working.
The 60-home house is already available in October in Lennigrad.
With regard to the construction, I add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Pranagary, which entered into the programme for the residence of the class economy.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The 90-section block will begin in the nearest time.
We have all stated that the building of 100,000 km from the Wildlife was very much to participate in the programme.
One of the conditions - the housing must not be 30 thousands. Rule by one square meter, this cost is the "to the key" office.
If we get the amounts given, we will continue to participate in the programme.
With regard to investors, we have other interesting projects.
At its time on the territory, the Saiian Sweet Sweeperex was built for expenses in 2004.
We are working with the Prosecutor on the Protection of this treaty.
More than the earth under the object is in the federal ownership.
It works with Moscow and is addressed to the transfer of 88 g to the area property with the follow-up of the land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor preparing for reconstruction and launching 1,5 billion rubbers.
With the launch of the sugar, we have 900 workplaces that will be a large part of the city.
The Saansk has developed the Institute of Social Partnership?
We have the order of 140 contracts of socio-economic partnership.
Many projects have been implemented through the active social position of business representatives.
Aware support is shown by firms such as SO: Foreign Centre, New Zeaman TEC, OO, Sayan Brewler, OOD MDF, the leadership of these companies is reacted to all treatments.
On the day of the city, the Saian Broyler gave the city a child city, the Western Centre has performed the reparation of a frozen pool, where specialists were employed with the epatherapy kids, which led to more than 1 million rule.
Thanks to the sponsor means, the territory of the city's SAAC has been well-established.
The sponsors helped the city’s Day beauty.
Like in ancient good times, the participation of urban collections and organizations was a paradise.
The city’s aircraft, the Seyan poetry book, was issued.
The senior and individuals who have a serious contribution to the development of Sayanska are undertaken to the Jewish Mediterranean.
Measures also participate in the urban welfare fund.
The first step was the acquisition of instruments for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 8000,000 rule is aimed at supporting talented children to support children who need a precious treatment and support children from poor-care families.
How are social problems in Saansk?
In the city there are no doctors and physicians.
In order to address the quality question, there is a major importance for housing specialists.
In the past year, we set five apartments for the doctors and four pedagogs received.
We are working on a housing program with the opportunity to stop it for five years.
The plans are the replaning of the building, which will be built by eight other apartments for pedagogy.
The teachers and doctors also participate in the "Gill for Russian Family" program.
In the perspective of building houses for budgetary workers.
The main thing is that there is a working team with which I can solve the most complex issues in the city.
It is important from all crises to make the right conclusions, and life is not stopped.
In Sayanska and our large region.

Google launchs a double-building campaign for the collection of $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the start of a donation campaign intended for the collection of $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping refugee countries flying from disappeared war and dinner countries.
Google used an unharmed personal approach by an anonymous campaign of collecting donations in his blog.
Instead of make a statement, Google Rita Mahof, who was flying with the family of Kabul when she was seven years old, described his personal experience.
"We've come to some doubtful trains and buses, to suffer hunger, desire, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many of them, such as my family, are desperately needed for help.
The donations will be transferred to the four non-commercial organizations employed by refugees and migrants: “Doctors without border”, the International Save Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that it would take the first $5,5 million of donations until the amount of the google.com/refugeerelief would not be reached by $11 million.
Europe is opposed to a stronger crisis with refugees during the Second World War, which has risen in most of the four-year-old civil war in Syria, which has been transferred to more than four million people in this year.
Many of them are also flying from the covered wars of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetes with small fertility may help the illness surgery
A pleasant effect after the surgery of grain in persons with small oil that suffers diabetes of 2 type may take at least five years, according to the new study.
However, until now, it is early to say that diabetes with small oxygen are more than those who receive non-chirurgic treatment.
"The mortality statistics are not exactly soon", said Dr. Robin Bleckstone, a expert on the surgery surgery surgery's new study in the column of JAMA Surgery.
The fertile surgery, or barrier surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the heavy.
They reduce hunger feeling and limit the capacity of organisms to feed.
In a few years, the barritory surgery proved its effectiveness for the treatment of diabetes two, but the main studies were conducted among people with morbide oil index of the body mass (MT) 35 or above.
IMIT, the weight of growth is considered normal, from 18.5 to 24.9.
IMIT 25 or above says that human weight is lost, and people with ICT above 30 are considered to be gender.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study of Tayban hospital researchers, Min-Sheng General used the data collected since 2007 for comparing two barritory surgery types, the smuggling of swallowing and handing gastronomy, with the medication of 2 types of diabetes with small sweats.
The average value of ICTs for the surgical involvement was from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, ICT those who have received non-chirurgical treatment from diabetes remains at the level 29.
Between the transaction moved completely from the diabetes 36 per cent, and partly 28 per cent.
The medication group, for comparison, was only 1 per cent out of diabetes, and only about 2 per cent.
Furthermore, blood pressure indicators, triglicerids and " bad " LPNP " were generally better in the surgical group,” states the authors.
Studiers also controlled the blood level of A1s, reflecting the blood sugar levels in the dinamic.
Hemoglobin A1c better keep up below 7 percent, writes researchers.
After the surgical involvement, hemoglobin A1c was reduced from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
However, he remained stable, about 8 per cent in the therapeutic group.
However, the best indicators of the gluchemic control reflected by the hypoglobine A1c did not reduce mortality levels for five years, according to Dr. Chi-Heng Su and colleagues.
The research group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared to the hand-good group, the swallowing group had lost more weight (18.7 km against 14.2 kg), increased IMD (0.4 to 5.1) and A1s (3.1 per cent to 2.1 per cent) and was closer to the full remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent against 16.7 per cent).
While a new study does not demonstrate the advantages of the surgical method in the part of life after five years, there are confirmations on the results of the investigation of people with the lost body in Sweden that the surgical treatment really leads to a increase in life-sufficiency, as reported by Bleckstone from the Medicine Cole in Finix, the University of Arizona.
According to the Swedish study for persons who elected barritory interference, the possibility of death for 15 years was approximately 29 per cent below compared to a group in which more traditional methods were applied.
In spite of the new study, Blaxton noted that it supported people with ICT below 35 interested in this procedure.
" The report is very important, since it claims that such surgical involvement is safe in the group with low ICT, where there is no increased risk of mortality or sexual disease, " she stated.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to be seriously treated as a patient is in the diameter between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to let people do this seriously," she said.
I think that when they get genetic changes that start in their body of fertilization and diabetes, it is very difficult to make it back.
In the Mitians, there were 9 million rubbers from the house of the snake.
In the Mitians, slaughterers were attacked in the homes and stolen 9 million rubbers and three women's shoes.
This provides an interfax with the IMD Press Service.
The Inspector came on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown ones through the open entrance gate went to the house situated on the Garden Street, connected the 20-year-old son of the house and, threatening both feet, slaughtered 9 million rubbers and three shoes.
Provisional data, the amount of the damage was $9,265,000, as a criminal case under article “Razboy”.
Fanates from Europe are risking to become homeless.
Only 23 Peterbourg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists who will come in 2018 to see the Championship of the World on Flotball.
The final guests are not intended to obtain the permission.
The experts believe that it's a very alarming sign.
In the prevention of the world ' s primary, the authorities must urgently consider how to divid all guests of the city.
The Rosbalt Countries believe that the cost of the coated apartment is 10 to 30 per cent, and that and after the chain of the coal, they must be paid.
The Championship of the Peace on Flatball has emphasized the state of Russian guests.
According to the law written under the first convenence, each hotel Petersburg should take the classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the number of stars and the levels of the service.
It is now understood that this is not all possible: the hotels are so scared of checking that they often have not sent documents to the requests of the Federal Anti-monopolis Service for Petersburg.
As Head of the UFAS Vadim Wormlers reported, the State has studied 138 hotels and now plans to establish 34 cases in respect of a guest, many who just did not respond to anti-mono-users.
There are signs that the leadership of the three decades of companies has been inflicted by a place of one or a different number of stars in the advertising, stated the Worshiplers.
The problem is that, now on account of each number, no one can be lost before 2018.
The officials suspect that during the football champion, the peterbourg hotels will take all the peterburger hotels.
Now, in the city, the tourists can be 30.5.000 numbers.
According to Smolln, in Petersburg, 17 five-year-old hotels, 51 four-star guests, 100-2-thirds, 550 one-stars.
According to the first Vice-Premier Committee on Tourism, only 23 guests had been classified at this time - so much checks were accredited in the company in Petersburg.
And whether some of the hotels had ordered such a procedure in regional enterprises, the Smoll of the Surprising Status was unknown.
The last classification may also be more, but no one knows about it.
"The last half of the hotels were not very strict to classify", acknowledged the Director of the Northwest Office of the Russian Tourism Office of Ecatherine Shadaki.
This is explained in the high season, during which hotels pay more money and do not want to do other matters.
Another reason is that the budgets that have not been undertaken for checking expenditures may, according to the status of 30 to 100 000 rules, depending on the status of the guest.
However, recently, the guest leaders have been intensified and began to make requests for classification, assured the Shadawn.
The hotels must be repaid until 1 July 2016, not only paying the money, but they do not have the right to work on the world championship.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed payment in the hotel will be developed at the time of the tourist.
The forms for which the value will be calculated are set up in the next year.
This has been done to avoid a 200-300 per cent of prices, for example during the Peterburg Economic Forum.
We need to have conscience and not allow up to two-third times, but the hotels have to pay.
"I think that growth will be up to 50 percent," explained President of the Russian Hospital Association of Gennadei Lamshine.
In its sense, Vadim Warms did not be sure that the fixing of the price corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much this is in the economic theory framework, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better inconsistent travel," he said.
It's not clear that it's going to be with popular decorations.
The Members of the Hospital have introduced a draft law which has to be prohibited in homes.
We hope that this law will not be adopted or not regarded by Petersburg.
“We will leave the point of view that the hostels must be saved,” believe Nana Havachiya.
However, in its words, the mini-actor owners must, in any case, be ready to restore the Life Code.
If the Hospital is still endorsing the draft law, Peterburg is closed to about 80 per cent of the hostels, and at this time 1.5 thousand numbers.
According to the President of the Re restaurants Federation and the hotels of North Zealand Leonida Harvar, in Peterburg there are no two-third hotels, which are once and inhabited by football bottles, as well as the four-five-shirt side of the hotel.
This situation is similar when "in the 80-month stage, 750,000 wheels are sit."
This can be corrected as once by mini-actors.
The expert's possible prohibition is "ideotic": "It seems strange that one person can live in the apartments, and that's why there is no reason."
If the guest is used as a common habit, I agree that it's wrong.
But if a guest in which the guests come to a short time, why not?
The mini-hospitals are risking to lose the world's football champion and because of their non-relativeness.
The whole hundreds of small hotels are simply not able to classify themselves.
All guests of the city will be assigned to work at summer 2016.
"Companies that may not take this procedure so much, therefore they will reject less paid orders from mini hotels, but choose those traveling," noted Gennadei Lamshin, added that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of the check at this time are significantly higher than the Peterbourgs.
The result of the Peterburgian delay, including the permanent stops in the Government ' s tourism block, does not contribute to the balanced work.
Experts believe that, if the Peterburger hotels are not enough, they may have to be focused on the district guests and the dining house.
For example, Petersburg’s 300-year-old celebration may mobilize a fleet, that is, the tourist guests will be able to live in castles.
Furthermore, many malicious people will be prepared towards the slaughter, where they will be able to be at night.
"It's not to make so many guests so they're wearing out." - He's sure Gennadei Lamshin.
The large population will also be used during the football primary.
The most likely all in the city will build coffee reserves.
Rail lines will grow up to 10 to 30 percent.
"The first place is going near the stadium," said a specialist on the Agency for Development and Research in Laris Bragin.
The price of the rail may not be returned to the previous level after the champion, especially in bed areas.
This will contribute to the construction of new transport links in the area of the city, emphasized.
It should not be forgotten by human qualities.
For example, Leonard Harvard is confident that Peterburg was always a hospital city in which people are not simply aware of the way but may still be a mini-exploration.
There's also complications.
My father, in the 1970s, met a family from Murmanska, a father, the mother and two children.
There were some nights where the guests were hard to sleep on the board.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment," she remembered the cousin.
Indeed, it added that this is not yet the case in the populations of the city - to tell them at home that there were consequences and fears.
But may the errors of hotels and Governments should have been remembered in 2018 after the unsuccessful decisions of the Council?
The Julian's "Send" of the Amorian area.
Today, with enthusiasm, he looked at the clause of the Jürinus in Gosmid.
He did such things when our generation was still learned to trade newspapers, and he was still in a beautiful form.
The topic, like, "the LDR protest against the outcome of the Amirian elections".
Protocols are not triggered - because there is nothing; other protocols, except signed by the elections, are in the LDR, judged in all.
He is the second place of Ivan Abram, and he cries something like: "This is the winner of elections."
And there's nothing to do with Rodney, and then, after the chair, the fraction of the meetings, "You're all with the fronts of your shoes and sweet."
The press, of course, is not Abraamova, but the skandal and demarch of the fraction as a result of the scandal and distress.
In reality, Volfoovic was beautiful and elegantly shocked in the Amuria area together with the Abraham.
For the whole country, this is a normal shift of the Jürinus style, and it is not mostly protesting the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the fraction was formally scanned, and the elections, if you believe the party website and the Facebuck Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leaders of the subject evidently cry.
He provides the dead in Amore to guard his dead, and he pronounces it against the One Russians in general and nothing of a Rodney's fault.
A great decision to not lose the face, and in the real, and not the shown scandal is not going.
Another thing is now that Abram itself is in a strange situation.
On the other hand, he did not expect anything, but no alternative protocols on the hand.
He is not in public attention, on the one hand, and on the other hand, he became formal and to distract the respected champion, and, in other words, the Champagners in the ER and the UNFF address.
And he must, of course, really think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, policy number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 to the only area of one-handled area, it can be converted into a couple that has been successfully used by its own Party Guide and Super-Organist for the ONG itself and for the Party Leader.
That's exactly that, it wouldn't be Jürin, he would have been able to think and to observe him almost.
It's still growing and growing to him.
The news showed that the LDR will return to the same plenary during the next plenary.
That's what the bath is going on.
On the one hand, Abram’s theme is polluted.
It's really red.
"It's impossible to all come to Europe."
Europe cannot take all refugees, stated that the real decision of the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetian Buddhists called to stop violence in refugee countries.
The continued crisis of refugee crisis was addressed to the opening of the Centre of Commons in Oxford, conducted by the Ethic Studies, at the beginning of its 10-day visit in Britain.
He stated that in existing circumstances humanity interests should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this results in relief, the reaction of Western European countries to the crisis of refugees is not adequate.
"It's impossible to all come to Europe," he said.
Although Dalai Lama highlighted the efforts undertaken by Germany and Austria in relation to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a timely decision.
"The concern of thousands of refugees is beautiful, but at the same time you should think about long-term decisions how to bring this peace and current development, mainly through education, in these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We need to deficit the use of force.
The application of the force has never solved these problems," he added.
On violence, Dalaylama also commented on the action of George Bush after the terrorist acts 9/11, said that the US cruel reaction had laid down an uncontrolled event.
After 9/11, I expressed my confusion in the letter to President Bush and said that the problem could be addressed by non-weapon.
I know that his purpose was good, but he used the strength, and it caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Fourth decline growth in the last 4 years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported about almost 400 per cent increase, since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age that have been declined with high sperm maintenance, as reports the Toxicology Centre of Georgia.
According to Dr. Galorda Lopes, director of the Toxicological Centre of Georgia, the case of proclamation of children to 12 years of illness for the decline of hands reported in the toxicological centre increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"The children are contacting these substances more and, unfortunately, some percent of them are sent to the Speed Help Division", said Lopes CNN.
He told some children that drinking a special deficit, and some do this to make an impression on their friends or opposite social networks.
Youtube videos show that adolescents drink desinfictively as a deteriorate drink.
The report reports that adolescents were shocked by deficiency with stir-containing liquidity for the swallowing of the rat to get a stronger drink.
Childs of age may touch the pleasant smokes of desinfying ice.
"The baby doesn't think it could hurt him," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractives (disfixing skins for hands) are aromatised.
There are deficiencious leverages for hands with clobs, wine and apple, which are very attractive for children.
The deficiency of the hand contains 45 to 95 per cent of the spurt.
In small children, in particular, only a number of disorders can cause alcohol equality.
“ This is a high-center spray,” reported Fox 4 in Cansas City, Dr. Steven Thornton, the principal doctor of the Toxicology Center in Canasas University Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave this whiskey with a visa, but people have the meaning of these deficiencious means for your hand, and if children get to them, it's a fast way to use a large number of alcohols.
Rassel, a six-year-old girl who recently promoted a deficit instrument for the hand with a clonic aroma in a number of approximately four dishes was sent to the Headquarters.
The level of alcohol in it was 179, in two times more than the adult, which is considered in the state of alcoholic abuse, according to Dr. Chris Ritchy, a doctor of rapid assistance that had been treated in the Gwinnett medical centre, not far from Atlanta.
He traveled to his words and couldn’t walk when she was given to the office of rapid assistance.
The doctors watched her all night in a single child clinic, not to miss any signs of brain trauma, because the girl fell down and shooted the head, said Ritchy.
"It was very scared," said the CNN Organia Scott, mother of Nazi.
This could be dead for my child.
Lopes recommended that parents and teachers use non-pilot substances or dismissing salphates, in addition to strike to remove desinfictive skins for children’s reaching zone.
In addition to alcoholic deformation, some deficienciated leaks are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after the declining of the instrument containing a toxicly not identified ingredient.
Health officers suspect that the product contains metal is a dead agent, not a physician spill that was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three four-quarter students in the north of New York were condemned to compare their "contrast" teacher through the "distribution of antibactrial substances in the class", according to the police report.
The teacher was a strong allergic for desinflators to hand, and she prohibited to keep them in its class.
The police believes that the unsuccessful plan was the " post-spread" and addresses the issues of educational discipline.
As the oldest child library in Barnabas, it became a family club.
At the end of the castle, the N.N.K. is a magnificent sweet sweat in their shoeting library.
Young people who are looking for books are trying to smile her confects.
Some generations have been in the library for 95 years.
The first readers in the past twenty - seventh centuries have been cut here with the shooting pieces, spectacles in Mayako, literature vectors and recorded with the wife of Lenin.
The record continued four years, and, as wrote in 1939, the New York Times newspaper, with every day "Family between the Hope of the Constantine of the Constantins and friends of the City of Barnaula" became more strong.
The hope of Constantine has even sent the far away from the barnaul friends to his child's photo.
And when the barnaulers asked, whether the Hope of Constantine would not be influenced by the library, he wrote that no, he was not inflicted.
The letters have been covered in the museum for a long time, and the first readers have to explain whose profile strikes the barrier in the library building.
In the years of reconstruction, different people were calling, and why is the child’s library not renamed?
Please be a library of a good child writer, without political shock!
The village library officers thought and decided to leave everything.
It's the most famous and loved library in Barnabas as "Leinkie" in Moscow.
On the ground in the library, a trail from a helmet strip.

Oila was a legal manager, was eighth working, in five, and all other managers were different from love for qualification.
And then there was an advertisement in the Internet: "The illustrator is needed for a book."
The book wrote a small American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "Mother cancer in my mother."
He made illustrations and thought that life could end at any time, and there will be no miracles in it if you don’t create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates the children's books of the world, and its own statements.
Traditionally, children lose interest in the book that they are still living in some virtual space...
But there are children readers, and their parents understand the importance of reading, says the Russian Planet Director of the Tatiana Kushvid Library.
In the past few years, we have even been assured that the child's library needs, and she's going to live - some kids are going here!
I think it's interesting to read again.
The library is a large exhibition with updated photo exhibition.
Once the quarter shows new photos of readers in the entire family library: mother, father and children.
The library is pleased that the pope has always come with children.
In two years, when a child reads all the Cookies, he needs a more complex book.
But now the law under which the eight-year-old vulners are prohibited to issue books from category 12+.
In order to get such a book, the child must bring parents to herself - they come back and then return, and the "Cruz" slowly becomes something like a family club.
In the library, a revolutional collectioner was smiling and herms, conducting the King in the annex to the New York magazine in 1936.
Because we are now not just a conceptual book-making space, we are now open to move, we are trying to become a special place: not a house, not a job, not a school, Tatiana Kushvid explains.
We can come here to read, play, shoot all together.
We made a game area for a little kid comes just to play, and the hands still go into a book!
Some of our parents are shocked, and they are shooted with their feet, and they don’t want to leave.
Often, Mom comes with shoes - and we are glad that the library is the first place among all other places where we have to come with the little girls.
The mother of Kushvid says: The modern children like the classic child literature as we have ever said:
"The creative matter is now developed, and a lot of attention is given to the authors who are a linking agreement between generations."
And if you talk about small children, they're important to be a hero that travels from one book to another.
The children don't like to get up with their heroes.
The library continues to issue books for parents who tell that there is a child ' s modern literature, which books should take attention and why.
The bottles are so encouraging and encouraging that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
The issue of books on the front of the read room for adults is prohibited.
This magnificent prize only has children.
...In the latest library room, there is a square box with an old wooden board in the box.
The girls will shut up under your steps -- it's a very old time machine.
With your childhood book, you're seeing like old friends: Hello, well, we're not changed with you.
Ellie is still pleasantly walking on the way shooted by the wild skippich, the ring of Tolla Rijko's smile, and Malchish-Kibalchish did not say that he had a strong word.
The books are like the passwords, they can know their own in any place.
There are roots in the storage and the actual books - for example, the revolutionary collectioner had been with the souls and hermes.
Or to conduct the King in a famous annex to the New York magazine.
Or the "Morsilky" in 1936.
The time was stolen, the page was broken in the tea.
These publications are no longer published to readers.
That's our future collection, and I'm all dreaming -- I'm going to pension and I'll take a rare child book.
But the kids aren't going to say, and the beautifuls in old books aren't very light, and the theme... you're opening the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now, why did we all write this Pioneer Truth?
But it was still interesting, - it says the Russian Planet, Galina Elisa, who launched a book guarding.
Morsilica's pages were shocked from time.
Galina's life is keeping a book.
She knows the color of Buratino, in the year in which Harry Potter was the head of the Griffindor Championship on the board, where Carlson uses a motorist, and who works by the father of Alice Severine.
The library work is little paying, and everyone who can live without these books is very quickly finding another professional.
There are only the most convinced ones: teachers, pedagogues, workers of the book culture.
They can also know that it's a professional parent of the child's library.
If he rid you in the first minute, it's a professional.
I really love children's books: as the library I like to be that they're precise and beautifully standing on the fields, and I like to read them, says Galina Vietnam.
I'm reading everything: military, historical behavior, statements, fantastics.
Reading modern Russian authors, swimming translations...
Of course, I think there was everything else in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and encouraging of everything that happened with me then.
And as I was sweet to love them, I thought the library was a magic place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sit and read.
I hope the book will always be, despite the riders.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring children, and the grandma...
Shelter of hearing: There are no differences in Sertica.
Graphits checked discussions on the differences in Sertica after the recognition of Dale that "Hupps" is in a bad situation, but it will correct it.
Harts will protest against the complaint of the Skotland Fitbon Association to Nelson, and Warberton is threatening the signing of contracts in January, which might be violated by the team.
"Dons" increased the advantage before "Select" to 5 points
Adam Runey's pants in the first secret gave the Averdin small advantage of Hamilton in Pittdore, which allowed Dons to rescue from "Selectics" at five points.
Graphits for the verification of discussions on disputes
This has been hearing about the differences in the Sertica, which were sent by Griffits, claiming that he and his team partners were not suffering from any enhanced critical, preparing for meeting with the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think that the games are trying to do with him.
The Netherlands's fault because the Skotlandians are not in the fight against the title - de Bur
The former Reyngers and the former member of the United States, Ronald de Burr, said that the Dutch football farmers had lost interest in Sertica because he was not coherent with the Rangers.
Where Bour, currently the representative of Acksa, said, "The most appreciative moments in the Dutch are no longer shown in the "Seltica" game and why?"
That's because it's not the Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Reangers' return.
They're talking about the Star Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interesting.
The Star Company plays a lot of pressures, and not only people in Skotlandia want to see these games.
"I'm all changed," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale acknowledged that "Settic" was difficult, but the Norwegian trainer shouted everything to change.
According to "Malma" and, as a result, the Champion League immediately took the game of 10 footballists Aberndine, which now, at five points, operates the top table building.
However, Dale said, "The Selitha was bad periods and before, and we will go again."
Now we want to get out of this as fast as possible.
I understand that it's very worthy, and many people are very bad, very bad or disappointed of what happens.
And we too, but we need to continue.
And indeed, we really need to support the Sertica because the games are much better.
Stay together now so important.
Warberton is incredibly waiting for January
Despite the view that the whole few weeks ago, those who suggested that he determined some of the purposes of the January Transfers, the boss of the Realgers Mark Warberton is infidelity with regard to the Jewish campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the team.
The former Brentford attacker said, "The Yenvar transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As regards the players that come to the summer, you have a period before the beginning of the season for their adaptation, which you have seen in our own group in this season.
The team works very well.
Sometimes there is more damage to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
The question "Settic" called the finishment of the carriage
The shock of Soonsy, linked to "Settick" during the transfer window, pointed out that he could leave a football after the contract was completed with the "Lieveds".
29-year-old player suffered from shipping problems for two years, and he couldn't leave Wells this summer.
Harts will oppose the SFA claims of Neilson.
Harts took account of 2:1 when Patterson was removed, and began playing 3:2, but the red protector card was later cancelled; this is the third red card of Columbus, which was cancelled for eight months.
Nathan did not reject his words, saying, "I didn't make any doubt of the ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffits promised to avoid Tynkash.
Hybernian's direct player received a conversation after acknowledging that the song was sweet words about the former Harts game Rudy Skycell.
The university occurred in the Rooseburn area in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Deb in Tainkasle in March 2014.
"It was the shock, and it was shocked," said the attacker, adding, "I'm sure I wouldn't go back to Tainkash if he doesn't play for "Slect".
Donnelly: The Tannadis Council is confident in the "Dandy Yuntead" mine
Simon Donnelly states that the Board of Directors of Danny Washington is still sure that the manager's team will change the situation to the best, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation in the field should be done.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the people to go again," said Donnelly.
MacInnes is glad you won Hamilton.
Dereck Macinez acknowledged that his "Abertin" team had to fight against Hamilton Assis to achieve the seventh winning in the first liga, put them up to five above the "Seltica", above the tourist table, through Adam Runey's panels in the first time.
MacInes said, "No team that would have winned anything is a cup or a liga liga that did not win the meetings like this."
The level of unemployment among Skotlands is not changed, while the United Kingdom is in general growing
BEZRABITY in Skotland remained a level of 164,000 people from May to July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom was totally increased to 10,000 to 1,82 million in the same period.
The unemployed level in Scotia, 5,9 per cent, was over the United Kingdom level at 5,5 per cent, as shown by National Statistics Service (UNS).

The Ministry of Scotland, David Mandel, has commented on the most recent numbers, said: "The Government's long-term plan has set the basis for strengthening the economy."
It has been almost a serious year since the Scotia has taken a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen the further improvement in the situation in Scotia on the market in the growth of employment and the reduction of unemployed people.
Why I Is A Witness in Oclahom
Today, adorning from legal involvement at the late stage, I'll see how people say.
If this happens, and I hope not yet, I'll sit on the sight gate of the mortal camera in the Oklajoma State when Richard Glossip will be shocked with a death infection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
The first request was made in January, through his close friend, and even though I was back to shock, I agreed.
With the nearness of this day, I became afraid.
So why do you do that?
I agreed, as I thought it was a good way to tell the detailed history of death penalty.
This would propose a unique racist.
Yes, journalists are authorized to attend punishments in America, and because those who desire more often than the place, the results of the lady lottery decide who will be elected.
The number of press locations were decreased from 12 to five.
Whoeverever has been chosen, he will look at it without emotions.
I can't do that.
I'll sit with the closest friends of Richard Glossip, and we've got our relationship with him after a few months of phone calls and one visit over two and half hours.
I like this guy.
We're often laughing when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not allowed to take blocks and hands to write what I see.
I have to try to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklajoma accused me in Twitter that I do my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes to get access.
I was grateful to her.
She acknowledged that it could "we could" but she still believed that I was wrong with what I do.
Richard Glossip did not agree with what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me that to write, and I wouldn't do this even if he said.
I told him that he could get me out of his list of Witnesses at any time.
But he wants the journalist of the international publication to write it there.
If he dies, he believes that it helps the movement of the death punishment.
Kim Belver, the reporter of Haffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this, listen to the subscriptions I wrote.
I'm not going to get here in detail again.
I can't say with sure that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
His acts after the murder, Barry Van Trezee, are guilty of crime.
But I believe there's a great probability that he's not guilty for murder.
I am strongly sure that the authority for the death condemnation was not sufficient.
I think his punishment is wrong.
And from this cancer I'll see how he's going to die.
I can't say that I'm the entire objection.
It will be other reporters to which you can call for it.
From me you know how this is to look like a man who loves me dies without the need.
The prosecution of the human police was dealt with out of the Canning River
The Constante of Canning-Well was able to talk to a man out of the Canning River, and he himself remains sweet.
The people of Perta intended to go from the police, but they didn't shoot, shoot into a smooth water in a few meters from the police officer who tried to "speak to talk to him to the beach".
The Canning-Well police was sent on Tuesday on the unlawful prosecution in the Foreign Territory in Baqingum.
When the police were noticed the suspected, he tried to get out of them and leave to Canning.
But he wasn't too far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, let's miss me," said the senior sergeant Chandel Castle.
The Laclan Perhavez constitute was not very desirable, so he used a more safeer receipt - " negotiations with a good police."
"Atimes people do weird things to try to escape," says the senior sergeant Kassidyn.
Footballist-chumpion Ben Cassince just remembered it.
In 2006, Cassince went to the cube to avoid meetings with the police patrol to check alcohol and tried to move Soon.
His efforts were shocked, but the local people were understood to discover the shooting "Ben Cassince Biatlon".
Peter Mudy accused the sports in trying to spy and threaten to get out of the end of the sport
Peter Mudi accused Racing Victoria to spend in his last year's shooting and threatened that the final sport would continue immediately.
His museum became shore and staff of the Racing Victoria Technology Division, which he accused that they organized a personal campaign against him, and removed from the old Lady Tatai, because of the violation of the rules of use of drugs in the old day, in the midst, became the last smooth.
Museo reported Fairfax Media that he always illustrated all the efforts that participated in the castle, and he was in a difficult situation when he was talking about the positive outcome of the Leders to what he could not explain.
He maintained the language of suspicion in the spy for half a year and did not want to "seen as green wine".
"I wouldn't speak anything about it, and I suffered a long time, but sometimes you're so exciting from the colea that you're not going to stop," Musdi said.
They know that it's continued.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep strongly.
I want to walk with a high-level head and I want my owners to know -- I do everything to them.
When they'll start thinking that's not so, then I'll have to stop being a trainer.
Then I have to think what to do with my license.
The Museo had previously declared a sense during the interview at the racing.com that the Technology Division had tried to spy in his chariot.
"Every year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart sit in a room with a man I'm calling if they ask him, and they invited him to work in my chair to give information about what I'm doing in the chariot," said Mudy at Racing.com.
They're apparently thinking that I'm a fool.
If so, all of them should, of course, make a statement because the attempt to get me out of them has not been able to.
Robert Rollton, former RVL Chairman, David Mudy, current Chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, Executive Director of RVL, knows all this time and now knows.
Should this make me think that the case becomes personal?
Should it not be courageous in the RVL and respond to what is happening in this business, other people other than trainers?
Do I Become For This Factory?
Is that what I'm wrong for this professional?
Maybe people think it's like that.
Maybe they have to take my license and put me out, and I don't doubt what I'm saying now, I can let them think about it.
But I came up to the point where I'm going to be, and that's what I'm hurting.
I'm sorry of this.
I will give pressure to them and be responsible for their decision-making.
I have a family support, and I can go.
The trainer was only growing during the long investigation of the case with the cobalt and the leaders, and the last removed horses from the age urged him to claim that he could "exclude his license on the table".
Museums, most well known as the unbelievable Champion of Blake Kaviar, called for the use of medical preparations on the day of the "measurable" resignation after the legs of the horses were made compressed from the grain, which is a violation of the rule.
That's a violation of the rule on the boxes.
"I must take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my wrong workers made her complaint on his feet.
She could get a complaint last night.
She could get him yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the flight.
Museums may be dismissed for three months in accordance with the rules on the application of medical preparations on the day of decrease for the use of the composite, which opened the investigation.
It's an anecdote.
Those who establish these rules do not know anything about horses.
"We all know that we need a rule, but that's too far," said Mudy.
Training driver and switching from the location in Kyriam, arrested
The police was arrested by a person who had been arrested in the weekly motocyclist in Kyriam and hidden from the place of the event.
The motociclist was put on a helicopter in the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious wounds after the slaughter of the car on Murray Welle Hawaii on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver went away, not stopped to help a fervent motorcycle.
On Monday, the 50-year-old residence of the city of Natal was the police in Sheparton.
It is expected that it would be pronounced to leave a place of occurrence, non-assisting and in violation of other rules of road movement.
Motocyclist, 40-year-old resident of Kyama, remains in a stable hospital.
Melbourne Storm Trainer, Craig Bellma, plays the accused of conspirators in the use of cruel force admissions
Merburg Storm trainer, Craig Bellma, called the shooting criticism of his shooting team as a "sliding of the agenda" from the two NRL chariot favorites.
The Sidney Rusters Trent Robinson said that the judges were allowed to fight Storm on Friday nights at the end of a qualified game in Sidma.
Brian Bronkos trainer Wayne Bennet made an outstanding shoot on Storm after his team wins a qualified tourist financed in Northern Quinnishand Kabowyz at Saturday night when he called this "typical" game for the driving line and said that two of the Queensland teams weren't "shaped" in the leadership.
Bells protected the shooting of their team and claimed that they were just focused on the "contact" by shooting the skin.
Bellham added that he had the confidence of his team ' s criticism from two leading trainers, since this means that they were concerned about the possible slaughter of the " St. " .
"I didn't hear that Trent Robinson talked about sweetheless receipts when they played us with account 242," he said in the midst.
I can command that we have not changed anything all year in our systems or technologies of protection, just in the past six weeks we have given special attention to contacts with the smell, and that was a turning moment for us.
There's three years, and he's evidently training a good team, so he's probably not a chance to play, and it's got some shock for him.
It's amazing how it is always shown in this year.
Bellham talked to Bennett's idea about the impressive football, recalled his teacher that "Son Jorge Dregons" had winned Bennett in the champion in 2010, showing a sweet football.
Wayne's talking about the hidden football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our Tuesday night, and see how impressive their game was," noted Belize.
I remember that in 2010, Saint-Jorge was a little criticized by calling a laugh team, and Wayne said that it wasn't worried about it.
But now he has a team that can show what he is looking for as an impressive football, especially his young half-defenders with their speed.
It's a football that you'd like to play when you have such games.
He made this observation in 2010, and now he wants to all play in the football in his style - not in each team, there are two defenders such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play such a game.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things, because some of them are worried about games with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they arrived to large games.
Bellham also noted that the "Storm" and "Rosters" game was consistent with a large number of looks than Bronscopes and Caboios.
The Broncks game probably was good, I didn't see her, but what was the account? 16-12?
He was at our game 20:18, had two other attempts - and what is that the impressioning football?
Or consider impressive interruptions and unexpected attempts?
It's a rutin for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some stage we can meet them there.
The "Storm" at the end of this week, as they wined the right to take the North Queensland Kabujos, or "Cronalla Sharx" on Saturday on Saturday night at the AAMI Park station, tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Prosecuted for the conservation of drugs serbs launched by $2000,000
A man who is threatening the life prison for the attempt to spend 40 kilos of cocaine in Quinsand Contract was launched by $2000,000.
Marco Maximich, 29 years old, is one of the five arrested ones last month after the federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay ice from South America through the Vanuatu and slaughtered in Kumer in August.
Over the morning, Maximuit and his messagers were watched at the stage, and later he met them in Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 km of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximich threatens the deadline for the purchase of drugs in the number of enough to sell, the lawyer Maximich claims that the evidence that the last person has tried to prevent the whole party is missing, and that a man could be in the coffee without any meaning.
The Supreme Court of Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximecvith had to leave the ship.
The last report has been linked to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the court in the midst.
During the crime, he lied to the police about the place of his arrival.
The mothers and fathers of Maximich were proposed to put a joint lounge to $200,000 for his release.
"The two statements are apparently that the amount of $20,000 is too large for them," noted the judge Flanagan.
But one of the measures is inadequate as a guarantee that it would not disappear, added the judge.
Maximec has been allowed to be released under the shuttle, provided that it would be held as an Australian and Serbian passport every day to be observed in the police and to observe the comandant hour from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Phoenix Cacicaris: "I'm going to strive to the last seconds of Greece."
The main trainer of the Greece Fox Cacicaris gave his team after the 1/4 shop of Evobolaket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
He said, the judge of the game has decided individual errors.
It was a big game, quoted by AFP Kacicaris.
We were ready to play a good game in the performance of the Spanishs.
They were forced to work in the defence, but defence errors were determined by a meeting court.
It's painful, but I'm proud of my boys.
They've been fighting to the last seconds.
Joel Friend: "I'll be placed on the CSC."
The CIA Joel Friend said that he wouldn't believe in the wicked army.
The British man also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break the negative trend and finally win Eurolygu in the next season.
I talked to the trainer Dimtris Studis several times this year and, just after I joined the team, quotes "R-Sport" Fredland.
Yeah, I need some time to rebuild to the central position, even though in the NBA I played more forwards.
But now it's going to be more to resist to the big central counterparty, but I've already done it, so I think, and now I'm doing it.
The army wins the last time in 2008.
Since then, they had six times to Final four, but they couldn't show their best basket.
It's the opinion that somebody's shocked the team.
All this game, you can't run forever.
Of course, it's complicated. I understand all the disappointment of the club and his ballers.
But we have a good team now, and if we're showing the best thing we can, we've got a good chance to win Euro, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the mocks have run to the tourist, and I think this year will be the CSCC year.
With regard to the slaughter, I am not a sovereign man and I don't believe in any wickedness.
I believe in hard work and decision-making, if you're connecting these two things, it's all possible.
I don't have any certain rituals before playing, I just listen to music and try to relax the way it is possible.
Louis Enrique: "I'll be special to Roma with me."
The main trainer "Barselon" Louis Enrique did not hide that it returned to Rome to the 1nd tour of the Champion Tower of Champion with Rom with special feelings.

I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I got a certain experience.
With Rome, I have an exclusively warm memories.
This will be a special game for me, but that's not so important.
The main is to try champions from winning in Lega.
The august meeting at the Cuban Joan Hamper does not affect the team's action in the nearest match.
I'm waiting for the Rom of the game she showed in the A series against the United States.
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Wadim Scriptchenko: "Crasnodar" has various options of attacking action.
The responsibilities of the main “Urala” train in the predicting of the 9th squeeze of the first slope with the "Ronnodar" noted the diversity of the attacking team schemes.

The unit will be 21 September and begin at 16.30 at Moscow time.
How we'll play with "Rosnodar", we're still looking at, it's bringing the official "Urala" website.
We've got a whole week of training.
This team has different action options, and many times its attacks, and we are not less late, so I think that it will be very interesting.
In prevention of this game, considering that the "Krasondar" of Europe's shock of Liga against the Tormund Bourruss, we're trying to be very well prepared to win.
Rocher Kanez: "Astana House" can select the shoes with whom you want."
The Astana Protector Roher Cannez after the 1st tour of the group tour of Championians with Benfia (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team game in the future.
The Astana's view is that there is a ability to select the shoes in any counterparty.
Despite the matching has been hard to us, I can say that we have played well, it brings the official WEFA's words of Canas.
"Banfick" above the class, but in the home match, I think we can figure out on their eyes.
It's real.
But first we need to think about the Galatazara and then about Atleticco.
In home shops, we can shoot out anywhere.
Rafael Bentes: "Where you want, Christine Ronald is the best in the world."
The main train Rafael Bentes expressed the satisfaction of the great winning in the 1st tour of the Championian group turin Liga with Shatter (4:0).
A specialist gave a position for the Christtian Ronald forum, who became the author of the three heads.
Matt wasn't easy because "Shatter" was able to have a shirt, it brings the official WEFA words of Bentis.
There were no moments of the counterparty, but their constraints are always in danger.
I don't say that the Real played perfectly, but we had blunt opportunities.
I'm glad that we didn't lose the legs and killed four.
Cristinana Ronald confirmed its level.
It's the best game in the world, I repeat it as many times.
"Christ Ronald can't compare the Messie."
The Barcellona Protector, Jordan Alba, believes that nobody can compare with his colleague Lionel Messy.
According to the Spanish Forward, Christtian Ronald can't do this.
Messi at five heads above the other, "Le Figaro Albu" quotes what Leo can do, no one can.
Even Cristinana Ronald.
Leo's all changed, I can't compare him with anyone.

Barcelone is a special counterpart, a good team with beautiful games, quotes the official WEFA de Rossie website.
It is difficult to play with blue, because they have not only unique styles but also clear individuals.
To leave them, we'll have to smell all the shocks and smell each other.
The Messianics are almost successful when they are in the process, so we need to keep compliance and organizationality.
He hopes to get out of the SCA in a sloveny machine with Slovan.

The next team's shop is going to go out against Slovenia.

Steven Hog uses a girl's phone to put the pedofils to send a photo
Pedofiel used a 11-year-old phone to request images of violence against children.
Steven Hog took a telephone before she was sleeping, registered into the Internet Service, where a number of unacceptable pictures received by other users.
The girl wakeed up, found a lost phone and found him in the hand of the sleeve of Hog.
She checked it and found shocked photos, after which she immediately focused on the attention of her mother.
The police came and saw five images after he investigated the computers found on this address, and found " appropriate " search system applications " by using words to discover inadequate images of children.
Gog then declared the police that he did it because it could "train the pedofils", and then he would "assum that he was a policeman to fear them".
The author of the judge, Elid Robertson, reported to the officer in Dani: "He said that it was a tragic, he tried to fear people.
He acknowledged that he requested the computer, but said that it was because he wanted to make a police to fear the pedofils.
He was asked about the conversation with an unknown person who sent his pictures and asked him to send more photos.

Captain Arsenal, Michael Artet says that his colleagues should support the traumated Jack Wilshire before playing "Dinamo Zaw"
In the conversation with William Winger, he also stressed that only September, and that, if the Wilshire's rebuilding was planned, nothing would prevent him to return to Christmas.
With the most appreciative development of the Wilshire events, at least four next games in England will have been clearly held and, taking into account the success, its participation in the Championship of Europe remains in the next year.
Both in this recent problem is that Wilshi had certainly completed the previous season with the only tragedy ship, and he was planned to return to the accurate aggressive style of game during the pre-session preparation.
Wenger: "The trauma does not threaten his carriage."
It's not just before the end of the living bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just a case.
This is not related to ships or traumas that it had happened before.
This may be related to medical point of view, but, as Wenger has allowed, there is a slightly risk of additional trauma for any player returning to the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant train.
According to the Primier Injuries Ltd, William has 23 different traumas, which have occurred with him for six years since his debt.
He also played only in 65 of 157 "Arsenal" games in the liga for the last five seasons.
If you look at the "Arsenal" schedule wide, you can note that in six of the eighth seasons, starting from 2007 to 08, "Arsenal" was one of the two Premier Line clubs, which are the most delayed days.
Wenger recognizes the possibility of shocking in the portrait, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of the raw statistics will continue in the last season.
"If sometimes, returning back to the trauma, you're vulnerable for some time - for that time you need to restore the strength and take the competitive advantages," said Winger.
Jack's enough young, and it's going to be.
I hope he'll restore physically, I'm sure that his carriage will be the one he's worth.
Arsenal starts the Championship campaign in Liga with "Dinamo Zagreb" and continues to play on Saturday with Chelsea and the next environment, with "Tethenham Hotspur" and Wanger intends to break up the composition.
Dr. Belerin and Aaron Ramsi did not come to Croatia, so they would like to play the mother Debush and Artite.
Wenger may also include Kiran Gibbs and Olivia Jyrus instead of Nacho Morella and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and to give a little preview to players that it needs," said Winger.
Although the Arsenal is unreasonable in the F group, the Maximim Station in Zagreb is the most excited in Europe.
"Deanmo" hasn't lost any of 41 masks since they've been able to pass the past season as "unbelievable".
On Tuesday night, the earthquake of 3,2 balls on the Ritter scale was affected by the station.
It was a tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is certain that Arsenal has relied the lessons received in the past season when the team has suffered a shock in the League of Champions from Monaco, and remains a weak hope to bring a club to the end of the Championship.
"It's an incredible wheel", noted Winger.
Arsenal has never done this.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am realized with the article.
We have anamions, but we're not dreams.
FriendsFest: Commodity show that offered us a serious lesson of man’s friendship
The absence of such stories is cut into the eyes, especially if you know how delaying men have become, now more than ever, while the level of self-assault among young men is up to 15 years.
This became the only major cause of death of men between 20 and 45 years of age in the United Kingdom in 2013, and men are three times more than women.
In trying to deal with the question of "the campaign against unfortunate life", the Year of Man announced a year in order to leave the calls of culture that does not give men to help when it needs.
The friend is in the center of this battle to take the calls.
Recently, more than 2.000 universities who show symptoms of depression showed that if the patient had a sufficient number of normal friends, the chances of elimination are being observed.
On the other hand, those who are not in depression, the circle of mentally healthy friends two decreases the possibility of mental disorders.
But, of course, that friendship works, it's especially necessary to be her.
When communications are managed by social networks when the style prefers, the rapid response is often more than the content of contact.
Our digital life depends on the need to be a strong, loved joy and success, even if the reality is a single rule of unity.
Such supernatural success depends on the fact that psychologists call for external values - money, edges, social status, the purpose of internal values, our internal efforts to personal growth and friendship, which affects our mental health.
And as you recently noticed one billion, a video player, you don't buy more luck for money.
The dignity of Friends is that they focus on this attention.
Each person was not defined by his work, but, likely, through the personality that had been encountered in association with friends.
Yumor Joey and the permanent chairs of Chandler, the moments of the football review, the remarks of the Russian race for Rachel, are all understood that men may feel that, even though they are often retained from the full study of their feelings.
As he said, Samarians: "I'm the role of listener for people who feel depressed and socidian, he stressed how even the smallest association of friends can benefit".
Often those who are treating us feel that they are not able to speak to friends.
The old teaching "living with this" is strong, as well as the feeling that a open discussion on problems can be understood as weakness.
Friends one of the shows that I'm in mind when I try to propose more continuously working arrangements for overcome.
It stressed the few moments of a man’s friendship.
With regard to my task, the bilateral status of telephones helps people at the time of delay, while long-term support is from the nearby family and friends.
So if you're visiting FriendsFest to Comedy Central in these weekends, where the party has completely restored decorations, why don't you take your friends to drink in Central Perk?
Or better, if you're seeing a single man at Starbucks, smile and say "Privet".
Before not mention what benefits a friendship can be.
Friends Serial shows the Comdy Central from the beginning and until the end, all 236 series, on the #FriendsFest
De Marie forgets the hole by helping "PSJ" to roll Malma
Anhel de Marie is equal to Blyth Matty and Edinson Kabani's murdered stones in the Malmaw gate.
Angel de Marie, debtoring in Liga Championian, killed a hole that lets the SJB to eat Malma's Tuesday.
This is the report on matching and game reaction.
Anhel de Marie and Edinson Kabani did their case when "Sen-Jerman" began their game in Liga Champion with extremely good winning 2:0 against Malmau at the station of Park de Prens on Tuesday.
De Marie lost a mine than four minutes after his first game was started in Liga Championian as a PSJ player to give the Championships to France, but they left a number of opportunities before, finally, increased their advantage when Kabani slaughtered in the 61th minute.
In addition to the "Real Madrid" and the daughter of the "Shatter" group A, "Pari" had to start a good game against Sweden Championships because they were not able to qualify triops, but to continue a series of successful games in the last three sessions where they arrived to four finances.
They were shocked, but it was not the best decision of Loran Blan to read the Zilatan Ibrahimvian in a attack and then replace it in the field against the team of his family city and club, in which he started his close carriage in 1999.
"This is not easy to win home or guests in Liga Champion, so to win with account 2:0, to bring the counterparts to problems and to play well in the protection, is a good start even if there are still moments that we need to work during the season", said Blan.
It's a lot more promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I regret that we didn't lose one or two more.
Ibrahimvich returned after the trauma in one of the replacement of the Paris team, which brought her nobody with count 2:2 in the "Bourdo" in the first weekly, but he took it on the back of the Di Maria's plan for the fourth minute.
The Argentinian attacker noted that as a player that could come to new levels in Europe, after he was purchased at the Martin Washington last month, and he proved why he fled from Marco Reratt to protect Malma and was beautifully completed the attack, sent the shooting Johana Willand's swimming snake in a deep edge of the door.
But if someone waited for a simple and great victory, it was supposed to be shocked.
"Malmou" who wins Seltich in the tribe of Offf to reach this stage, composed of nine world-level games at the beginning of the game, five protectors and two opposite defenders in the middle of the field, was a serious opposition.
But except Nicola Judjich's shooting, with a shooting shooting shooting over the door of Kevin Trapp for the 34th minute, they attacked a little bit.
In time, the " PSJ" pronounced himself by non-resultative transferers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahim, which only in the first half has been able to perform five attempts, and then did not have been able to handle the moon killed by Cabani immediately after the renewing of the game.
However, he showed himself much more slightly in the accurate passes, and it was the pass from Ibrahim, who was sent by De Maria to a closed shooting shooting that took place to Vienna for 52 minutes.
The second hole was finally forgotten after the time notes by Kawani, the slaughter slaughter slaughtered his sixth meat in the season after Ibrahimvich sent a meat sent to the field center from the left band of Maxwell.
This ended all the ideas that were in Malmau about the return to the game, and only the Virginia's wheels with a close distance did not allow David Luis to increase the final account before the replacement of Ecequiel Lavezy was not read in the most end of the match.
Malme's trainer, Age Harrede, later admitted that PSG was the class above his team, said that the Norwegian was the last game in the Champion League last December.
Since then we played only in Swedish liga, but it's not that level.
Qualification is inadequate.
"Pari" sweetheart!
It was a wonderful shop with them.

Economy news - Nobel Laurea: Globalization
Implementation of globalization processes should contribute to a reduction in the world ' s inequality.
The situation seems to be different, the difference in the income of the population in developing economy, instead, grows.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-educated workers, the primary scientist of the International Analysis Lab and the choice of the NIS, the Nobel Premier for Economy 2007, Mr. Eric Maskin.
In the past twenty years, the world has survived the unexpected growth of global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become more open.
Globalization Parties have predicted great benefits for the development of the economy.
"And these prognoses have been a lot", said Maskin.
For example, China and India have received a serious growth in GDP in the population.
But it is not so happy.
Globalization was expected to reduce the losses between the " minors" and the "minor" in poor countries, which are expressed in a large inequality of income, and the precise payment of work.
But in fact this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in its article "When the global markets have not reduced the inequality in developing economies", published in The World Bank Economic Review, which translated and quoted NEE WSE.
In combination with the economic professor of the Harvard University, Michael Cramer Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates the increased difference in income in poor countries while globalization grows.
The new global market has been specific processes.
To demonstrate them, Maskin sets four levels of qualification of specialists - A and B for the rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, specialists D from poor countries have no level of qualification to cooperate with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if employees from poor countries have increased payment by cooperating with B staff from the rich, D employees do not feel that their wages fall all over.
A comprehensive effect of internationalization of production will contribute to increased dispersion in the payment of work between two categories of specialists in poor countries and, respectively, increased in equality.
Crimer and E. Machine offered a wonderful beautiful model, an alternative Ricardian theory of comparison.
It will explain why globalization has resulted in income in inequalities,” says Foad Alexandres, a ordinary professor conducting the International Analysis Lab and Selection of Decisions, the Director of the NASMA Mathematic Department.
And as any powerful theory, I'm sure she's going to bring up the empire work in this area.
The problem of Eric Maskin is to increase the level of education of low-capacized workers.
However, the scientist noted that there is no means for its own workers, but the companies are not able to pay their training.
In such situations, governments, international agencies, NCOs and private funds may play a significant role as a Maskin.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in any case does not call for the stop of globalization that brings and produces its fruit as a GDP growth.

The Green Tribunal was soon slowly disrupting.
typical situation: Four officials are standing before the judiciary of the Court of Justice, listening to his recruitment to the work.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't give you a 110-strand order to comfort it, says Kumar.
If there's another cyrpikey, we're going to put all the buildings.
Kumar is a national Green Tribunal (NZT) judicial authority established in 2010 to stop the intense pollution of the environment that is subject to the burn economic growth of the last decades.
At that time, the Tribunal had been able to consider more than 100,000 areas related to air pollution, the collection of museums, geological developments, toxic waste and the construction of the Dam.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the building leading to pollution.
Incredibly high: For 60 years since the declaration of the independence of the forced industrial development of India, the women's jongles became one of the most popular and polluted countries of the world.
In particular, the problem is in major megapols where infrastructure is not insured for a delicate urbanization: the city is covered by meat power, the rivers are filled with pesticides and households and the rest of the living mass are discovered by new housing quarters.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the States, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modedi, since it is often the main cause of the cancellation of major investment projects.
Yes, in May this year, the Minister of Environment called the Court of Extreme and Incomplete.
Sometimes the court decides that it is really impossible to carry out a deadline in the court, and reaffirms the lawyer on environmental matters by the Council of Pandvani.
However, the incomplete dealers have a positive side; at least they put the responsible persons to be slaughtered.
"It's the main goal to overcome this system," adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has already abolished large buildings several times: the end of the airport, the electricity stations and hundreds of smaller equipment.
In this regard, people are also trying to forget: for example, during the discussion of the pharmaceutical company in Telagna, the polluted area of the fredder River.
We can close your manufacture, but we answer the economic consequences.
"Their people are losing their job," said Kumar.
However, such explanations do not always have a understanding of simple people whose life can change through one slope of the slaughter.
Similarly, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles for more than 10 years of entering the capital than the general insurance.
In spite of the extreme popularity and criticism, Svataнтер Kumar refused to reject this decision.
Instead, he stated to the Government of Deli statistics on the driving and outdoor car rental and made a proposal to purchase 10 000 additional bus, prematurely recognised the manufactures if they could comply with the same order.
As a matter of attention, the court began to deceive the sources of polluting such as calves, the quality of the fuel and even the road incidents, the public furniture began to smile.
But the worst theme of the principle court was a programme to clean the Gang River, with a depth of an anonymous Prime Minister of the last year.
When it comes to Gange is sacred for the rivers, the judges often stop to keep their emotions and move to cry.
You know what the word "heilig"?
Someone slaughtered the water from Gang on the statue of God, and there was a fecality in it.
You're continuing to smell the river because you think it's Gang, he's gonna take all our sins.
This is the river we worship and see what you're doing with her every day.
The cleaning of Gang is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project an anonymous new Government.
Today, the number of factual bacteria in the river exceeds the standard more than 120 times.
A year from 1,5 to 3,7 million of infections in it died from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi had even offered the Gang's Saving Fund for saving money from the sale of his costum, where he met Barak Obama and 455 other objects from his personal collection.
The ecologs have been accused of the polysm prize: the cost of $7,000 was purified while the river is required at least eight billion.
The Green Tribunal members agree that India is going to be a long way before it could be called by a developed country, but they do not believe that the value of progress should be ecological.
" In the developing country, the discussions on the environment are often understood as an unreasonable raw, " said activists of the 'Zoes Gang' Malika Bhannot.
The court is trying to find a golden medium between ecology and development."
