Right-to-left population triumph in Austria, 29 per cent in total
According to the preliminary results, the previous parliamentary elections in Austria have caused a sensible deficit of both parties that form the current large coalition, as well as a noteful strengthening of popular parties.
The Austrian Popular Party (EBP), where the position of President Wilhelm Molterer was seriously threatened, suffered particularly important losses.
On the contrary, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthie Jörg Haider, prepares a triomphal return on national political scene.
According to the preliminary results, socialists (SPUE) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the vote, the country ' s first political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, lost 5,5 per cent of the vote.
The AVP, who with 25.6 per cent lost about nine per cent of the voice, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major parts of the next war; in particular for the popular party, which has deleted the previous elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Before the beginning of July, when the AVP left the coalition, the popular party had considerable progress on the SP.
But the electioners were apparently punished to have left the government to shoot.
Since the first reactions faced with the results, speculations regarding the possible demission of the head of the party and the current vice-channel Wilhelm Molterer were announced.
The observers believe that this may occur since Monday at the extraordinary advice of the party's direction.
Such evolution would facilitate priority towards the outcome of the election result that remains the most likely, namely the renewing of the large SPÖ and OPP coalition.
However, in view of the strengthening of the two right-related popular parties - free parties (FPÖ) would have reached 18 percent and 11 per cent of the voices - the socialists expressed the fear of a recurrence of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populations (which was still unified, in 2005, that the CES was separated) on a common government, which even sustained sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he was willing to cooperate with any party and that he prescribed the return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently put on this development.
The last party to have access to Parliament is the Greens, but those were slightly lost and restored, among Austrian political parties, from the third in fifth position.
Of course, no other party did not strike the limit of 4 per cent, and has not been accessed to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: The relationship with India is risking to refrigerate
If it was not possible to resolve the problem of the Czechian researchers accused of the illegal coffee collection in India, it would follow, according to the Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs, Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain refrigeration of the Czech-India relations.
The Minister today will declare it in New York, after having met his Indian Pranab Mukherjee homolog.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, a certain refrigeration would occur," it confirmed after the meeting, which was taken after a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after talking, that executive power could difficultly be involved in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švacha, who was discharged from the accused and punished of an amendment, the Central Government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling, the case was put under the court of that.
"If a problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced for three years of prison, would be to call for a higher office.
Since then, it could request the release under warranty and wait for the judge in freedom, it explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner is expressed in the same sense as during the conversations.
"He advises to call for a Supreme Court, as a result of what it could be grateful," said the Chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the sentenced "a competent legal support", states the Indian Minister.
He also said that such assistance had already been brought from India.
"We want to keep the best relationships with India above, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians also recognize it," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to M.T.T.K., he stressed his partner that the Czech Republic granted a lot of importance to the problem occurred in Czech entomology.
"We consider the incarceration and the accusement of these Czechian researchers as a great misgrace," he says.
The Minister will ask whether he has obtained the promise to take care of the case from India.
"I have already received a lot of promises," he only found.
A Czech will fight for the sea fund
It is approached to an electronic card that is represented by Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
He is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the sea blue.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent sea fund.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," said the Italian judiciary Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty members of the United Nations division for ocean affairs and sea law.
His head, the Director of the Division, the Checa Judicist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and full time to another.
Labour and enthusiasm characterizes the dominant atmosphere.
The marine background has a little known world until now, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living bodies for the Unknown moment, which can contain the key for the development of cancer medicine.
A larger fund than the stronger earth
The literature states began from today to strike in the new submarine territories.
According to a United Nations Convention, they are in effect of their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaika.
This is especially the area of what is called the continental shelf, which is often extended to hundreds of miles from the coast of the given country.
This can, according to the Convention, exclude all the resources of the continental shelf.
"For simplifying, it is considered the part of the marine fund and its subsoil, which is a long-term natural continence under the sea.
It is extended beyond the borders of the Little Sea, often more than two hundred miles of sea, which represent the exclusive economic union", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted to the Commission for the establishment of external borders of the continental shelf should be supported by a broad scientific and technical documentation based on cost-based prospections and metrometers.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"The one of our roles is to provide the Commission for legal and scientific assistance.
To date, the Commission has been employed by five requests, of Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the moment they have known the success only the last three countries mentioned," adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, which was the first to have significantly expanded its submarine possessions, recently known a global retention.
The New Zealand also won from the territory - the extent of the marine fund, which the Commission has assigned the Commission last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square miles, which represents the expansion of the multiplied country by six.
The two countries have invested millions of dollars in prospections.
The benefit that they will shoot in the future of the operation of the marine fund will be, as they are planned, inevitable.
Progressively, other countries will, at their turn, submit their request.
They can do it within a period of ten years after ratificating the "Convention of Montego Bay".
There, where the continental shelf ends, the zone of the ocean fund, declared by the Convention "Common Patrimonie of Humanity".
There, no more state played with an exclusive position.
The right to extraction in this area is assigned by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But we don't, however, we're not a Klondike", said the director Mikulka, exaggering that "the areas are clearly defined and their regimes are listed in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the marine fund today belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other States of the ex-Bloc of Eastern countries in the framework of the Joint Inter-Oceanmetal Organization.
This has been achieved in 1991, in accordance with the Convention, as well as investors of some other States, the status of that called "un pioneer investor".
She has the right to extraction in the ClarionClipperton Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and the Kiribatis.
The investor's area is slightly exceeding the surface of the former Czechoslovakia.
The fund is moved there, it is a kind of submarine replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract it on a wide range with a total surface of 75,000 miles [5,000 km].
The area represents a rich polymetallic conceptions containing nickel, cobalt, and manguese," states Ind Pakshi Rajan, another judiciary.
Rober Sandev, a macedonian employer of the division, provides an example of such a creation.
She remembers a small earth poom, or well, with a little imagination, the mythic shoem, which, according to the legend, animated the Golem.
The German Special Forces were on the place for the release of detainees
The Egyptian Government had requested Germany's assistance to the resolution of the fighting crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were prepared, but they have never been in action.
More details on the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt are revealed.
According to the instructions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defence, the German Special Forces also participated in indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both federal military experts and officials of GSG 9 of the Federal Police and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as Technic Hilfwerk logistics experts were on the place of release.
As the Port of Ministers the Monday night communication, the German forces have not finally been required, the opposition princes who freed their prisoners and fled when they recognised the imminence of liberation by force.
The Egyptian Government would accept the aid offered by Germany to integrate it in support force.
"He has not arrived unfortunately until there," said a speaking door from the Federal Ministry of the Internal Ministry.
The aggressors took into the south of Egypt the group of tourists composed of five Germans, five Italians, a Roman and their eighth Egyptian companions.
After they entered the wilderness in the south of Egypt, the edges were transformed in the border zone between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and the Chad.
The identity of opposition primers has remained vague until now, as well as the details of release or possible ransom payments.
Those who were saved have arrived in a healthy time except in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the released casts were under the protection of the Ambassador of Germany.
He did not say anything about the details of liberation.
In Berlin for the time, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine “Image”, the five vacants and the special forces should have been collected at the edge of an Airbus in the air army and arrived in Mord Germany.
The Chamber of Representatives of the United States rejects the Safety Plan
The first room of the United States Congress has just failed to save the financial markets over $700 billion.
The Dow Jones was in the snake.
With 227 votes against 206, the Chamber of Representatives of the United States rejected the Government ' s relief plan for financial markets.
Despite all the calls of the President of the United States, George W. Bush and the political men on the head of the two parties, the programme that had to play the chaos of financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic handle, the parties tried desesperately to convince the opposites of the well-based plan of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debates, called the deputy to a favorable vote, even though the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he agreed.
During the further vote, Dow Jones was more than six per cent to 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state saving plan could lead.
He took a little time before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, he shouted again.
Experts now design new serious turbulences on international financial markets.
To enable the programme to enter into force, the approval and the room of Members and Senates are required.
The organizations report a growing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of reserves for the next months after a study, the business rate has significantly increased in comparison with the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30%.
Despite the weak conjonctureal perspectives, the soif of German travels remains insufficient according to this study.
Reserves for winter season, travel agencies registered a number of businesses over 31 per cent in comparison with the same period in the past year, as the German Travel Agency Federation (DRV) granted to Berlin Monday.
According to the GfK Market Search Institute, there are more reserves in the automatic months.
Thus, the sales rate would have increased to about 11 per cent in comparison with 2007, trusted in the DRV.
The sources of these results are GfK's figures, which annually analyzes 1200 travel agencies' reserves and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel reservations since the end of August 2008 would be registered.
Because of the low rate of the dollar, travels to the United States would be particularly requested, the DRV would declare.
There, the increase in reserves would be around one animal.
In addition to this, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our content would be specially searched for Germans.
The specially organized trips are requested, explaining the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increased energy prices and food products, the costs would be here "wise calculable for the customer than for an individual travel".
Consumers may economize the money between others with the reductions of pre-reserves or All Inclusivia offers, explained Laepple.
The summer months have also been very retained, so that a increase in sales numbers will be re-registered in comparison with the last year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who have entreprened a trip has decreased in comparison with the previous year.
My first time at the Bière Festival
Ballermann or Open-Ski's shoes, of bird in litre pitches and celebrates in tirolyan costumes to design.
A bird party event.
Suzanne Kronzucker and me, we haven't actually a big-chose in common.
It is blonde, television animator and takes a tirolian costume cut on measure.
I've got shocked hair, I'm a student, and my robber's on the time.
But one thing is connected to us: at least three minutes at the bird party, and the photos are already standing on us and fill their memory card - very flatting, and that's my first visit to the bird party.
That's how we get friends.
The good market cost seems to achieve its goal.
As a tourist of the bird's feast and normally living in the north of the Whitewurst equator, my feeling of well-being in the traditional cost was up to now limited.
But once on the theree place, it's half less worse.
Each or almost takes a tirolyan costume or sweet pantalons; no one has breathed or affected air - it's completely normal.
Only the table of my tirolian costume collects some strange shoes at the stand of the bananas-choco.
A bavaroise makes me note that I would have been badly attached to my table: "to the left you want to mean free, in the left environment, to the right castle, backward."
I'm disappointed, I'm thrilling my back to the left.
"It's better," she says and strict.
Others do not so bad for these subtitles of flirt and have simple fires, on which it is written "Too drunk to get clothes!" and we are exposing their back-train without being invited.
The young man at the exhibitionist attitude named Bob, arrived from England and comes for the first time at the bird party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-term "oooo".
He's telling me all about this after he's understood the shope he had drinked before.
On the side of this fire mouth that everyone believes that it is a powder.
Bob, therefore, is one of these "beauty pishers" tristely famous.
Others do not have the chance to be able to escape alcohol in this way.
On the eighth night, swimming ribs run on the party's place and need to take care of poor drinkers.
Infirmers, instead, are in myth - always by four, they spend their crowd of tears in the teeth.
This works so for most visitors of the bird's party. We'll be empty, we're back full.
Those who rest in the circle under the bowl are not visible.
"These are those who can't shoot anything anymore," one of the shooters shouted in response to my question then disappeared.
Police Unidentified Unidentified Unidentified Unidentified Unidentified
A 63-year-old pieton, deceived to the hospital after being raised by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Thursday after midday, in the city, in Shenfield Road.
She was transferred to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but then deceived.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because a suspected dangerous conduct was suspicious.
He's been released since, under warning.
Turkey extends its diplomatic horizons.
Before Turkey did not think to join the European Union, the European powers were sweet to enter into her back-land.
On the coast of Bosphore, 20 may not be, from Asia, one of the most ends of its imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha car was designed in a neo-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
This is at least what guides us.
The monument is equipped to the bottom of the platforms, observation tours at each of its angles, such as some German provincial mairies.
The stones are salt.
All the buildings are destroyed.
But once in the shopping ticket, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The car was inaugured in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the game of imperialism, wanted to realize its medieval domination ambitions by this flowway that arrives in Damascus, Bagdad, as well as the most known land under the name of Saudith Arabia.
But the German imperialistic ambitions were evacuated during the first World War.
His ice paths were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregularities.
The relative isolation of its region to the neighborhood, born by the glass borders of the Flood War, has been completed.
. The British and the forces of the Empire continued further to Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German partners outside Palestinian and Syria.
But there were also bad news for Hyderpasha's car.
In 1917, an explosive train of munitions destroying its subtle tower.
Turk sources say that it is a sabotage.
Since she was slowly defeated, including the meanders of the story.
But today, the rail passage to Anatolia and all the Eastern points, at least symbolically, is to emphasize the expansion of the diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The Justice and Development Party, the ACP, created a new foreign policy for the country.
The isolement of its region to the outside, generated by the Flood War glass borders
Now it is the time of a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relationships with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian Hamas and Fatah fractions, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I was shipped on a wagon-bed in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP AKP Turc Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
On the next morning, after a 10-hour trip, shooted on brushing rails with the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived, finally, in the capital of Turkey, as a new city of a new serial status, turning back to his German past.
But the ACP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an example of change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspicious the West, and in particular Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP General District, a ultra modern structure, expressly built in stones and steel, in a development district, covered by business centres to half-building centres and by many farmers in which the medium managers in slaughter and women meet for morning affairs.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a right-centur politician from any other part in Europe.
Costume, cravat, and he even has a Black Berry.
"The purpose of this foreign policy is to reintegre Turkey now in its immediate neighbourhood.
The cold war was an anonymity," he said.
Turkey was taken from her backland.
Now she must look at the East and the West at the same time.
That wasn't the case of the one and the other.
She should do both.
"But this is that at a moment, "I wondered if" Turkey should not choose?"
"The Turkey" said "does not want to choose between the two."
He then stressed a aspect that almost all those with whom I had spoken have reassured me with heart: the Turkish ferry road is not only to the Middle East but also to the Caucase, and around the Black Sea, is therefore a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to be drawn up a metropolitan Europe on Railways to Asia and the Middle East.
Returned to Hidarpasha's car, after another night without sleep, I recalled these two Germans, Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions in the Middle East could, mostly, be found within the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I remembered the period in which Turkey was called "the disease of Europe".
At least there are no doubts on the continent that could declare this fascinating country.
Remembers of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Musical Director at Gilldford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (deceased 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
When he was already part of his musical project for the city, he found the next year, the fantastic tears of young people, Proteus.
The breath had to include less than 21 years, but before Proteus can't sing his last song in 1979, many of us who had more than 20 years - refused to abandon the heart.
The name "Proteus" (when changed according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the heart to manage any kind of music to be presented to him, that it was madrical or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young heart was often impressive, always exciting, and that is thanks to the inspiration of one man, and to his enthusiasm for music, which remains constant in the years.
Remember how much the death was to say to us: "Let music speak for herself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything's here, in music.
So sing!"
His bagate technique was absolutely clear, accurate, even if never dictatorical or appearing.
Someone of the musical standard, he was very higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver had to be called cheval, it's Vernon Handley.
I well known him during the decades 1962 to 1982, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the past 40 years, I've revised more than one hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that no one of them never deceived me, and, a few times, they even inspired me.
The death of Handley stopped as rare this combination of size and modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "not focused only on some."
He would miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your necrology by William Woodruff (deceiving September 25, 1946) states that "he had repeated his studies in economic history in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he did a BSc, a MA and a PhD."
That's what is letter from Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at the University of Nottingham, and ended at the same time, a thesis of PhD on the British Plastic Industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; she was then published in 1958 under the British Rubber Industry.
In the 50s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and the summer 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for the Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to dismiss this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophie
"I recommend the exposure of José Vicente Resino " the Flamenco and Life " because its photos in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They attracted me to the fact that they are simple and the strength they transmit and because they are always treating the protagonists with much respect.
A exposure that brings many feelings.

Second smooth for the super sales of Honda
In November, Honda will start the marketing of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If his predecessor had already a good habitability, this new monovolume has a more larger internal space.
This adds some refined mechanisms, which increase the conduct comfort and allows to economize more essentially.
Evolution faced a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz presents a very similar line to the previous model, changes introduced in this monovolume are many.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it must be stressed that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the market of the first generation.
First, it is noted that Honda renewed this model in a shorter period than that of the other manufacturers.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon of sales on other markets.
This is Japan's case, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, almost a million Honda Jazz has been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with a million cars sold in six years, represents the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow him to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while the Japanese brand marketed 83.000 Honda Jazz in 2007, it thinks to sell 100,000, which would represent an increase in sales in 17% on the European market.
In Spain, Honduras has marketed 8.000 Jazz since 2002, which represents 6,7% of the sales in Honduras in Spain.
The responsibilities of the Spanish branch are expected to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
This is precisely the outcome of the new Jazz, which will allow Honda to break the sales down in Spain.
Indeed, the brand responsibilities expect to end the year with a sale of 22.000 cars, it is 4.000 cars less than in 2007, or a decrease of 16 per cent.
With this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain with a market share of 1.8 per cent, with a share of 1.6 per cent in the last year.
Japan's mark also hopes to get a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model will be out.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters of length - whereas the Nipon company hopes to commercialize about 200,000 cars per year in the whole world.
On the basis of the markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of Insight will be in the United States, while the remaining half of the rest will be shared between the Old Container and Japan.
The Insight's commercial launch is planned for the first three months of the next year, after its presentation to the public in January to Valence.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its sizes.
His length reaches 3,90 metres (5 centimeters above), its width of 1.69 metres (2 centimeters above) and the distance between its axes is 2,50 m, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
Instead, the height is not 1.52 metres.
The sizes increase and the internal space are also increased.
This gain was, on the one hand, to introduce a new platform and, on the other hand, to introduce a substance reservation in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of coffee - which has a double fund system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity in more than the cover of the first generation.
It must be reported that these dimensions are those of the version with a engine 1.4L, as the ability to cover Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - more than external elements such as back fires or panoramic toilet - is the improvement of access to back places.
The doors that give access to back seats have a 80 degrees open angle, including the back doors of the first Jazz that opened with a 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two essence propulsors of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both engines have a i-VTEC technology that reduces the emission and CO2 consumption, which makes the motor most powerful and increases the engine regime.
The first 1,2 litre motor develops a power of 90 horses to 6.000 tr/min and 114 Nm of couple at 4.900 tr/min.
The propulsor, who was on the previous Jazz, presents a consumption of 5,3 litres to 100 km and 125 grams of CO2.
With regard to the previous propulsor, who had reached 83 horses at the previous generation, now reached 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combinated consumption of 5,4 litres to 100 km and 128 CO2 grams.
The 'abell' smile that avoids collisions
To make progress in the development of the technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan has inspired it at this time, of nature, in particular snakes.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, imitating the fleet of the balls, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co's Advanced Technology Center Engineering Engineering in cooperation with the Centre for Sciences and Technology for the Prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General of Public Relations for Technology and Investigation and Marke Management, the BR23C represents the scope of the Nissan security bottle.
This robot will allow the brand vehicles to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each abel created his own personal space of an oval form that is very similar to the Nissan security boxer.
But the most important thing is that the eyes of the abel, which can see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within his own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have set out what is called a laser localist (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the barriers that are on a distance of two meters and in a radio of 180 degrees, calculate the distance to this object and send a signal to the microprocessor immediately to avoid the barrier.
"When he detects an obstacle, the small robot will switch the movements of a ball and will immediately change direction by bifing its 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The largest difference between any existing system is that evasion work is totally instinctive.
If so, robot would not be able to react enoughly to avoid obstacles, "toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Movement Labor and main engineer of this project.
On the contrary to a ball, robot can not be turned up to the top or down, or in diagonal; it can be moved only in two dimensions and on the basis of what its roots allow him and not in infinite directions like the sheets.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and detection, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
" Each second of this device should only treat information and act according to these data.
There is no need to keep the information or intuitive logicals of pre-relative workshops, so it can continue working with only a few twenty-five KB memory.
This can be surprised, but we don't speak of giga-octs of memory, nor of megaoctetes."
This represents the first cause of development of new collisions prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced in series cars in a decade of years after Nissan.
The robot walks with lithium-polymer batteries, which are slighter and dry more than lithium batteries.
The other possible application of this technology to the future could be the adaptation of this device to a satellite navigation GPS system to lead the driver to its destination by avoiding road barriers.
They're afraid to be hypothesis.
It should be recognised that the Treasury of the United States, in addition to having much liquid to make plans, is not disappointed by genes.
The crisis, and to avoid the Americans switching into hypothestics at solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: ' Bad Credit Hotel'.
It is to say 'The' Hotel of bad credits'... or history.
The luxury aspect of this accommodation and specially of the Hotel Master brings us to think several times if it is the right time to ask a loan.
And, especially, where to do it.
It is sure that this game gives useful but little detailed information.
It's a reserved game for adolescents.
What if the game is finished?
Because a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's impossible to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry to the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will be $9 billion to take 21% of his capital, a new welcome with a strong decline in the Bourse course.
One week after launching a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9 per cent of the ordinary actions Morgan Stanley to $25.25, or a total of $3 billion.
The stored price is less than 19% than the account value of titles at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the acquisition of convertible titles which provides an income of $31.25, as a result of a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall operation would be carried out on the basis of a average cost of $29, or 28 per cent above its current course.
The Morgan Stanley action, however, lost 6.79% to $23.07 at 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the banking status", explained John Mack, the Director-General of the United States Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but pass the fact under the Federal Reserve.
Their MUFG alliance also confirms that the current financial crisis imposes the largest names of Wall Street to adopt a more careful attitude than previously.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended during the last days: last Monday, Morgan had just announced that it would sell up to 20% of its actions in Japan for about 8,5 billion dollars.
"A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, explained that the participation would be fully composed of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimise the risks and cover us."
Based on the measured average price, MUFG will pay its titles Morgan Stanley 7% under their account value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of approximately 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement prescribes that MUFG will be able to convert its preferential titles in regular actions in a half year if these are exchanged by more than 50 per cent above the conversion price, or about 47 dollars during a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the MUFG's capital will enable him to enter investment opportunities, strengthen its balance and increase its liquidity.
However, a parliamentary port of the group refused to clarify the strategic projects of the two new partners.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a solution ratio Anima One of approximately 15%, one of the best sector.
Morgan has expressed "non-negative" alignment of its balance since the end of August.
The last weeks were triggered for the group, which saw his course of Bourse founded half while the insurance costs against a debtor risk were involved.
This was a midday, but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other " surviving" of the large Wall Street investment banks after the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers' firms and Merrill Lynch's purchase, announced 15 billion dollars, in part at the Berkshire Hathaway Group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa at Quito this Monday.
Reflect the Republic around socialism of the 21th century.
This is the common project of the Venice Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, instead of his homologues and friends, is the third who put a new Constitution project.
The mission carried out because 64 per cent of the elections voted "ji" in the referendum, according to official results of 80 per cent of the demands.
According to these results, "no" reached 28%, 7% of the demands were null and 0.7% were white votes.
In order to adopt the Constitution project, half of the demands should be obtained.
Thursday, two reviews carried out in the vote offices and a detaine of an non-governmental organization had announced a wide victory of the "ji", which was between 63 and 70 per cent.
Rafael Correa also returned in the Sunday night the winner of his Constitution.
The Constitution has triumphed in a strict way, assured the Equatorians at the Guayaquil Headquarters at 280 miles south-west of Quito.
As soon as you hear, Rafael Correa was welcomed by Chavez and Morales but also his Chinese homolog Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which has been in peace in accordance with the United States Observer Mission (OEA), was a text in 444 points that consolided the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The Constitution project is dedicated to the power of the State on the economy by reserving the "development planning" of a living country mostly the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the debts sent by its migrants.
Correa, elected in 2006, also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, which will be able to perform up to two consecutive mandates of four years and will have the possibility of dismissing the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it would use this power and will impose a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolids the principle of free health and education services that the President began to establish in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50 per cent of the population lives under poverty.
It finally prescribes the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an equatorial basis as the start point of the United States drug operations.
19 days were released in Chad
A Egyptian command launched the slaughter against the 11 tourists and their eight accompanies captured 10 days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight accompanied Egyptian accompanied captives for ten days in the wilderness have been returned this Monday after midnight and except in the capital of Egypt.
On the morning, they were released by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Aparently, the ships arrived at 15 p.m. 30 p.m. at a special aircraft at the Al-Maza Military Base, accompanied by the international Caire Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without ability to talk to the press, at the board of helicopters to the Hospital of Maadi, a residential bathroom of Caire, to get out of it.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the ravisers", said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna.
On September 19, at a safari in 4x4 at the foot of the Uanat Mountain, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of oppositions was shocked by a cache on the other by 35 unknown switchers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four chariots, a border garden and the director of the Aegyptous Agency, Safari organizer.
An Egyptian security official reported that 30 members of the special forces, walking on board two helicopters, had launched the assault in the right night before the birth.

The chief of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where there is, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result by professionalism and effectiveness of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without more details.
He also disbelieved the payment of a ransom.
The vel, the Sudan army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on the edge of the rabbits, killing in six, including the tchadian chief, and stopped two.
The army had stated that they were linked to a rebellious group of Darfour, the United Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately denied.
Letters - Most silent of the culture
A discussion on the financing of cultures makes smuggles and employs this election campaign.
It's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will stand up to condemn the poor ones that are granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological crowds, or the national historical places that are hungry?
What politician will remember the federal government that he denied his monuments and his heritage buildings?
What about Quebec, as in Canada, does we not have real laws that effectively preserve our patrimonie?
Did you know that the French government devote three million and half euros to the restoration of the only château of China in the Loire Valley?
In our United States neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the American culture, and that this patrimonie must be protected by all citizens, all elections and government departments in concertation.
In Quebec, the Québec History Society Federation, at least 400,000 voluntary people grouped in 211 history, patrimonies, archives and genealogic corporations, are concerned about the struggle of the history, to preserve with three of private archives and to preserve archaeological clothing.
These are often the dogs of our patrimonie, which protest with the energy of desire when promotors and decision-makers launch their bulldoers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a tribe for history and heritage?
Benelux Governments nationalize a part of the Fortis bank
The states of Benelux are supported by the Belgian and Dutch bank as the first European bank in depressing situation following the neighboring effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, nationalizing partly. The three countries support, at a sum of EUR 11,2 billion, this financial institution and insurance also have interests in Hungary.
This weekend, Belgian Governments, Luxembourg and Dutch agreed at the highest level in this case, calling also to the European Central Bank and to the competitive responsibility of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the framework of the international financial crisis has been increased for more than one year is for the Fortis bank, and the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will be pre-reached.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will save near half (of 49%) of the capital of the bank in each country.
The bank will, without doubt, sell a part of its participation, among which, firstly, the activities, mostly insurance, have acquired the last year of the Dutch body ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis actions started a vertile fall. In the second half of the week, serious crisis signs have already been revealed in the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let it go to the faillite.
Only Friday, the company's actions fell 12 per cent to reach the lower level of 14 years ago.
Since January, actions have been lost more than two thirds of their value.
In view of the current value of actions, the total value of the group's capital is around 14 billion euros, which, according to the corporate leaders, is not realistic.
The company's leadership condemns the uncertainty of other Atlantics, in relation to the adoption of the US Safety Plan of $700 billion, to be due to the fall of Fortis actions.
Thursday, the papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
Thursday, Philip Derrckx was appointed to the head of the bank as a new Director-General.
The financial body was also looking for private purchasers, but has not yet received a proposal on the fund.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not be worried about it, they would not lose their money.
No panic was resented in the circle of the bank's client and no agency has been arrested.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and also saved leasing companies.
A powder in the powder
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information on their medication purchase.
Information protection experts are afraid that the data market is uncontrolled.
" There are data protection programmes related to the use of information on the prescription of medicines, in all cases, to the agreement of the person concerned.
This type of program must be found among independent hands, except to resolve his polar to a rear" - recalled Richard Dicket, the program creator used to manage medicine requirements at Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the capital assured in case of damage, the customer health status that is present, and if they consider that the risk is too large, they do not even guarantee it.
For the past, they sent candidates to a medical examination, and they did not sign insurance contract with them only after having taken knowledge of the results.
Since ten years, Dick has found a very fewer procedure: from an identification number, it is easily provided with pharmacies, the data regarding the purchase of drugs of the person in the decade of months. As a result, the program itself determines what disease the person suffers and what his health status is.
For example, if this person regularly purchases strong doses of cholesterol reductor, it refers to a extremely higher grain rate in the blood, which then places it in a higher risk category.
several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, therefore, there is no greater thing to make the assurer from the paper. However, small problems can still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program, the fact that a medicine can be used for various purposes, for example, some melanges can be used against migraine or from heat bottles, but may also be effective against depression.
This is considered by assurancers as a aggressive risk factor, while others, no.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data, and they have to request the authorisation to the patient before collecting the necessary information to the pharmaceutical.
Dorenavant, they have compromised it by the authorities, even though they have not been sanctified for their lack of the past.
Since a few years, some companies are also treating laboratory analysis results, and are connected to data on the medicine consumption, and thus they are able to provide a further specific portrait of the health status of patients.
More companies have access to data, and the use control is parallelly more difficult.
There is a different law on the protection of medical data, but its action field is extended only to practitioners and assurers.
A legislative proposal on the enlargement of the authorities' control circle on business specialized in data delivery is now before the Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that it is not sufficient and that's why he has developed further before his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the excluding agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of knowing whether the person concerned is really free to give its agreement or not, because, if it refuses, the insurances do not sign insurance contract with it.
Thus and finally, the powders depend on the well-being of the rear.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are multiplied by two trade trades.
As the European Union and India are very important commercial partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this nineth sum side of the other problems, mostly globally.
Today, it will also be a Summit of France and India where nuclear energy cooperation will be particularly concerned.
The European Union recognized that India is a great democratic power that would have to give a more broader word right in international affairs, but Member States have not yet succeeded to agree on their support to New Delhi for its candidate as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
They were not too attracted to this issue last night at this nineth Summit organized in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as the Chairman of José Manuel Barroso and the Chief of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with which they have fallen in agreement that in five years they will multiplie by two trade exchanges, which means an increase of a hundred billion euros.
Bearing in mind that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods has been from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be too ambitious.
In that sense, they harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, and thus the air exchanges will also be able to take their shore in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union at the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the negotiations.
The objective is to balance the situation with one side, India, the first trade partner of the EU, and the other, New Delhi, which is only the nineth place among EU partners.
The Summit highlighted global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistanian situation has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the emergence of holding a United Nations conference on this subject.
The completion of the Doha commercial cycle was also requested, although both have a large part in the current failure.
The EU confirmed that it remained faithful to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce at least twenty per cent of its rejections of toxic materials until 2020.
India was also agreed on this point, as well as with the fact that a global market should be passed at the next year climate conference and reduced emissions of gases from 50 per cent to 2050.
They would also like to prevent increased food goods prices, and supported the convocation of an international working meeting to consider the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is today in the French capital, where a bilateral meeting is prepared to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the Press Agency information, the agreement would be 15 years old.
A Francfort, more than three hundred Italian editors
Fort presence of Italian editors at the International Book Hall of Francfort.
More than three hundred Italian editors present at the 60th edition of the Buchmese, the most important of you are international in the exchange of rights.
The International Book Hall of Frankfurt waits for this edition, more than 7 000 exhibits from 101 different countries that will take place at the 171.790 meters of the Hall with more than 403 miles of exhibition titles, and Turkey as an invitation to honor.
This will be the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Goods and CulturalActivities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, during the Papillon-Inauguration ceremony of Italy: in fact, Italy will be in institutional manner, with a Italian point 264 meters of exhibition.
It will be monitored with the press in the Structure Room at the pupil 5.0 of Buchmese: an opportunity to present the numbers, trends and perspectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to data, the importance of foreign author books is progressively reduced in comparison with the total Italian production, and in particular with that for adults and children.
He found Steve Fossett's aircraft, the Milliardary was gone a year ago.
The sword of Steve Fosset's aircraft, the Milliardary was lost on September 3, 2007 while he flyed on the Nevada wilderness.
The debris were found on a 3000 meter height plateau, in the Sierra Nevada of Mammonth Lakes area, at the border between California and Nevada.
In the aircraft, however, there is no human rest.
The sheriff of Madera Council, John Anderson, forgetted the doubts remaining: "The aircraft has been localized, we sent a team, and now we have confirmed that this is good about what Steve Fosset traveled on the day where he was gone," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains have been found on the aircraft or outside.
In February, 63-year-old age was considered deceased.
The United States Transport Security Office (Ntsb) informed that a few hours after the sword reparation, a research team sent on the places, identified the machine: it was well Bellanca 8kcab, who was disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset decolled Gerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Last night, in California, not far away from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple in the nearest room of Mamoth Lakes.
This is two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Ireland, the species money and a poll.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The Milliardary wins a place in the history through a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complement the world's tour on a aircraft ball: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he made the tour of the world in an aircraft and without scaling.
Among all these records, also the one to steal at 15.445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a copilote.
Glk, the advertising you don't wait.
A 4x4 out of the community of an original and well defined design, on the marked lines, on large surfaces and net angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of the "compact" road off of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to make a new wind in this sector.
Just from its standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will comply with the starting of 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showroom, from 17 October next.
Thus, the advertising battle that will comply with the start of the new car will take place in an unreceived communication mode, through a future 3D showing campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A maxi showing project, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of the Milan shopping, Corso Como, up to November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides the presentation of the stéroscopic car, and thanks to special lunettes distributed to Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and three-dimensional format.
Indeed, there will be the impression that when we look at the image, the auto starts out of the display.
Then, through the use of the innovative technologie, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, to be composed of a unique image.
Of course, with this advertising, Mercedes tries to introduce something again in the stereotypical area of the automobilist communication.
Will she resolve with this form to raise the interest of the future purchasing? We will see well.
This is the Italian hooligans.
Triveneto, they're risking the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls that Italy has now hungry? They are part of the "Ultra Italia" group that follows the Italian national team for years, which has never created great problems.
He never had been hurted with the adverse tifosis.
The extraction of the group is right.
Promotors come from Triveneto.
De Verone, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (peu in reality) of Campanion and Poland were added.
They had three-color dragons on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday night, they were all taken to not be identified.
They're impressed from the English strike.
In Bulgaria, they found a strike of real nazis, the Levski.
The Figc had available Italian tifosis, 144 tickets for the part: all nominative and therefore easily controlable.
And the Viminal had all controlled them: among those who went to Sofia, no one had had an existing Dapo, no one was banned to frequencise a stage.
Four Italian tifosis who had stage crimes had no right to the ticket, and couldn't be moved.
Now the Viminal expects to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police, and will then take steps: in that case, it may be that tifosis arrested or identified in disorders clean a Dapo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits to frequencise Italian cities, but also Europeans.
Unfortunately, our hooligans willn't put up the stage.
Happy.
But now it's the time of fear and emotion: it is to say that others are risking to add to hundreds and fifty firsts.
"We have to extend this fire immediately, and do not legitimate those who do so," supports the Viminal.
So, "Give the well open eyes, especially in view of the match of the National Monday Times Team"
In the Pools, there is actually a small cluster of Italian Ultra supporters.
Tomorrow, the Observatory is meeting, the Casms, which may even take account of a Asian Section, is to say secret services, which are just about stage problems.
"The twenty-two shoes, and the arm heated during Mameli's symptoms, in Bulgaria, isn't it a crime."
This is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the post of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously in Trieste where a knee of supporters of the Ultra Italian group was founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli said, that in Bulgaria, the lovers of Mussolini is not a crime, but it is sure that the behaviour of these 150-200 tifosis has been honourable.
"I am not a sociolog - adds paragraph 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be assigned in the country where the fact happens.
Until now, this group remained in the rules, we will now see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the skin of Mameli: those there are no crimes, but if you allow me, they're not police..."
