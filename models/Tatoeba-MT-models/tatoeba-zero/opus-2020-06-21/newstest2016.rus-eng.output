The social map of the Jewish area is recognized by electronic payment.
The changes provide the maintenance of rents in the public passenger transport.
From 24 September, it is changed to the organisation of the rent passenger of citizens using the social map of the Jewish area.
According to the press office of the Government of Russia on the Ivan area, changes provide the maintenance of rents to the public passenger transport and provide a schedule of interactions on the social map, in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 161 FZ, the National Payment System.
The social map of the inhabitants of the Ivan area is recognized by electronic payment.
Consequently, the conditions of its application are changed.
Yes, the completion limit is now not at travels as previously and in the amount of money, with the maintenance of winter and summer periods, not more than 400 rubbers in the summer period, not more than 800 rubbers in the current month.
The social map owners of the kitchen vehicles now need to be monitored not the number of remaining trains, but the rest of the money.
The value of a loan passenger for the citizens is of 1/2 tariff in the transporter.
The remaining half of the cost of the passenger is the environmental budget.
The graphic of complementing the social map of money remains previously - in the period from 24 of the previous month to 23 of the current month.
The new schedule of social map travel will have a number of advantages.
Similarly, a detailed account of the expenditure of money on the social map was given to the copy.
Furthermore, there is a possibility of returning, but not expenditure of money.
We also add that the schedule of interactions with transporters is transparent, since the half of the cost of the passenger pays the citizens, and the same amount is exactly reimbursing the budget.
No committee will be cut off when the money cards are incompatible.
On the other hand, Vasilie Silikin, the Representative of the Department of Trade and Transport of Ivania, reported that in 2014, more than 33 million travels were made in the region with the use of a social map, about 25 million travels in 2015.
More than 470 million rubbers are prescribed in the area budget for the provision of the money passenger of citizens with the use of the social map.
As at 1 September, the reimbursement for these purposes was more than 312 million rubbers.
At the time of the call, the employee is recognised in the murder of a friend
During the call at 911 votes, almost without the driving driving of Shannon Lamb, the police told the police that he shot his friend and that he needed staff who would have come home to them.
Lamb emphasized that the house had a pocket that was alive, but it was probably disastrous, and said that the contacts of the members of the family could be found in her phone.
In the house of the police found the body of Amy Printis and the note written in a white letter: "I'm very sorry, I would like all back, I love Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, as the representative of the organs signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who made two online curses at the University of Delta in Clyde, Mississippi, had been able to go over 300 miles to the University Camp where, as the police, he shot all of the respected historical historian of Italy Shimed at his office.
The police head of the University of Delta Line Buford reported that university staff had learned about the shooting at 10:18 morning.
He reported that Lamb did the true call at 911 soon after that.
At the end of the day, the victims were more: Lamb ended with her when the police was surrounded.
On the next day after the shooting in the training, students and employees hidden by closed doors, the bodies still tried to make a model of motivation that Lamba built.
The information shared by researchers at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew it helped to compose talents, but may be worried to the teacher.
The students told them that they were waiting for his occupation.
The police in Gotia, where Princis died, reported that there were no accused of violence or crime.
Schmidt himself included the Lamba written in a book in which he expressed appreciation for the "beauty people" with whom he had settled in his preaching life.
Both were presented to the Social Science and History Faculty, which contains 17 providers, and many students visited lessons.
At the same time, some proposals were made to face problems.
One student, who was well calling about Lamb, Brandon Bivers, reported that he was very nervous and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Six, reported that Lamb at the end of the 2014-15 school told him how he was fighting with stress.
Lamb requested the University of the Delta to give him a license for sickness, said he had some health problems.
In this year, he provided only two online curses.
The recent changes in the university rules were that the doctor's stage, whose work was so slowly worked, would not guarantee the automatic receipt of the prosecutor post.
The President of the University of William LaForge reported that he had nothing to know about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "evidently, Mr. Lamba had something in mind".
These are questions that Lamb can't answer.
The police attacked Lamba after his flying from the camp when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was able to arrest, Lamb was shooted from a resident of 38 calibra on the back of the house, a mile south of the house of his parents at the Greenville camp, Mississippi, reported King of Washington Metel Johnson.
His car with the driving driver was still standing on the road.
It was unexpected why Lamb came to this house, although Johnson said, she believed that he knew the people living in him.
Lamb grows in those lands.
Lamb began working at the university, which was 3500 students in the city with about 12000 people in 2009 and provided geography and pedagogy.
He received the stage of the doctor's pedagogical science in the same early year.
One of the old friends of Lamba described it as a wise, charistical and fun.
Karla Haarston told her that she was 15 and 20 years old, when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were learned in older classs, and he was a classic boy afternoon who tried to learn to play her on a guitare for a few years.
In those years, he was able to use women’s success.
All the girls were thin when he was closen," says Hairston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jesson, the Brandon's emperor.
Lamb and Princess at the moment of the events, looks like they have met some time.
During the call at 911 Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage.
A couple had a song named Lytning, who lived with them in Gotya in a surgery house, which was the side of the channel.
According to the police, the dog's all right.
The former husband of Princess, Shawn O'Stin, reported that they had grown 15 years ago, but they remained friends, and that they had a daughter now 19 years old.
"It's totally sweet," told O'Stin about the daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lambo, but he heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Princess when he and Abigail were both talking about a summer celebration three years ago.
Then they played together from time on the ports.
O'Stin told his daughter's music and poet.
Princess was a nurse and worked online on different companies.
Mike Shafer, barmen and jointly developer coordinators in the bar opened by the Julep Room in the front of Gotia said that he last time saw Lamba and Princess on September 5, when Lamb finished playing on a guest and a sweet snack for few visitors.
No suspect has been observed.
"There's a happy couple," he said.
We were pleasing and entertaining one another.
They both were very strict.
Schmidt, who was dead, conducted first-curants seminars and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, reported Don Allan Mitchell, the English speaker in the same education.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas, Empore, and was the President of the Study Brotherhood and Study Selbst-Government.
At the Cleveland University Camp on Tuesday, about 900 people, including universities, staff, students and community members, participated in the Memorial Championship.
Ms. Schmidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt were also attended at the ceremony, during which the university's brain crowd was Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Adoptions will be re-elected in the medium.
"We're trying to return our students," said Laforge.
Crisis's gone.
Today's recovery day.
Amy and Rochelio Solys reported from Clilland, Mississippi.
The report was helped to prepare the authors of Associated Press Emily Vagster Petetus in Greenville, Mississippi and Rebecca Santan in New Orlean.
Material was adjusted with regard to the police statement that the call Lamba had been held in the service of 911 after the murder of Schmidt, as well as with the fact that Lamb had spoken about Printis as his wife when he called on 911, the information that they had been married was not confirmed.

Toys R. Us believes that it would not be the same staff at the celebration season as last year, with the player and the goods for children, it believes that it will provide state staff and temporary staff to work more hours.

Michael J. Fox is talking about the witnesses with the princess of Diana
The first film "Nazad in the future" was for Michael J. J. Fox's granious event.
She was noted for personal reasons.

Head of the United Nations claims that there is no military decision in Syria
The Secretary-General, Pan Guy Mun, reaffirms that Russia's military support was made by the Syrian military support that for almost five-year conflict " there is no decision," and the growth of weapons only affects violence and suffering for millions of people.
Head of the United Nations again called upon all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join and support comprehensive negotiations to find political decision.
Mr. Guy Mun stated that it plans to meet with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France during the Ministerial Session of the General Assembly in this month for the discussion of Syria.
He regretted that the disagreement in the Council, as well as among the Syrians and the local authorities, had “the situation of the unexpected”.
Mr. Guy Mun called for five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated in addressing the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in the consideration of Syrian crisis.
8 Survey results show that Donald Tramp does not smile
Some tried to smell him a shooter.
Others were disappointed from him as a shock.
Some need a scandale.
However, as some Republicans are trying to generate the high situation of Donald Trampa in the results of the surveys, they could not (together).
Decades of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trampa in two-dimensional numbers, and some start to ask what this means for the magnifying of the possibility of receiving a namement.
Of course, it's just starting a election cycle.
Nothing does mean that Tramp has the opportunity to be appointed by the Republic of Party.
Experts pointed out that in 2011, Rick Perry had introduced her best-being popularity in Germany Kain, who had not entered any State in the appointment process.
And there are many reasons for which he would have been fighting in general elections.
But external groups, such as the "Political Actuality Supercommittee" Jeba Bush, and the Conservation Group of the Growth Club, recognize the unleavened trampa force and begin to bring their dollars to prevent it.
These are some survey digits that say that the magnets of immobility are not just a interim phase:
The symptoms of the trampa have turned back to 180 degrees.
Once Donald Tramp anonymous its candidate in the middle of June, Monmouth university showed that only two of the 10 republics were positively treated with this magnet in the area of immobility.
It was 40 per cent in the midst of July.
It was 52 per cent at the beginning of August.
Six of the 10 Republicns are now positively related to Donald Trampa.
About three of the 10 says that they have a negative view.
And all of these indicators take up the main stages.
The question of Quinnipiac in Iwave last week showed that 60 per cent of the Republic of the Republic were regularly related to Trampa.
Two thirds of the voters for the GOP would have established Tramp as a candidate.
In the question of the CNN/ORC last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they had been "refrigerated " or " satisfaction " if the Trump would become candidate.
Only two of the 10 says they would be "repressed" if he was a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates the same level as the Tramp (43 per cent of them say they would be "retroduced" against 40 per cent of those who say the same thing about Tramp).
Next at the level of relief?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicns say that they will not be " satisfied" or "repressed" if the protocol of Jeb Bush will be a candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider the temperature of the Trampa.
While the Trampa is massively criticized for his joy and distress, 52 per cent of the electoral Republics throughout the country believe that the Magnate is a suitable temperature to be the President, as stated by ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
Similarly, the number is the first country of the closed congregation in the State of Aiwa, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicans believe that he is the one who may be the main team, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent believe that he is not a person who can be effective to post, and almost six of the 10 independent electors say that his temperature is not for the White House, according to the ABC/Post message.
The Republican electioners tend to this idea.
When they're shocking their shoes, the Republican electioners think that the Tramp is a stroke.
The question of whom was the most reliable winner in the GOP appointment, four of 10 said that Tramp was favorite, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
That's no longer when four of the 10 were put to Jaba Bush at the end of July.
Full discharge: GOP electioners had never had the right magic crisis before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 republicans elected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent were supported by the possible candidate of Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP electioners are considered a trampa campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans would be shocked around the other candidate, Tramp remained forward to all the other.
Some have indicated that such disappearance probably plays on the advantage of Trampa, and that the not supported trampas are equally distributed among more than ten other candidates.
However, the survey by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that the hypothetic " one " between the Tramp and most of the Republican candidates is almost always supported by the majority of the Trump.
He encountered Carly Fiorin for 13 items, Marco Ruby on 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jab Bush on 19 points and, finally, Randa Pole, John Casich and Christ Christi on paragraph 33.
He has nothing with Ted Crewes.
The only candidate who's going to do it?
Ben Carson has shocked businessers at the total of 19 points in the hypothetical renovation of one.
More than half of Donald Trampa's partners say they're thinking about it.
The new CBS/NYT survey shows that only more than half of the voters who support Trampa are sure in their votes.
Of course, many may happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he never changes.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, the most pressed competition in Trampa is now with a colleague-autsider of Ben Carson, but the electors who say they have thought that they would probably choose Trampa.
Six of the 10 Republicns say they agree with the Tramp on Immigration.
Since Donald Tramp two months ago called immigrants from Mexico in their open-ended campaign, the theme of immigration became the most active in the discussions in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trampa's garage will reject the key elections from the Republic of America from the Republic of America and prevent rebursement.
However, in accordance with the question of ABC/Post held on Monday, six of the 10 Republicns said they agree with Trampo in immigration issues.
Thus, until the immigration has a general attention, it seems that Donald Tramp remains at the same position.
The disaster of the Government has made new trafficking.
Donald Tramp and Ben Carson are now supporting almost half of the Republican electioners, mainly because of their status of athsayders.
Six of the 10 Republics on Monday, ABC/Post states that they may wish political athletes than men with experience in the Government.
They're also buried at Washington.
The question Des Moines Register/Bloomberg, held two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iwai have been disappointed by the activities of the Republicns in the Congress, with 54 per cent of "unsuccessful" and 21 per cent of "on succeeding".
The Government shall decide on the court of pension indexs in October.
Vice-Premier RF Olga Holga Holocaust said that the Government now seeks an application of the Pension Index Act in 2016 to a real inflation level.
She noted that the decision should be found at 8 October at the time of the draft budget for the next year to the Government.
In addition, Cambodia discusses the option for proliferation of the decisions on the raw pension of the Russian assaulting pension.
The head noted that the amount of pension captures equal to 350 billion rule.
The amount of pension indexation should be for the next year.
According to Vice-Premier, there is no final decision on the question of whom should pay contributions for unemployed citizens.
The Chief believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not relate to the socially protected categories of citizens, it is not absolutely fair that it pays the society for it.
The media previously reported that two options of the guest balance were considered in the castle.
Why are they often disappointed and redden?
The doctor-oftalmologist Tatiana Levashwa answers:
Our centuries are the widths that protect the eye ball from the multitude of small parts that are on them.
When we forget regularly cleaning, we often contribute to the development of the literature.
Easy Output:
Don't tried the eyes of the slaughtered hands, and take a special silver for the dwelling;
It shall not be 1-2 times a day purify the land from those covered in them for the day of harmful substances.
cleaning procedures are not limited to complement and warm compressions with the disasters of milk breasts (shalfey, routines), smell secrets of salt irons, and then a mass of swimming edges, which should be carried out by rounding thresholds;
Smoking the maquillage, do not use spot-containing means.
They smell and discharge the skin and contribute to further protection of the secret of salt irons.
The Phone claims that the Korean nuclears have created a atomic fighter.
North Korea's authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country was the nuclear complex in Yunban.
The report was presented on the website of the Headquarter of the country's Telegraph Agency.
It is noted that the CDR is ready to respond to the "agression and nuclear threat of the United States" and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons as a number and quality.
The last test of nuclear weapons of North Korea has been carried out in 2013.
In that regard, the reactor ' s full rebuilding plans have not been reported since then.
The Phone claims that he could create an atomic fighter.
Also, the CDR has tested a medium and little duration, writes polit.ru.
The Jürin was necessary to get out of the Russian giant to mention the brothers.
Leader LDPR Vladimir Jyrinus believes that the national ring should take note of the association of the brothers' peoples.
In this regard, he declared during the Gosmith meeting, reports the Russian news Service.
Who are these people now?
Fashists and murderers!
"The longest jinn, the longest in the world, even the sports are not overlooked," said Jyrinow.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all fourths in which the building is included:
In the late 2014, Jürinus stated that the current jinn had to be replaced by the "God, the king of the guards" and the Russian tricolor to replace the Imperial fleet, writes polit.ru.
Asad urged all forces to join terrorism.
The President of Syria Bashar Assad urged all forces to join terrorism.
Asad is sure that if Europe wants to address the problem of refugees, they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe takes or does not take refugees, but that it is necessary to eliminate the first cause of this problem.
If Europeans worried about the judge of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our view of this problem.
"In this matter, the question of refugees," he said in the interview.
We must continue dialogue on behalf of consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are not possible until people die, until blood is continued and people feel fully safe.
"So we can achieve consensus, but we can't realize anything until we won terrorism in Syria," said Asad.
Remember, this year, some 5000,000 migrants arrived in the European Union, including Syria.
The European Union stated that the current migration crisis in the world was greater since the second World War.
It is not excluded that among the arrival of migrants in Europe, thousands of the extremist group "Islam State" might have been able to be fighting.
Members of the terrorism organization prohibited in Russia may use the situation to create their cells in the EU to conduct terrorist activities.
The people of the German city have built a festival for refugees.
In the last month, Germany became a refugee leader, although recently she has enhanced the border control to keep them pressed.
According to the authorities, about 8000,000 migrants will arrive in Germany until the end of this year, although some experts are called significant numbers.
Since September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
Correspondent Bí-bi-si Jenny Hill was located in the city of Darmstadt, whose migrants are very warm.
Jeremy Corbin deals with the questions of the Prime Minister
After elections, Mr. Corbine has been dealt with the matters of the Prime Minister ' s session
The new leader of the Lebourist Party, Jeremy Corbin, will immediately take place at the meeting of the Premier Minister, first measured with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will speak with the first six of the second half of the issues in the second half of the day; for his statement, the press and the members of the Parliament of the Leyborist Party will probably be able to follow the press and members of the Layborist Party.
He spoke with a call for "lower theatre and more facts" for a weekly demonstration.
He also said that he could leave some meetings by leaveing them to the colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as a leader; it will be held after the appointment of the Tennis office and his speech at the Thursday annual convention.
At the time of the decision of the leader of the lebourists, the national giant at Tuesday, the 75-year-old Bishop of Britain expressed a criticism from a number of conservative members of the Parliament and became the subject of a number of previous articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbina did not smell the public jinn
Mr. Corbina, secretary, stated that he was "in almost silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal VS in the Beatwe for Britain".
However, a member of the Tenor Office, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, reported Newsnight to BBC 2, that he would recommend the leader of the library to sing a national "independence" from his confidence in the need to cancel the monarchy.
A few ten ministers refused to play in the team, Mr. Corbin, with a difference in economic, defence and international policy, while at least one sixth members of the parliamentary party supported it as a leader.
The Political Representative BBC Robin Brant said that political differences are also “coated” in the library party after the appointment of Mr. Corbin to post in the European Union and the limitation of compensation payments by the Government.
Mr. Corbin stated at the Conference of Thri-Unionians that the Laybourist Party had amended the idea of the limits in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Dark Minister of Labour and Pensions stated that there was a "complete clearness" in the party so that it was only in the opposition of Government plans to reduce the higher limit from 26,000 feet to 23,000 feet.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the lebourists whom David Cameron meets in the "Corry shop" for the last ten years since it was the leader of the Conservation Party.
The leader of the lebourists, who promised another approach to policy, states that he had “approved collective resources” to take the ideas of Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
The Member of the Parliament from the Irington North stated that the question of the Prime Minister is a extreme conflict, and that it would be able to maintain and strict responses and exchange of college, instead of concentring serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems that were faced with young people.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angel Ygel, Minister of Economy in the Canadian Tower, would vote on the matters of the Prime Minister when he would be missing, for example, when Mr. Cameron is outside the border.
He also heard the idea to allow other brothers to speak if possible, saying that he had addressed the spyner of the John Bercou Community to discuss this issue.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to go from the political style of the " marine balance " often associated with the procedure of the Prime Minister but acknowledged a few years later that it couldn't.
Since the first transmission in 1990, the Prime Minister's issues became the key indicator of leadership, their ability to manage the Party of the Community and Reputation to other members of the Parliament, although the critics claim that this has become a career and requires wide reform.

Burberry's actions increased by 0.9 per cent on the basis of the competitive news from the competitive product group of Richemont class producers.

Metcash launchs the initiative to fight on Nazi Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA purchase from the Aldi button in South Australia and Western Australia.
The OECD Food Manufacturer launched a market share of IGA rituals in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the future income of Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is prepared to open two optimum components and first of 120 businesses in South and Western Australia at the beginning of the next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening the relationships with local food providers and through the IGA market through leading media and social networks and the type of "Adelaide Show".
The campaigns join ritualists and suppliers of IGA, such as the manufacturer of the marine Simmo's in Dansboro, which offers a degust in IGA shops, and owners of shops sold by permanent tickets to the football League of South Australia.
It is expected that Metcash will develop more details of its protection strategy on 29 September - day when the advanced supplier of food, drinks and substantive products will take place on its annual day of investor strategies.
There is a small number of extents, since in South Australia and Western Australia, the IGA shop is almost 30 per cent of all Metcash shops and shows higher rentability than the Metcash IGA network in Eastern States.
The purchasers in South and Western Australia are known as ad hoc routes, so the market is more favourable for IGA riders than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland states, more than 30 per cent in Southern and 24 per cent in the WA, compared to approximately 14 per cent in Eastern States.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi is 5 per cent of the food market in these two states for 12 months after the opening of its first shops, taking the number of events in all present players, but mainly in independent rituals.
In the report published this week, Tom Kirat, Morgan Stanley analysis, believes that IGA rituals can lose $360 per year and Metcash $2,2 million to the end of 2016.
The project is based on the permission that Aldi is opening 25 shops in SA and 30 WA in the next year, purchasing $500 million and $600 million respectively on these markets.
The loss of the feed and sales of food at high-level Metcash costs may contain about 13 million income for payment and taxes, Mr. Kyrat.
At the same time, Metcash lost the share of the market in Eastern States, mainly from Aldi and Coles, and this is the recent study of Morgan Survey found that the most faithful purchasers of the IGA have been in the IGA.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash food sales will be 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reduced market company rates from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent to 2020.
Last week, the fund manager Hamish Dugolos, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, noted that Metcash could " with high chances to disappear during the decade.
The Metcash company refused publicly to comment Mr. Duclass' comments.
But it is suggested that the member of the Directors of Metcash company had been linked to Mr. Dugles last week.
The rate of IGA in the market was decreased from 2010 from 18 to 14 per cent, and Metcash income from food products undertaken by some 1200 IGA rhythms was 43 per cent, compared with 2012, as a result of the operational defence and the pressure on sales and retail rates.
However, the company is not payable, more than $1,1 million annually because of balanced prices in Coles and Woolworths for thousands of weekly positions, and helping IGA rituals to rebuild trade areas, as well as proposing a rapid expansion of raw products and more wide selection of corporate food products.
The Director-General Metcash Yen Morris said that the balance of prices and the restructuring of trade areas is covered by trafficking, and hopes that the company will be increased in the purity of arrive in 2017, first for four years.
Tanasy Cookinskis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hile
Tanasy Cookinakis is worthy, not critical for his conduct.
Tanasy Cookinakis has recently suffered in a skandal around his friend Nick Kryross and has more than critical, as President Tennis Australian Steve Hilli says.
Cookinakis, a younger in the talent and often called Special Ks, was not volunteerly in the centre of Cyrus's shocking with Stan Wavernick on the Montreal Masters tour.
Shortly after that, in the time of a heavy qualification match in Cina, the judges had two times to discover Cokinskis and his opposer Ryan Harrison, said, "The Bavariank had to put on the Kyross balls, and I have to put on the shooting of this guy."
When Cookinakis last time saw a shooting missile after his feet saved Rishara Gaske from the possible struggle on the United States, Hili protected loyally the Cookinskis.
Young people are currently in Glasgo, with Sam Grood's right to be second after Bernard Tommych in the single quarter of Kuba Davis against Britain.
"I'm so worried about one thing, namely that Tanasy had been in the conflict," said Hilli.
He really broke a missile when he had a feet open to the US, but he wasn't the first player who shooted the missile when the hope was shooted, and I know Tanasy's enough good enough to be sure that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he had a very well-bearing situation in the United States, with Harrison and etc., and I'm sure he would be trusting.
He's around a nice team, he's a beautiful family, and I just think he's done a little unhonorable.
He's a very nice 19-year-old man, he works very much, well in the team, he has never had problems with other players, respects it outside the corte, he trains intensively, he is a very widespread, very fully developed young man, and I think it should be assessed by dignity.
Hilli also supported the decision to forgive Kyroos for the important shop that started on Thursday, thinking that the "common agreement" is right for all, but considering that the man from Canberra returns to the team as a long-term player.
"Before all we want the team to focus on the match, not on the conversation around [Christos]," said Hills.
And I think that Nick has made a very fast power that proves to people like the Federer and Marrie, he grows up in the public, lets a number of serious errors and benefits all the critical that he receives, but we try to help him understand the consequences of his action, and I need to take him out of the centre of attention for some time to think about them, and that's better for the team and the best for it.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency situation, closes the border, delays migrants
When Hungary announced an emergency situation, in the Tuesday, the border with Serbia was crossed in the south of the border and delays those who try to go into the country unlawfully to keep the flow of migrants within the river.
A hundred migrants were covered on the border, and the Serbian authorities were very negatively reacted.
At an uncertain time, the road between the two control points, people flying from armed violence in the family, disappeared the palaces and settled on this place.
Nevertheless, inflictness has been insufficient.
When the police helicopter circled over them, the migrants cryed to "Clear the border" and cryed to the address of a special appointment.
Some protests refused food and water.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia announced the "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants from Hungary when they come from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be a part of the problem, not a coherent damage.
The next days we have to be negotiated with Brussels and other countries,” said in the Prague of the Ivy Darchich.
Volunteers on the Venice-Serba border started on the next day after the block of 28 countries could not develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to provide a general responsibility for 40,000 persons who were looking for refugees in the overlaped Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that in the future (in the next month or at the end of the year) will be reached a agreement that the European States would receive more than 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
The President of Germany, Angela Merckel and Austria, had needed to gather a extreme Summit of Europe at the next week to discuss an immigration crisis covering the continent.
Hungary, however, is not hoped that rapid action from Brussels or neighbouring is taken.
In Friday, the emergency situation in two southern regions gave the authorities more power to act on the crisis, which allowed them to switch the road and accelerate the cases of rescue.
At the time of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Venice Peter Siyarto stated that his country plans also to switch out of the border of Romania to move migrators through the country when it was completed by the Serbian border.
The Correspondent CBS News Charles Dagata reported that even prisoners had been connected to an urgent work to complete the seat of the shipment between England and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary became the main "looking place" and the point of transfer of the border of Europe for the population, many of which are refugees who are victims of war in Syria and the Middle East.
However, the Prime Minister of the country of Victor Orban insists that most people who arrive in the country are economic migrants who are looking for more well-being than refugees are victims of military action that have the right to protect, and that point of view is closely differed with the views of other EU countries, etc.
New laws entered into force in Hungary now are considered a crime of remission or damage of 4 meters (13 feet) shipping by the Government towards the southern border with Serbia, and are also more long terms of prison for the trafficking of people.
" The Venice Government announces an emergency situation due to the situation of the mass migration," said journalists of the Government of Seltan Kovach in the southern city of Segad.
We understand clearly: the illegal revision of the border is a crime.
Regularly, the parliament should still authorize the location of military forces that is expected for the next week, but the Associated Press reporters that are on the border have already been observed over a few days of the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs.
Dear Bacondi, the Adviser for National Security, reported about 45 persons who tried to move the border on the border, and still 15 persons within the country.
They have crossed the border, cutting the board, now under the police detention and accused of the judicial violations of new laws.
The authorities quickly restore the seat.
The Vienna authorities also closed two of the seven passengers on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, striking to block one of the passengers of the iron coat.
Orders were shocked through the main slope of the border around the city of Riosk (Hungary), as the cities were located in the serviceplace for the slope of people within the metal container, and the clusters gave each other to switch into.
There were about 20 people inside, and thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main vehicle from Serbia to Hungary and announced the refusal of food and water until they passed in Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's Excellency on Bernard Sanders has reduced two in the national survey
The former secretariat Hillary Clinton continues to keep the double advantage of democracy for the namement of the whole country, but Mr. Bernie Sanders approve it.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of the primary democratic electioners (lower 58 per cent) and Sanders is 27 per cent (over 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Bayden, who has not yet announced whether he would participate in the presidency, receives 15 per cent of the primary democratic electioners.
Over five months prior to the competitive election, most democratic elections say that they have been determined with the candidate to support.
Clinton's parties are more confident in their election, except supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey in the last month, Clinton lost support for some demographic groups, Sanders reached a number of cups.
Clinton maintains a great advantage between women and dead, but it has decreased.
Her support among men is significantly lost, and Sanders remains on paragraph 5 of it.
The proposal for Clinton's Democratic Electors for 50 years has disappeared, and they are now at the same level.
But Clinton still has a great advantage among the senior electors.
In the last month, Clinton has doubled Sanders to a double number of Liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
About half the primary democratic elections throughout the country say that they would support Clinton if it would be a candidate to this party.
Fourth would support her with some reservations, and 15 per cent would support her only because she was candidates.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
It may be unexpected that Clinton's current partners probably show more enthusiasm on her account.
Between those who do not support Clinton at this time, the views are more contrary - only some four with an enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of the primary democratic elections say that they would have supported Clinton with enthusiasm, less than the Republican electors say the same, Donald Tramp (35 per cent).
When Clinton's partners have an open question why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the need for experience (16 per cent), then that the current time of the Chairperson (13 per cent), and that it is the best candidate to this post (10 per cent).
Clinton's partners also speak of the association linked to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called agreement on issues and opportunities for election.
As Vice-President considers potential participation in elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic elections would like to be joined to the gang, although the third believes that it should not.
When they ask who they would like to see in the second place among the candidates of the party, the primary democratic electioners in most cases call Bayden.
Among Clinton's most half says they would have chosen Byden to the second, it's more than Sanders.
If Bayden decides not to put his candidate from the Democratic Party, the advantage of Hillary Clinton over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Byden from 30 points without it.
Fifty-five per cent of the democratic elections are seen in Clinton with the best chances of winning over the general elections, but the number has reduced from 78 per cent in the last month.
Byeden, with a large departure in the second place, increased the percentage of those who believe it as the most reliable candidate.
However, responding to the question that the most important thing in the candidate, democratic elections choose other options, except the opportunities to be elected.
Similarly in the last month, no candidate from democratic or potential candidates is an unacceptable nomination for these primary electors.
The candidates from democracy, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among the primary electors from their party.
Most believe that Clinton, Sanders and Bayden are honest and reliable to trust in people with good leadership.
Byeden of all three lies honestly, and Clinton's strong side in its leaderships.
30 per cent of the primary democratic electors do not consider Clinton a honest and rewarded trust, and more than those who say the same on Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent have no view of it.
The primary democratic elections are generally considered similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Bayden.
For all of these measures, some four democratic electioners have no view of Sanders.
Although the issue of the personal e-mail box and server at Hillar Clinton continues to be cut by the secretariat, most democratic electioners are satisfied with its explanation on this account and believe that this has not affected the general view of it.
But it's a very different story in the American public in general.
The half of the Americans today have not been satisfied with its explanation and only about a third.
The public's opinion was on this point in March, soon after the story became known.
Most Americans say that there was no impact on the general view of Clinton, although 36 per cent of them say that their opinion was worse.
The Republicans, more than six of each 10, claim that their views about Clinton have been worried.
Even though Clinton is considered the honest and reliable trust of electors from her party, it remains a problem for it among the registered electors in general: only 32 per cent of its honest and providing confidence, eight paragraphs below in comparison to the last month, and 15 compared to her mother.
Sixty-dose per cent of the electors registered does not consider its honest and rewarded trust.
At the same time, 55 registered electors throughout the country do not consider the Trumpa honest and reliable trust.
However, both Clinton and Tramp are good marks on leadership.
From the six protested candidates of Bayden, Carson and Bush showed the best results of honestity.
Most people see Sanders more honestly than not, but, like Carson, many have no view of it.
The error for the selection of 351 primary democratic elections is 6 per cent.
According to the national survey Ben Carson, Donald Trampo
Ben Carson was in charge to get to Donald Trampoo in the last CBS/New York Times survey
Two candidates made half of the votes of the electors in the new survey, left all other in search for opposites under the footsteps
The Republican electioners throughout the country continue to support Trampa massively, which has increased from 23 per cent of the recent CBS in Fox News discussion last month, to 27 per cent in the summary held in Tuesday.
But Carson fled the same period from 6 per cent to 23 per cent.
The survey also showed that Carson was supported in all demographic groups, confusioning Trampa in the Group of Republic electorals with higher education.
The original candidates, except Carly Fiorini and Ogayo John Kascha, have distant back with the Governor Viscals Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10 per cent in the last month to 2 per cent.
The former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Arkansas Mike Hakabi and Senator from Florida Marco Rubio are together with the third place of 6 per cent.
The request for the election of 376 representatives in this new investigation was 6 per cent, the investigation was held in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey last week showed the growth of Carson in the surveys, demonstrated 19 per cent of the Republicans, with 32 per cent of support.
The recent ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that Tramp was significantly infringed by Carson.
With regard to the growing support of Carson, the last week, Tramp had made a number of critical accidents to the former neurochirurg address, even when Carson regreted that the Trump's faith was doubtful.
"We need energy," said Tramp in the past Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iwave.
Four brothers are accused of the death of the first college Baruch
About two years later, after the death of a college, the brotherhood in the mountains of Popono in Pennsylvania was arrested against five persons.
"The members of the Pete Delta Psy from the New York College of Burch strictly attacked Chana "Mycla" Dana during the routine in September 2013 and did not put him in the hospital at a time, which was insepared by his death," reported to the police.
Official persons say that a student with inclined eyes and a 30-four-four century pigs had touched a few times since he tried to achieve the goal, a scope of surface.
Mr. Deng finally congratulated that he had a head and then fell without conscience.
The members of Pie Delta Psy did not call at 911 when Dengue lost conscience, and they waited for a time before he was taking it to the hospital, says to the police.
However, they found time to change the clothes of Dengue, find his symptoms in Gugla and contact with Andy Menng, the National President of Brothers, to ask the Council, as told at the press conference of Chris Wagner.
"At this time, brothers began to hide personal property, as they were, to make the well-being of the brothers above the health of Michael Denga, " said the head of Wagner.
He couldn't save, and he ended the next morning.
According to the coverage report, Dengue received a number of smells of heads, smells and poor.
“A lot of families suffered from brotherhood rituality, since at least one student dies during them every year, starting from 1970,” said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brothers and their members should be responsible, and this step from the authorities is very important.
The sentences of Monroe were sentenced for the murder of the third stage for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, have been accused of violence against news and crime.
"We want to be responsible for not only individual parties, but, if there was an organization that has authorized it officially or informally, it and it", said Vaganer at the Press Conference on Tuesday.
The College Baruch prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood was excluded from its structure of the local office.
What happens when the Federal Reserve increases the rates
The rate increased, and the "float market" is confronted, the income of the flows increases, and the economy has fallen in recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know, so how long it's going to be, and how long it's going to be.
It is essential for the economy to explain the time.
The recession started only 11 months after the first increase of the rate and totally 86 months.
The Federal Reserve Level of Taxes often, although not always, determines the reaction of economic and financial assets.
The United States Central Bank is therefore so slightly emphasized that investors should not be focused on the starting of taking taxes and how much the adaptation will be taken.
Indeed, the multitude of those changed.
At the end of the end, however, the market participants may find that the whole rates are overwhelming.
"A further increased rate of the Federal Reserve, with the invasion of global financial crisis, will be unevitably interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the EEA", reported Julian Jessop, the main specialist for the international economy in Capital Economics, in his comments for customers.
On the contrary, we are not expecting that the progressive return of percentage in the United States to more normal, but still lower levels will be a sexual impulse that many are threatened.
This does not mean, but it will not be the consequences.
This is how some economies could react in depending on historical trends:
As the market has already seen in the last months or around, the expectation of increased rates may lead to uncertainty at some time.
However, in the increase of rates, the consequences are generally not such dramatic.
"It seems to be income from actions for 12 to 24 months after the first squeeze, which may probably reflect the delay in monetary policy," said the German Bank analysis in recent research on the increased rate of the Federal Reserve.
In particular, the market is more slightly changed over the past 35 years - about 14 per cent of the rate increase, remains sufficiently rare for 250 days after that (mean growth of 2.6 per cent), then, at the expense of 500 days, the average income of 14.4 per cent of the last six cycles, according to the recent analysis of Bob Doll, the main trade policy specialists in New Asset Management, the public in Barrons.
German says that the results for valuable bumps do not tend to become more expressed at the stage of increased rates, and income from actions begins to reduce.
Recesions are the fact of economic life, but increased rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve has put into conditions that have not existed before and could accelerate the recession.
Mainly, the currency internal product will be almost in its lowest point for the existence of an increased rate.
According to the German Bank, 118 cases of increased rates since 1950 only two times of the nominal annual SBF was 4.5 per cent below.
Even in the second quarter of 2015, he was 3.6 per cent, but few believe that it is long, while only 1,5 per cent of the Atlanta Fed data.
The improvement of the rates to such an insufficient economic background may be risked and asks "does it differently", reported in Germany.
Market participants are prepared to increase the rate of the Federal Reserve System throughout the year, with their view to the meeting of the Federal Market Opening Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategic and economic experts believe that FOMC could accept increased rates at this meeting, the feast trade is only 25 per cent of the possibility.
"In our study since 1950, all the rates of increased rates have been in the supermarket increased in the financial market in GDP, which prevailed the recession, very fast after the reprise began," says the report.
In contrast, it was extremely slowly recovery after the worst recession of the election period.
The current cycle at this time is the longest of which the Federal Reserve System had expected from the end of the last recession; the recourse has been 35 months, the whole time of its 74 months and has not yet been completed.
The fixed income was also insufficient while the market expects to increase rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one which is implemented for actions.
The principle difference is that the effects of the effects are more rapid than for actions when the federal system changes strategic course.
In cases, the income seems to be changed immediately after the first increase/reduce of the cycle.
In the end of the cycle, the income rate is immediately falling", reports Germane.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that increased rates will lead to the accuracy of long-term and short-term revenue levels, making a more polar.
The high income gap is often better in this climate, although "we are still worried about income income", says Cathy Jones' research, the analysis of the fixed income in Schweab.
It is interested that Johns considers that the markets have already been adapted to the expected results of the federal policy system.
" In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations, the market has shown that a more wide monetary policy has been made", wrote it.
The percentage rates of short-term employees have been increased, while the income of more polar, the credit resets have increased, and the flexibility of all market features has increased when the federal system was renewed.
In general, the company that leads to its main business in the United States wins from increased rates, and the local product will become more attractive.
International companies have long been worse because the increased dollar makes their production more costly in the world market space, and their debt is more costly in financial.
The story shows that the "case" actions demonstrate the effectiveness of the market over three months after the initial increase of the rate", said the Goldman Sachs analysis in the report for customers.
The company with a stability financial status has due to an insufficient condition of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 in average 5 per cent of the rates.
The company with high income of the capital and low-government shares have also shown the best effectiveness than low quality shares in average 4 (per cent) and 3 (percentage paragraphs) respectively.
The duration will be a great question.
The company with a high percentage of swimming debts lose more, according to Goldman.
In addition to purchase contracts, the consumers will benefit from the growing dollar.
The income could also be seen by higher income, although the experts disappeared as soon as this happens.
"BBC Radio 3 - Classic FM copy", states Parliament's member of Andrew Bingham
Member of the parliament of Andrew Bingham has discovered the station for "Reducing standards"
It demonstrates that it is less different from the commercial competition
The BBC Music Awards also emphasized that the premium is just a brides.
The colleague on the parliament of Damien Collins, who was infringed to The Voice with the same criticism, was not originalized.
"BBC Radio 3 becomes classic FM", said the leaders of the parliament, encouraging telecommunication to prove that it does something that does not commercial company.
The member of the parliament from the Consertors Andrew Bingham also declared the BBC guide that it seems to be the public radio "Glupeet" and becomes less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 looks like I don't like to use the word "forgiving" but it seems to be classic FM," he said.
He also stressed the BBC Music Awards' premium in the last December.
BBC Music Awards, who's past year old, looks like The Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something else -- this is two examples that the first ones came to me in the mind, in which you actually just copy what is already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of BBC rejected the accusedness, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was far forward to his commercial partner when the case was related to live music and audio education.
What I know through Radio 3, I don't know anymore about classic music.
And his loyalty to the living statements and the creation of music is indeed not compared to anyone.
"I think it's really very important, and I think, the interest in Radio 3 in searching for a new music and promoting new events," he said.
The BBC Radio 3 Alan Dave said that radio stations had to work much more to take audience than in the past, because the Britishs were less classic musical education.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC, which had been attacked by the attacks of the competitive competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Cultural, Measures and Sport.
The member of the parliament by Thory Damien Collins attacked The Voice musical show that BBC purchased in the Dutch Talpa Media for the orientational price of 22 million feet of sterling.
See why this programme is often discussed in the absence of originality and different aspects?
Lord Holl states that BBC 1 show, in which Palm Feat and Boy George participated as judges, was made in the "typical BBC style".
He adds that the Corporation wants to be "wet in his home gate" next time she will start a developer project.
However, it does not consider that it is necessary to prevent the order of the new sessions of The Voice in the future or to use money those who pay the licensing collection for other forms.
The Internet sales rose was slower in August, and that may therefore be the Black Fifth
In the first three months of 2015, the increase of online sales to 7 per cent was observed
Last month, the late growth has been observed since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales have been actived three years ago by using mobile devices for shoping
Experts believe that the November Black Five could contribute to the detention of the costs
For about ten years, the vulcanic shoopen experiences a boom, transforming many central streets in Britain to a precautional city.
But experts say that there have been signs of online sales balance, after the last data showed only seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Overall online-shaped expenditures have shown minimum growth since they began to be fixed in 2000 and only 5 per cent increased.
Experts say that there have been signs of online sales balance, after the last data showed only seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at growth in the past years and return back to 2000 g, they have always found a reasonable explanation", said Guardian Andy Malkech, editor of the IMRG sale index.
He explained that online sales have been intensified three years ago when the buyers were using their mobile phones to purchase.
This means that more people had received the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do it in any condition, for example, sit on the watch.
But now it comes to the payment, and you can see the decline (on growth).
The Black Five, who came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for delaying sales.
Experts believe that the purchasers could stop the purchase of an event that happens on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, the purchasers spent five times more average to computers to be able to use profitable proposals by violating the same number of seller web sites.
Experts believe that the Black Five when purchasers are in the real fight for the purchase, they could put people away from the shooting
According to the study published by British Retail Consortium, more than 1 pound of sterlings are online.
With regard to goods such as television and natural machines, more than one third is sold through the Internet magic.
At the same time, more than four people purchase clothes and embraces online than in modern shops on central streets.
Muslims are horned by the murderers in Mexico, and Ben Laden's family sanctions
Muslims have the body of 29 dead in the streets, as the first entertainment in Mexico begins
At the same time, Saudi Arabia was born in part by the accident of Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that 394 individuals had also been traumated after the crime of the ground.
Hundreds of Muslims were shocked on the streets to enter 29 of the victims who died in the main sword of Mexico.
The mainly obtained in the white crowds, which were at the gateways, had a starting part to give respect to the first of the dead who had been sent to their last path to the Al-Moaissem board.
The special process passed in a sacred place where the building clan had tried the swords and slowed to the desire over a few days.
The body was issued to the funeral, and at the same time the king Saudiths slaughtered a building company belonging to the Ben Laden family, for the accident that also was arrested by 394.
The body 29 died when the crowd was violated in the Main Sword was carried out on the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children of Kasim Akram from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was in his first pallonic journey when he disrupted the clan.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Sword together with his parents before the start of the annual hage.
Sauditan authorities have already promised that Haj will continue, since thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said that Binladin Group should not leave the shooting of the shooting in the lack of work.
In the Arab version of a decree published by the Saudi Press State Agency, the Binladin Group states that it is partly guilty for a crime.
The British News Agency did not report this detail, but reported that the leaders of the company were prohibited to go outside the country.
Last week, Salman promised to explain the reason for the fall of the crowd in the Grand Sword, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were shocked to be sent to the Haj this month.
The Binladin Group has not made any statements on the abuse of the land, and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Kingdom Decree also condemned the company in non-use of modern security measures and inadequate agreements with the meteorological service.
Decades of pines are around the Main Lower of the Mexican Sword, within the extensive construction works conducted by the Binladin Group.
The family Ben Laden in the decades includes the nearest family of Saudi Arabia and leads to larger construction projects.
The dead leader of Al-Qaida Usama Ben Laden was a son of name whose family was rejected in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain has been only a few days before the Kingdom has arrived millions of people to participate in the paleration, which would be required for each employee.
The officials reported that 158 persons remained in the hospital.
Official persons decided to pay a million rivals (approximately 174,000 feet) to the parents of the dead, and the same amount was unreasonable.
The final victims will receive half of this amount.
Chapter B and Q states that the train is explained by the existence of Eastern European masters who work for small money
According to Veronica Larry, the British people are increasingly taking repair specialists
The number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe grows
The result is opening more than 200 new Screwfix shops for specialists
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q shops throughout the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, head of the city Correspondent Daily Mail
They say that the Britishs are put into the side of the milk and the malarian cups, instead of taking the qualified Eastern Europeans to carry out home work
If you can talk to a milk or a ball red the wall, it seems that you're in minority today.
Because, according to the B&Q owner company, the Britishists are increasingly taking master specialists to carry out an uncomfortable home work.
Veronica Lori, the new Director-General Kingfisher, who owns the home management network, reported that this train had a significant scope of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering minimum price services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 Screwfix shops specialized for masters and also close 60 B&Q shops.
Ms. Lari said that she would like to see more women in the composition of the B and Q shopping personnel, as eight of the 10 of the purchase decisions were taken by representatives of the weak field.
Today, most of the staff are men.
In its words, it is not possible to observe the last demographic trends that characterize the increase in the number of households with single women, more than in the past.
Ms. Lori said, "The man still works in our shops.
We need to take steps to achieve the balance.
In general, half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions for the purchased products are taken by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Lori is one of the five women in the UK leading companies whose actions are taken into account in the FTSE 100 index, and has also changed the composite of the drivers teams, accompanied by the directors of the equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher is not the only company that is about 50 per cent of women, including the general and financial director.
Ms. Lori said: "This was a conscious decision, the diversification is a important issue for us.
There was no complication to find suitable women in the Directors Board.
After the group was taken on the shopping costs, Kingfisher's company showed the reduction of arrival and sales in half a year.
As a result of the Kingfisher train, owner of Screwfix and B&Q, 200 new shops are opened
Time for decisions on the percentage rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The Peace observes the meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which is discussed within two days of the decision to take or without a percentage rate in the first decade.
Reuters' 80 economicists reported that more than half of those still considered that the Federal Reserve would now believe that it was still slowing and maintaining a rate of 0 to 0.25 per cent of the current diameter.
This is a historic event, because it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve has decreased the rate to zero.
The first time we approach that the main bank can be accompanied with the nucleus note and start the standardization of percentage rates," said Anhel Wilde, director of the International Economy Institute.
The United States economy works effectively, economically, adds trillions to the balance report and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision affects the world economy.
He warned the market that it should be prepared for changes, but all of them said their confidence is that all opportunities against such a step were possible.
The decision will be announced at 2000 CET on Tuesday.
New Balkan Street: Refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
A hundred refugees scan into the Horgosh control point on the Serbsk-Venger border.
From Tuesday, Budapesh has crossed the border for the residents.
Refugee searchers have already started to experience other route options in Europe.
One of them is through Romania in the closed border with Serbia.
The other is through Croatia and Slovenia in Austria.
A number of data shows that buses that have brought refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now sent to the city of Shida to the Croatian border.
The Völders received a discharge from the authorities to follow without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of Internal Affairs, Neboish Stepanovic, ensures that his country do everything to help refugees but is limited to its possibilities:
Our work is to ensure Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to make a huge relationship with them.
But it's already a common European problem.
It is unlikely, no country in Europe will do so alone, and a smaller country as Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Victor Orban is unprecedented:
If someone is called a refugee in Serbia, he must fill the necessary documents for that document.
And if he doesn't do this, he will not be in our country, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already established a 175-third strip on the border with Serbia.
But Orban is not intended to stop it: it plans to make the same remboursement on the border with Romania.
Buharret already stated that it was incompatible with European principles.
The Encyclopædia Britannica: "Europe wants to help us."
The angels of Meimarracis have been in the legal centre governments that, according to the left, have come to the financial crisis for a few years.
He now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, slows the calls of Cyprus.
In a few days before election, he met a journalist Euronus.
Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to the Eurours!
Evangelium: Thank you for the invitation.
12 months ago, your party suffered a devastating conspiration, engaged in the Syriza coalition, but now, on the question, the "new democracy" compared to her popularity.
What changed for that time?
The Gospels of Maymarcus: Greece has changed, and we too.
Mr. Cyprus was a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget and economic growth perspective.
Now, the country has a re-budgetary deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors went out because Mr. Cyprus's spent them.
In the last nine months, Greece was able to evaluate the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Cyprus.
And now they can easily compare the promised thing in reality.
The daily life was significantly worse compared to January when the situation was improved, with which the majority of Greek citizens were involved.
Eurowes: But you're saying that, in case of the winning of elections, you will try to join the other parties, including the SIRIZ.
The Gospels of Mexico: This is what Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation in recent years.
And it is not unexpected that in all other countries where the rescue programmes have been acted or still operated, political forces and all rule parties have gathered together to implement the programme to which they agreed without rejecting their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I believe that at the present stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions allows the country to go forward.
Eurowes: Your party was proclaimed in support of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the creditors of the country.
If you will be a new prize on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it at least?
In reality, we proclaimed Greece's movement on the European way, because we are well representing what culminant consequences would bring out of the EU country.
Europe is now helping us by providing support to our farmers for their production, we have solidarity funds, Yunker package and support in the bank sector.
All this would be lost if there was no treaty with Europe.
However, the current measures of the economy were the result of Mr. Cyprus's negotiations.
I know that Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government in the first year wants to rule, it works rationally and understood that the country has a strong political will for the implementation of the rescue programme, so I am sure that all the commitments adopted that cannot be fulfilled because of recession may become a subject of negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors because they are expected to completely implement agreements.
If we want to relocate their trust, we must continue to pursue, reform and structural changes agreed by continuing using the advantages of EU funding and large investment opportunities that we need to open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus did not submit any serious arguments on many key political issues that we have explained, discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give an example of farmers' revenues.
We have explained to our European partners that it is not about the fixed month income, and therefore it cannot be fully covered by taxes previously.
We said that the Ministers of Cyprus have never spoken about this.
The Greek Ministers were not prepared and not fully informed, and therefore they made negotiations and made an unsuccessful agreement.
Eurowes: If you win for elections, you will soon be on one table with Mr. Yunker, Olland, Mrs. Merckel and other European leaders.
Are you going to differentiate what you're telling to them, from what your predecessor Antonio Samuels told them?
Evangel Maymarcus: First of all, I explain to them that until the end of 2014, we have tried to comply with the 2012 agreement with the strict edges in it.
We moved forward to reforms.
Of course, we did not have the necessary determination and speed, but we have acted in emergency circumstances.
The line falls, and it was not apparent that potential purchasers were ready to pay the price of the Greek Government.
At that time, I was a spymer of Parliament, and I could agree to the opinions of the three parliamentary groups that were then the majority of the government.
In spite of their serious ideological differences on key legislative projects, we had a parliamentary, which is in the presence of popolists and extremists, as well as of massive manifestations outside.
We could be able to make the country a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process was not stopped by the preceding general elections made by the Presidential elections.
Euroweek: The last week on the territory of Greece moves the massive river of refugees.
What do you think of this situation, and of the reactions of European countries in which these people are trying?
The enemies of Meimarakis: Crisis with refugees is a slow-ended action bomb with which we should have a case after the winning of elections.
And the reason that the Syrian Government did not act in this situation as it was.
In such matters, it should be inclined, because if you face the problem, there are only emergency measures.
And now we're in this situation.
Even the temporary Government of the CYRZ has done over seven days more than Mr. Cyprus for seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the temporary Government, which provides valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, which calls for the EU Summit, will make a decision.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country and notify the unlawful immigrants.
The victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some emergency events that have occurred with them.
This issue has a deep humanitarian aspect, and we will keep the position that European policies must take in this new situation.
This decision should be taken in the EU itself, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need the best coordination of action, more effective cross-border control and refugee reception centres.
We must also use effectively the economic assistance received from the EU to be able to address this poor problem.
Eurourones: Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Evangelium: Thank you.

A man who disblocked the gun at the University of the Delta, left a note with excuses
After the shoot and murder of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning, and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a record in which he said "congratulates" about the first murder and wanted to "too back", reported the authorized bodies on Tuesday.
The police in the city of Gotia, Mississippi, reports that the employee of geographic and public science at the University of Delta has called at 911 a.m. to 10 o.m. to the service.
On Monday and told him he shot someone.
Lamb said to the manager that the police had to send people home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he recalls that there's a "pocket" in the house that "no one's throat," but it probably was disappointed.
The police was interested in calling, but he didn't call it.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the fire.
When the police arrived in crime, there was 41 years of death, and written by the Lamba's record, 45 years old, saying, "I'm sorry I would like to return everything.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
When the note recorded, Lamb passed 300 miles to the University of Delta, where Itana Schmidt killed, a historic employee, and on Monday night, when the police was surrounded, he ended with her.
The Director of the University of William LaForge reported that he was not known about any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "It was apparently aware of Mr. Lamba".
In spite of the Monday information that the Lamb pretends Romans between Princess and Schmidt, the official service at Tuesday reported "no information or evidence of a loved triangle".
Principes replied as a good man, Shawn O'Stin, who reported that she was married for about seven years.
They've been broken 15 years ago, but they've been friends.
O'Stin told him and Princess had a daughter of 19, and she was "assumable".
He added that Princess and her daughter were the best friends.
According to Lindsey Noux, the Sun Gerald newspaper called a close friend of Princess, last worked from home through the Internet.
Noulds told that Princess had a pleasant piece of Latining, and she met Lamba for about three years.
Nource said, "He always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called the parents at a moment on Monday to say that he wouldn't go in prison.
On the same evening, when the police shocked him on the shooting 1 away from Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, shooted out of it, fled to the forest and shooted there.
According to the summary made on the University Web, Lamb was received in the University of Delta's University of Pedagogic Science in the spring of 2015.
Stars losing their luck
Atter (left), on a photo with her son, Redmond, right, survived a few difficult years.
In 2001, he was fighting with lyquemia, and in 2009 he lost his multi-year life satellite Farra Fosetti, who died from cancer.
As reported, the actor also suffered from drug independence and arrested him in 2008.
All of this, of course, has played its role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester in a few months because of a double break
Luke Shaw cut the right leg in two places during the Champion Liga, in which the United States played PSV in Andhoven.
While the protector is concerned about this matter which is not able to go to the field for at least six months, Louis Van Gal hopes that Shaw can play again in that season.
The trauma occurred during the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw was shocked in the Strong Zone of the PSV.
He had helped the field within nine minutes and gave oxygen before he was taking to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double bar, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be moved to Manchester tomorrow or day later and then operate.
This was a terrible, young man who came to Manchester in 18 years of age, overwhelming great difficulties and playing fantasticly, and that happened here.
It was a oxygen mask in the cutting.
He cryed.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double bar, it's six months, and the guy can't play in the group.
I hope he can play again in this season.
Morno was glad he had no red card and was not appointed to the toolbar.
Arbitre Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a mexican.
Van Gall believes that the Italian court had made a mistake.
Judge yourself when I say that it's to be switch and red cards.
It was a very bad cock of two feet.
In your Twitter, Shaw writes: "Thank you all for your message, don't describe how devastated I have been, my way to rebuilt begins, I'm returning stronger than it was."
On the other hand, Manchester United is concerned with Luke Shaw when ISS played
The Protector will be further encouraged to move to Championato of Europe in France on June next.
Philip Cooke, a PSV trainer, said, "This is a very hard trauma."
When any player elects such a trauma, it's all very disappointed.
This was never the purpose of our players to trauma the opposite.
Morno moved his feet off when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under the Van Gail leadership in Championete Mira 2014.
"He's now very difficult because he didn't want to hurt the opposite, and when you hear that it's a very heavy trauma, you're feeling wrong," said Cooke.
I couldn't see the same moment.
The only thing I could see, it was a smoke that flyed in another direction, so that looked like he (Morone) was shocked, but I didn't see Luke's shoot.
In the conversation with SBS6 Morno said, "I know what this is, I know how hard it is to be overlooked.
I'm very hard, and I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado from PSV was also added to the hospital after Christ Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorex?
Each parent is quickly exciting one thing: if your child likes a book, it will take a little time before you get aware of it.
Let's see if you're not David Cameron.
In replying to the question of the representative of the group of children ' s disappearing company on his loved child book, the Prime Minister chose a reference to the environmental cycle written by Dr. Suzum in 1971.
This was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment published on the SuperCamps company, and continues to say: "This is a joyful, thrilling and unreasonable history with a strong message I love to read to your children, because it is always discovering some image or message that we miss."
And it would be good, except the last paragraph in which Cameron, as it is supposed, brings the content of the book, but it is actually a film that has been shocked in 2012 with new persons and details added to develop a very short original event.
"In the surrounded walls of the city of Alliance, where no green and even air was sold for money, the boy, named Ted, hopes to bring the heart of Audrey - the girls of their dreams to see the actual tree," we read in the text of the description of a lovely history known by Dr. Suzu (the real name of Teodor Susan Gazell), who died in 1991.
If this seems unexpectedly, Cameron's text is almost read as a short post of the "Lorox" film, published on the Internet Movie Database website: "In the high-empty walls of the city, where everything was artistic and even air sales for money, the boy named Ted hopes to get Odry's heart. "
It seems unreasonable that Cameron, with a general recognition of an active parent, is so unconscious of the content of a book named the boy knows how it destroys the environmental shocking of trees and the band of the Nacoming, despite the Protections of Loraks (who was issued in the name of the book) is a smuggling substance with the smell that speaks on the name of the trees."
It is likely that such an incomplete PR post was assigned to a executive who had never read a child book on Laraks 20 times.
The representative of Dunning Street said that the text was intended to be obtained from Cameroon's office in the election district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameroon's stage, but it did not follow further comments.
For Adam Lita, it was obvious that there was a risk not to get into the collected England, but it was still a complex issue.
The winning of Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is an unfair challenge, but if you look at the collection that England has chosen for this tour, the recurrence of the test series on the last time, I don't think it.
I wouldn't be excluding the victory in my field.
The Alistair Cook team may have been less experiencing than three years ago, but there are games that are vulnerable and collective thoughts; they will not be shocked since 2012, but only a young man's position.
With Monen Ali, it becomes a bowl with sweet meats, and Adile Rashid, even if he is unknown for the test level, is an attacking option.
On the other hand, Adam Lit was out of the assembly of England on the test cricket and replaced by Alex Hayes
The decision on the exception of Adam Lita to me, his main trainer at New Yorkshire, is difficult to analyze.
At its seven tests, there were two good attacks in complex conditions, but the evident but cruel reality is that the crystal games were evaluated by the judges.
There were no questions on John Ruth, for example, that the declaration had come to, because (and I have already said it) the games are best chosen to themselves.
A couple of fever, and Lita could wait for a more long carriage, but he was in his own court.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for New Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The main trainer of the assembly of England, Trevor Baillis, was well referred to his attitude, even when he didn't show what he could, and that's not surprised me; he's mostly the command game, and then the rest.
The question of how much time is to be before the band of the test cricket remains a complex issue.
Lit played in seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton had a chance to play in his and in the foreign field.
The only thing you could be grateful is that England has chosen Jonathan Treott for the Caribbean Prime Minister when Lit was in the best form, but this lost chance was already in the past.
It looks like Alex Hayes, and he's a bathsman I'm appreciated.
He's an unpredictable cricketist that we saw in the New York Club at the beginning of this season when he paid 236 masks against us in the Trent Bridge area, which was already something.
He must be provided at least the same time as those who were before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the OAE.
The museum put Mona close to Cook as an open band that would give the opportunity to introduce an additional snake, keeping four fast bottles, and I'm not going to do this.
I don't see why a shooting player can't shoot there, but this legend has already shown that he's a good cricket.
Monan may not be what he needs for his Wurstershire graph, but he became the third number for them, and there's no major difference here.
My old companion by Jastin Langer played his first 38 test machines by "third bathmen", before being opened in 2001.
He won three hundreds immediately and did not look.
Zaphar Annari comes in the collection as a reserve snake, and with my non-continuing society, he showed me a very promising young man.
People can look at his example statistics — a mid-third and 35-style- — and think that it is a risked rate, but among the switchs of voters, a little, and elected youth.
He's learning a lot in this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a pair of practical supplements in training.
The appointment of Mahera Jayawardin, the Sri Lanka Butsman, could be a master path.
He is one of the best guys for the game that brings the most richest experience in all possible conditions and any attacks.
Paul Colingwood is included in the games where the white meal is used, and is assured as energy as well as insufficient speed.
I always felt that he was born to be an international cricket, either a game or a training work, and, like Mahel, had a small intellect.
Sometimes new votes in the dispatch, even if they say what was already said, may bring new team forces.
Collega Colly on the Darem Ben Staux team left for one day, Ruth provides similar interruption in relation to Australia, and I, for example, do not experience this problem.
Although all of these are not agreed, trains and persons who choose players do not determine the schedule.
And you should remember how games are depending on the results.
Such decisions are never easy.
The Championship of Foreigners from Europe may be able to win if the economy is in depression until 2017
The unplanned police David Cameron for the renewing of British maintenance negotiations in the EU is still more complicated every day, even without the election of Jeremy's genetic "is it or not?" - the Corbine of the League League leader or TUC in Europe on Monday.
Foreigners also have their Corbine and Nigera Faragey.
The European Political diplomat explained on the day that, in the situation now in which the EU is now concerned with different crisiss, not all of them own production - some countries participating in the British Economy Agenda of Sustainable Dispenses and the subsequent changes that they mainly do not want.
After meeting in Briton at an annual meeting, TUC decided that he would not, in any case, want to destroy social protection.
We could even call this "Dave and George's Silf Program".
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are posted on the Samitas and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photos themselves on the background of the known local memorandum, in the company of local reputation or without it, and then come home and say that they join Unions to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be interested in maintaining external contacts under the tens of Eurowes, "Do not leave us together with France," says Berlin, proposes that the Ministers and officials in some cities be reached before understanding when they become the same, we stay or leave.
Angel Mercelle, a very careful officer in Germany, is an unity, but she is in the authority of 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation was worried for the persons who are sit in their place of Tatcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Cole (16).
Head of France France Oland is before the rechange or replacement in 2017.
He also loses strength.
Poland may soon receive the nationalist government of the right touch, Spain, the left.
It is likely to see their skin useful to help the "great-britannic" whose energy could be lost to prevent Skotlandia ' s exit - what they do not want, because most of them have similar separatory trends.
So some of these ministers may even plan for the extradition of snapless remedies in the SNP style during the Referendum campaign in Britain in 2017 to support the EU ' s exit process, my friend.
"Idea Fix" and "Britannia has not received anything of the value from the renewed negotiations."
The Europeans know what the Flight Street could be, and as skeptically the EU's media magnets have been established, unlike the time of Tony Benem's report in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 to 2.1.
They can smilely remember Boris Johnson, a shocked Europortunist who glorified their "direct bananas" by the EU, the Brussels Corporate at the beginning of the 1990s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a pest company from the fearing jelly taxes, phone hackers and non-resident pseudo-residents that have most of our big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same view, but gave himself a report that when you're in a cell with a boiled horse, you should give her the bananas to disappear it and not give her food to the channel and again with the tea.
In fact, Millibanando was the largest engaged by Biller, which was against Cameron's idea of referendum, since Biller had made the principles for the changing EU Constitution, the customized French and the Dutch electioners in 2005, which gave him a winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him.
But my lady Jeremy Corbin, who had a friend of me in Westminster on Monday, I told him that he had no longer time to lose him on me -- it seems to be a risk to repeat the "Boycot Mercoke" strategy from the 80s and then, and now.
This may take time, but he must develop a subsequent strategy for interaction with the press is not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marrom, whose guard was on Sunday.
The official position of the Corbine for Europe is that I am depending on evolution.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people in the border of Ukip's traditional trend and the larger circle of the "alarms of small English" could probably say "Yes".
This is the same as Hilli Benn, but not Bennett, and Benn said to the radio and TV this week, with its internal shocks, all of the forces refused to admit that the appointment of the Corbine of John McDonnel, the Minister of Finance, was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 70s when his elderman from all the TVs was struggling for the infidelity to the Labourist Bureau colleagues, not too far and not losing his post in the Ministers ' s chamber.
The Bethva Hilary was more appreciative.
But fighting to remain "in any circumstances" is Ben's phrase not what, said McDonell, and not what J. C. said to the parliament at a private meeting on Wednesday evening, in general.
If you want to report the democracy and the "speak" Corbine - remember, he even triggered me - the discipline of the messages remains important at the round TV for seven days a week, and especially in the waterway of social networks, paranoia and pregnancy.
This is wisely to let Cameron not simply separate from Europe, allowing him to take the support of library library during the referendum campaign, as McDonell said.
Simon Janes's sure is thinking like that.
But the main wrongdoing of McDonald and Corbine on membership in the EU, in the context of the "bennitic" economy, is no longer the issue of an ezoteric discussion among the left dissidents whose narcism that has been born in a low-specific number, is a central principle in dogmatical discussions.
With regard to his wrongdoing on Nato-Tom Watson, J.C. will not act on the outcome - foreign diplomas will be able to try to bring it to their leaders home.
Why is Paris or Berlin expenditure of political capital - they also have suspicious elections - when all of this can be unreasonable?
The United States have already been very disappointed by the weak military action of the United States in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the Government of the Trust has slowed expenditure that I have reminded at Monday forum in a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize electronic smoke review from Public Health England
Declarations by the Government of the Agency that electronic cigarettes were less harmful than smoking at 12 persons, some of who are related to the Taxi Industry, as reported by researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet have found evidence used by the Public Health Agency in their electronic cigarette report.
The PHE has published a significant report - the "return phenomenon" in the last month, called it "international review of evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the integrity of the data and indicated a number of experts with the taxi industry.
The last month, in the draft article of the Medical Journal Lancet, has been launched a "excellently sharp" based on the basis of which PHE has built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, more two researchers asked whether these statements were "supported or smooth foundations".
Martin McKi, the representative of the European Health School of London Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Caevelle, who provides clinical epidemiology at the University of Liberal University, reported: "The fundamental principle of health - the rules should be based on evidence of efficiency."
In their words, the public expects that the PHE declaration that "the best evaluation shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than smoking" were based on a detailed selection and modelling.
This is actually the only meeting of 12 persons to develop a multi-critical analysis model in order to promote their views of the damage related to different nicotinated products; the results of the meetings are briefly presented in the scientific publication.
MacKi and Kipwell reported that one of the meeting publishers was a company named EuroSwiss Health, the Director-General, who was reported that he had previously been financed from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also reaffirmed the BAT certificates in the health report on sustainable development.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced the financing of the e-smoking producer, not mentioned by the financing he had previously received from the tax company Philip Morris.
The wise explanation of the members of the Council was not provided, but there are among them a number of known electronic cigarettes, some of which also declared the financing of the industry in the publication.
It is unknown if there are other participants who have experiences of management in the Taxi.
The meeting also visited the manager of the Taxi Guide in the PHE.
The study article, published by the group, "speakly agreed" with the lack of "weapon evidence of the harmful impact of most of the products in most criteria", wrote McKi and Caepwell.
However, none of these links and limitations have been covered in the PHE report.
MacKi and Capevel told that the PHE statements "in the present time no evidence that electronic smokes are a road that brings children or non-smokers to smoke " were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fronton, Director of Health and welfare in the PHE, told that BMJ's statements had already been answered.
He said, "Electronic smokes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two smokers died because of their injury.
All evidence understood that the threats to health from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study remote consequences.
The PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what proves and what does not prove, especially where the publications had doubts about the relative danger in comparison with the taxi.
About 800,000 people die each year from smoking diseases, and smoking is 2 billion feet per year.
It is clear that, although electronic smokes are not safe, they are only part of the damage caused by smoking - we do our tasks before the nation.
The former chapter of the channel 4 believes that the BBC company should stop the EastEnders series
The former chapter of channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop the explanation of programs such as EastEnder and The Voice, noted that their business competition competitors would give a lot to the successful shows, as well as the "Albert's Programme".
Johnson noted that licence collections should be used only to establish programmes that were not issued by other British telecommunications.
He argued with the criticism of the BBC that the company is being transferred to public advertising, which must be viewed only a small part of the audit, at a short time when competitors walked with high-raying, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the Director-General of BBC Tony Holl said that the corporation would like to cooperate with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had tried to work in his six years without success in order to cooperate with BBC during the channel 4.
"I can't divide from the thought that BBC is ready to start and translating transfers that could show competitive companies without subsidies," said Johnson to the Committee on Communications of the Lord's Chambers, as a result of the explanation of the further BBC court.
If you keep the licence collection that I do not consider a good decision in a medium and long-term perspective, the company should leave in the eternal only those programs that are not issued and will not be issued by other companies.
Shoo The Voice comes in the editor, because the creators want to receive maximum support for the future.
The idea that nobody more shows it, is funny and clearly absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why recruitmental taxes should go to the financing of transfers that could be paid without subsidies.
The Voice is one of these examples, EastEnders, and it is generally known that they are their own production.
Other channels, of course, would have been given a lot for it.
I don't understand how this can be a public advertising.
I don't think it would be a BBC.
A series of Johnson company, launched by the Cannel channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC in shooting "for the ammunition of staff and because of their faith that it is the best way to prevent the duration of the duration".
His comments on BBC's most popular shows are called with the comments of the Executive Director Sky Toni Bolla, who proposed BBC to sell East Enders series in his study of MacTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003.
Johnson noted that the lower transmission of BBC public " continue to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audit, but the company's function is fulfilled, and that may be predicted as a argument for the Canadian preaching that justifys the income of the licensed collections at 4 billion feet: "No, of course, we do all these unreasonable transfers that no one looks."
They're putting them into the shooting where no one will never see them.
With regard to the licence collection, Johnson reported to the Committee: "I call for you to find a more registered system with regard to whom more will be obtained from it.
Of course, you're all thinking we all think that 150 feet per year is a great amount, but for people whose 150 feet are large money, they're interested, because they're not looking for and listening to BBC.
The former Executive Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elsten, who also spoke before the Committee on Monday, said that BBC should review the mission of Rita for information, education and development.
He noted that only a small part of the BBC material is formally classified as educational, it is 1 per cent of the television content and 0.1 per cent of the radio, and that the company should take up the initiative of Australian and Canadian publishing companies under the nine "Information, education and development".
Elsten's partnership noted that BBC should make more efforts in the fields such as the Premended Contracts (e.g., in his words, 'TV') and enter the Alliances with commercial advertising companies to make them available to the online review.
Sonogenetics allows to control the brain cells using sound waves
The video shows that nomates change the direction of movement at the time they affect sound impulses.
Scientists have generated a nerve with a genetically modified nervous system that can be managed using sound waves.
The raw nemates change the direction of the movement at the time they affect sound impulses, too high that human ear can hear them.
Impuls have effects by activating neurons genetically modified to use membranger channels that react on ultrasonal weathers.
Furthermore, researchers have controlled the brain through light
Scientists said that the skin showed the possibility of a new method called "sound genetics " which means the use of the ultrasons to recover certain brain cells, heart and muscles, and the source of ultrasony is outside the body.
Sricant Chassani, a Scientific staff at the Solca Institute, La Haya, California, told Guardian that this method could once be replaced by a deep stimulation of the brain, a invasive procedure in which human brain sends electrical impulses to Parkinson's disease.
Red-Natoids usually did not react to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they were starting to react when they were placed in a smoke with microscopic pushes.
He found that the powders increase the ultrasonic waves that then fall in the snake body.
The forced ultrasonal weather affects the structures called TRP-4 channels, found in the memorans of some corner cells.
The vultrascover waves put these yon channels to open and up-to-related cells are reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to create non-mathods that can be managed through the ultrasons, Chalasani made genetic changes to the raw, so that their motor neurons were using TRP-4 throne channels.
During the use of the ultrason for the impact of the modified organisms, the sound waves have increased microscopic pushers and have been introduced into the raw organisms by intensifying modified motor neurons.
This method seems to be used in "optogenetics" as a new direction to enable scientists to include and exclude neurons through light impulses.
Chalasani argued that, compared to this sonogenic method, there may be a number of advantages.
Unlike the light that is provided to the necessary part of the brain on the arsenal, the low-scale ultrashore flows unprecedentedly through the skin of the body, so it does not need to pass within the corner box.
" We believe that, in order to treat some non-viral diseases in clinical conditions, the use of genothertherapy and therapeutic virus can make human nerons feeling towards an ultrasound signal, " said Chassani.
He added that, moreover, the methodology could apply to muscle and insulin cells.

Advertising statements are issued on the British arms trade
See the role of Amnesty International with protest against the exhibition of weapons.
Awesome drones killers!
Destructive weights of iron candles!
Casey bombs!
Electrical light-shooting shoes that causes unexpected pain but don't leave the sequences!
The strict voice and availation of the pronouncement of the greatest international weapons exhibition of the Amnesty International was not doubted that this advertising has been a major international weapons exhibition - an episode of the Amnesty International to focus on the goal of the British Government ' s repressive weapons ' s weapons, using the EXCeL centre in the Docundase for defense technologies and security systems.

However, the special campaign has also resulted in an emergency exhibition of numerous bus stops and trains that are required to see them again.
"The important declaration from the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them by the London Metro fonts with a DLR line that converts to the dance.
In September this year, the trafficking traders struggle at the DLR line. The passagers are requested to help prevent weapons.
300 posts are described by artists who have made their work in the "True Design Moss" in the Bank's Desmaland Park.
The Collection, called the Group, helped to distribute them to London using the "Public Exploitator" of the 6-four host keys, which, as it is stated, "assums nearly the third advertising space on the planet's bus stopping."
London's transporters were deceived by such "vandalism" as an un-declared warrant.

According to Gavin Greendon, a smoker of Cruel Designs and providers at the University of Escoce, artists are more demanding and are trying to bring political art to the audition in the borders of the gallery.
Many artists start to work with protesting movements, understanding that they should be in real peace for their art if they want to influence society.

Amnesty's video was reviewed more than 1000,000 times per 24 hours on Facebook and has been created by the VCCP agency that works for bono with the graphic designer and sound artists that also work freely.
The creative director of the VCCP Matt Lever was inflicted by an advertising weapons exhibition - with a slow in the ExCel Calendar, and said: "We shall make them a campaign that they are trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and guitropistic corporate advertising, but "completing her home with light colors and animation was more enthusiasming."
"They were incredibly helping us to focus on the sale of illegal torture equipment on exhibition," says Tom Davis from Amnesty.
Now we need to ensure that the Government of the United Kingdom has taken measures and guaranteed that this torture equipment will not be legally sold directly to our war.
Maybe the most creative art of the arms exhibition comes from the ExCeL, where the participants are fantastically equipped.

Eight gold rules of residence in students
11 years ago, since I moved to the student as a normal 19-year-old man, still believed in beaches and morality, but now I remember the smile of those who I disappointed - and many long-term complaints on others.
On the basis of what I learned, I can put it on eight simple rules.
The normal movement may vary from the light of the nervous to the absolutely scary.
He encourages me to tell people where you're taking an academic department and where you're going to support Corbine and why you're "right, nor love, nor Marmith," because, seriously, it's just a red extract of Hahahaha, I'm gonna be on yourself."
Respirate.
And help others to smell, give questions and demonstrate interest.
This supports conversation and helps you find people you like, not those with whom you wouldn't even have spoken, even if you'd have a race, but they would have disappeared the fireholders.
Let's get people out of space.
People are often converted into sweet, medium-sized cinema and general swimming places, but they are also the place where people are sweet and controlled down white.
Another question: Don't even think to start learning at the university, in relationships
Introvertants in universities are unfair.
Your room must be refugees, but many communities form a styling culture from one room to another, which contributes to friendship, society and leads to debt friendship.
This may be a goddamn man who tries to restore the power.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "You like me, and I want to keep friends with you, but I need you to go, and I can restore the energy I've lost for communication with you."
Just try to feel when a competitor is cut into the society, not to shoot him, but to send SMS.
On the other hand, do this.
One man in my community followed this principle: if the door was not closed, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Take your friends with the smell.
As you start a university life at the shoot of Bake-Off, you're shooting into the doors to imagine and bring a shooting shooting shooting shooting, that's not so strange in the 1950s, it's not likely to remind them, "I'll be welcome, we're close to you, and I'm going to smile, and I'm going to give you personal questions."
Propose home rental is a good way to get married.
Your neighbors will feel that you should be sick and that your face may be associated with them with a nice surprise.
It's definitely depending on how good you're.
The smells of skin, swimming, and grain will make people smell when you smell them.
Food level is a typical crime in students.
You know, the shooting of some smokers is a shooting, but it's a smuggling thing to take yourself a little milk for the chea?
You're going to be the owner of the milk.
Maybe he'll suggest you not to smile, even if it's inside the wrath.
If someone smells your things, it's smelling, and I feel you, but try to get away from this adult than my neighbor who put in his milk sweats for the smell to detect those who took it without demand.
Now she's in prison.
You don't have to make a sound that will prevent people to sleep or learn.
It's not just to be a good man, but because you're the same people from the talking about shoot houses.
The girl in my core asked the neighbor to kill the blue and the bashitar sound, as it was three hours in the morning, and she's in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he was finally quiet at 5 o'clock, she was kindly allowed him to sleep two hours, and then shoot her music and closed the door to the three-time test.
Wasn't it romantic if your future mate lived in the same community as you?
Instead, it wouldn't be an emergency, even if you took a neighbor for your future mate, cut them into the relationship, and it should be seen every day, and maybe look at how he moves to your side all your common friends?
Of course, you don't get your heart - but if your neighbor is perfectly not your future mate, make it easy to cover your own skin.
When you understand that someone left the keys inside your slow room, a slight between the player and the grain more thicker than it seems.
It's fun, but it's turned into its contradiction in the seconds considered.
Precious and interesting security lesson, hide something, but never pack any of the dog patch and shampoon rooms.
Out of the foreign door and leave the keys in the stack of water that you'll then put in the shooting, but don't touch any other things with Blu-Tack to the slope more than two times.
iOS 9: as to set a new iPhone operational system after Apple update
The new operational system can be requested if you enter the Settings Application, select General, and then software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to scan it and install it.
Some were faced with problems after the installation when the error reported to them that the "newing of the application could not be able to".
To avoid this, users should be recommended or waited until the survival is stopped or try to update through iTunes.
The phone instructions will allow you to go all the process to the end.
The process may include the removal of appliances to increase the freedom of place, but Apple had minimised the possibility of this action, reduced the size of updates, and also facilitated implementation with a special notification that proposes to remove the applications and to re-establish them after the process end.
You should be sure that when you update your phone is loaded or is close to a loaded device to not allow your battery disconnection.
If the apple is too low, the update is stopped because the phone orders in the process may lead to a bad update.

Washington responded to the military activity of Russia's phone call.
The Secretary of the United States, John Kerry, called his Russian colleague Sergey Lawrence to discuss the situation in Syria.
He believes that the military support provided by the President of Asad only leads to the distraction of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House will not speak to the Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
The Secretary of the United States, John Kerry, called the Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Lawrew to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This reports the PJ Media publication.
" The Secretariat clearly understood that the further support of President Assad from Russia has a risk of distortion and proliferation of conflict, as well as negatively indicated on our general goal - fighting with extremism - if we also do not continue to concentrate on the search for the solution of Syrian conflict through the direct transmission of the authority", stated the representatives of the United States Department.
They also noted that Kerry had regularly emphasized the commitment to the United States to combat the “Islam State” in the framework of coalition from over 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of her.
Furthermore, the United States "we will join Russia's constructive role in trying to oppose the Islamic State".
The past Friday, the representatives of the White House said they did not exactly know what Russian armies do in Syria, but Washington would have to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, the secretary of the White House Josh Ernett noted that the time for a phone conversation between the President of the United States Barack Obama and the Russian leader of Wormburg Puttin was until it came: "When the President decided that the phone conversation with President Putin will go to our interests, then he will spend the pipe and try to make the call. "
Barak Obama itself believes that Russia’s decision to increase the support of the Asad ' s "producing rate".
I remember our conversation with Mr. Puttins four or five years ago when I told him that it was an error that the further support of Asad will only worse the situation.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and the situation was worse," said the President of the United States.
The aircraft shall be released from customs payments.
The mine development is intended to temporaryly release aircrafts and other swimming means to relax and sport from customs and tax payments.
The Ministry for RF Government ' s mandate was prepared for the changes in the list of loan goods.
This reported the Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Lashina.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister RF Dmitriy Meddev, on the results of travel in Clay, appointed a number of mining states in the Minnenium Development, the Ministry of RF, the Miniculture, MIT, IFS, FIB, the Russians to prepare proposals for the establishment of a favourable conditions for the coastal areas of the country.
Experts, on their part, noted that the main problem is the absence of infrastructure for safeguarding, services and ice content.
The authorities prefer to store their courts out of borders — €2,200 million per year in the complaint of European States for the maintenance, repair and services.
The Russian Mino Development Development has prepared the draft decision of the Council of the European Economic Commission on changes in the list of goods temporaryly carried out with full conditional release from customs payments, taxes, which provides full conditional release from customs payments, taxes for aircraft and other loans for dishes and sports.
The Ministry's view, of course, will help the establishment of favorable conditions for the development of iceberg in the coastal areas of the country, noted Lashina.
This issue was addressed to the subcommission on customs and non-arrithms regulation which protected measures in the external trade of the Government Committee on Economic Development and Integration held in September and was also approved by states.
As noted by the representative of the Middle Eastern Development, the measures proposed for full conditional release in the aircraft are, in fact, loose.
As a result, after the adoption of the protocol of the subcommission to the Government of the Russian Federation, the European Economic Commission will make a proposal to discuss with the EEA Member States, explained Lakinah.
The list of imported products that are fully released from customs payments, taxes include goods required to facilitate external economic activities and international cooperation, to apply in science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, to provide international assistance, and to them, the service equipment (personal computers, machinery), control and medium-sized devices, burning equipment, spectacular costics and decorations, moved laboratory and master, water, motor vehicles, machines, machines, newspapers, newspapers, newspapers, and musical materials.
In the press office of the Ministers RF, Izwigs said that they had prepared compulsory arrangements on marine ports Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yeltas, Feodozos and Evoporation, which provides a simplified order for swift and output of small-meer, sportive and passenger courts in the sea port.
The mining is given to the Captains of the sea ports of Crema to ensure the simplified scope of small, sportive and passenger courts in the sea port and the outcome of the seas-sized courts from the sea port.
The Minister has also prepared projects of RF Governments on the approval of the borders of the Cruma sea ports.
With regard to Yelt and the Federation, the rest of agreements have already been adopted, noted in the press of the State.
The view of the Ministers, oversight, classification and observation, the hospitalization of small-scale courts used in non-commercial purposes must be implemented by the Republic of Croatia and Sevastipolar.
The problem is that Russia has been extremely difficult with eggling because of the weakly developed infrastructure.
If we look at the south of Italy and France, it is a constant development industry in which a large number of people is involved.
In Russia, it's actually all the places.
Our neighborhood is the Black Sea in Sochi, Helengica, New Russia, Anna, the only piece where we can exploit ships.
But the great complexity is that the border service rules are extremely strict in this area: in order to walk on the edge, the masses of permissions must be formed.
Moreover, in Russia you're even going to be able to make it anywhere.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then he gets a problem where he's going to take, says the director of Sales of Northmarine Dennis News.
With regard to the location of icehouses, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special angels for ships up to 30 hours, and the horses are also sent to guard in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
The newspapers noted that the buyers of ice is rich, but at the beginning, the ship demand was low.
The World Bank has paid Ukrainian credit for $500 million.
The World Bank adopted a new project for Ukraine for $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This reported the press service of the international organization.
" The new financing supports a number of priorities for reform in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," says the report.
The Director of the World Bank on Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine stated that the reforms of the banking sector would help to restore credits in real economy and to encourage the restoration of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken the impressioning steps for economic reform and the World Bank observed the first sign of stabilization.
However, because of the serious problems of Phane, the Government of Ukraine calls for rapid reform.
Previously, the Polish Government has approved the allocation of $100 million of Ukrainian credits, transfers "New News".
In prisons are requested to create separate blocks for transgenders.
The General Council for the Implementation of Criminal Sanctions (FSI) on the Protection of the Rights condemned in October 2015, including other issues, discusses the establishment of individual blocks for transgenders and transferers.
In this regard, the members of the Board of Vladimidala Grib told them.
It believes that, in depending on the general number of convicted in Russia, the individual cameras, blocks or even (if such crimes are much) may be able to establish a special colony for trans-sexuals.
However, Vladimir Grib stressed that to determine the punishment of citizens in such isolated places only after the convicted expertise will be carried out, which would prove that a criminal is a person who is a person who is a representative of the anti-pollution field.
He has made sure that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the security of restraint punishment.
In his words, the proposed practice has successfully worked: the AIDS (in which the accused persons are before the court decision), individual cameras for transgenders and the corrective institutions are special blocks.
This is the only way to work with such criminals today.
Similarly, they must be excluded, since the presence of transferers and transgenders in the ordinary cameras is dangerous for them, the suffering of their families and the marine problems for FIN staff.
The decrease of transmissions from the cocamerists is guaranteed, said Vladimida Grib.
Depending on the number of criminals with an indefinite field, there is a need to consider where to distribute them.
SIZO is not specifically necessary - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yeah, a single column is possible if transgenders are much.
According to the fact that the block may be 50 or 100 persons, and if the specialized corporation is set up in Russia one, the punishment of the prisoner transsectors will be possible from any regions.
The citizens are in the AIDS on the place of crimes, so the income of transfers or transgenders from other actors during the investigation and judicial process is unreal, and this is the case to introduce such practices for the already convicted in a single colony, yes, it is considered by the Group.
Remember, the law enforcement officials were not able to decide on the case of a police isolator, a man or woman, to determine the detention detained for the 24-year-old drug transsexual Dmitri Coyukah (known under the name of Alin Davis), because a man with a girl's foreign arrest was not arrested.
He was out of his home under the sign of the shipping.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and media, as the transgender content mechanism in the AIDS and the columns in Russia was really not possible.
The Russian Ombudsman, LGBT Activists (LGBT - Lesbians, gee, bisexuals, transsectors) Nicolai Alexev supported the idea of establishing special places for the punishment of transgenders, noted that, in the displacement, people could also be defined in the colonies of husband or women, depending on their own desire.
In view of the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is right.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, as well as the security question for homosexuals, says Alexandre.
The prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be done on behalf of this and for homosexuals, so that they are more in prisons than transgenders.
In that regard, Alexandre is doubtful that Russia has been a number of citizens who are willing to take themselves to transceptuals because they are different from the ordinary colonies.
Of course, you can introduce medical expertise before placed people in the colony for transgenders, but it is not always the same.
For instance, one of the prisoners in the United States looked like a man, and already said in prison that he wanted to change the gender, said Alexandre.
A man may feel like anyone.
But as far as certain places for transgenders are left, I doubt that prison officials will think about the security of such people and avoid their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, the international experts on reproductive health in the territory of the RF Boris Lordkipanye pointed out that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsectoral crimes in the colony could delay the start of the punishment of the convict.
The Commission is a sex, a psychiatrist conducts long-guarding issue, is not one test based on a high-specific conclusion.
Today, psychiatric opportunities are enabled.
Therefore, before a different range, potential patients always have such expertises - they clearly show that the change of the field with a surgical interaction is necessary - says Lordkipanidee.
However, I'm hard to imagine how this system is to be introduced in relation to the convicted, because the average of this survey is a month.
The doctor, despite the general idea of establishing individual transsexual blocks, also doubts that, in the current economic conditions, it would be appropriate to provide resources to build new places, medical experts, transgenders in Russia.
No official statistics have been complex, but if we consider that Russia's homosexuality is about 5 per cent, it can be said that transgenders are still less than and those who have such a rejection and even commit a crime are incredibly low, said Lordki Panidz.
Now, as a request for the administration of the Homosexuality column, transgenders, and this can be obtained in individual conditions.
Mikhail Antiopus wins the Younger World Championship on Shakmat.
The Championship of the Peace on Shahmats has been completed in Huntza-Mansik for 20 years of university.
The first end of the convent has been more than an enthusiasm.
The winner was just determined in the last tour, and the Russians Mihael Antiows became a russian who shocked the Yan-Khishotof Dudu pool, who would certainly go to the title.
At the winning, the Ukrainian shakmatist Natali Bux celebrated.
The Championship of the Peace on Shamats since the beginning of September in Hantas-Mansisky, which was already at the middle of the tourist distance, seemed to have perished nearly all the deterioration, because the representative of the Polish Yan-Kshishetof Dud, who had issued a series of four wins (13 Switzerland systems), was certainly able to accommodate the leadership.
Bearing in mind that Dud was the first rating of the Favorite, it was considered one of the most promising young shakmatists, the probability that he would leave the resulting break was very slightly represented.
And even when Dud was able to defeat and let Russians Mihail Antipow to reduce the displacement of 0.5 balls, he remained obvious in the fight against the title.
The Antipoulos had to win in the 13th tour immediately.
But it wouldn't even help you win Dud to your party.
On the other hand, this obligation of victory could, of course, be said to the game of the Russian shamachist and bringing to uncompensed errors.
Happily, Michael Antioch was able to avoid them.
He certainly met Francois Rambaldi, after he was deemed to wait when his party was completed by Dud, who met Benji Bok.
Happily, the Poland shakmatist had confronted the Hollands with the slaughter.
Thus, Antioch and Duda provided the same number of points - by 10 of 13 possible, but Antico had the best additional indicators.
That is why he is the leader of the Hanta-Mansian autonomy district, whose Governor Nathania Comaru, traditionally focused on the development of shamat in the region.
And there is no enduring end in the slaughter of the girl.
The leader of the Tourism Nationale Buxe (Ukrainian) was not enough to lose the title in the last tour that she had succeeded and done.
So the winning of the Russians, Alina, the Bible, did not let her go to Bux.
The Russian sport has remained the second with the disappearance of the champion at 0.5 ball.
It changes the regional structure.
The company joins the Prevention and Ural regions in a counterparty of the Force and Ural region, Siberia and the Dark East in the East.
The draft will be completed until 1 November.
As he noted the genitor Mihail Slobodyn, changes are made to "stand a strong market player" to develop a company in new, not always interested external conditions.
In the television channel, Mr. Slobodyn stated that they intended to reduce a decade of staff in Russia.

The Igreet of Artemis, the FASS leader, said that the State against the indexation of 10 per cent of the tariffs for shipping and providing guests, as requested by OAS RJD.
At first, they wanted 17 per cent of the index, now they want 10 per cent, and even multimillional subsidies from the budget, said he.
We say, it's too much, it's too much, it's too much, it's going to be less costs, learn to economize, refusing from the precious specialities, football teams, your own TV, stop costs on the left and right.
He added that the FAO had its "wise more strict" proposals that are now discussed in the Government.
Polymetal considers the possibility of non-related calculation with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of implementing a total of $300 million, reported to the gold-contracting company.
In that case, Polymetal must be paid to $80 million (the difference between the cost of the Sumeru shares and the market kitchen) which may be taken from the free money flow.
Sumeru has time to 3 October to make options or needs of payment.
The details of the negotiations in Polimetal are not opened.
The option was concluded in the purchase of the "Kuzil" Project in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stashin, director of the Department of Housing Policy, reported that the Ministry, together with the CIA, would develop the sanctions orders.

In the current year, the Russian Administrator Association's Trup-1000 Russian Managers' research was 16 times.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian high-ethon managers, the study undertakes the work of Russian Administrators each year by identifying leaders in areas and functional directions.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the last year's ratings.
The winners of the past year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year and to issue members of their management team.
Furthermore, each of the initial candidates in the initial list propose to deliver to ten new managers from other companies, which would like to be added to the general pool of candidates.
Perhaps the movement of the following functional leaders: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, staff director, ICT Director, Director for Public and Corporative Relations, Director for Relationship with Authorities, Director of Corporate Management.
Each proposed expert is sent to the manager ' s invitation to participate in the rating and is enabled to issue its management team and to ten new leaders from other companies.
The application of candidates on a sectoral basis is carried out by the Association Management Classator: information technologies, trade banks, forest and forest manufacturing industry, machinery, medium-sized, metallurgias, multi-profile coal, professional services, communication and telecommunication, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel composite.

The company names are given in accordance with the Russian rules and the rules of "t".
At the time of publication, the rating can change the status of managers and companies.
Comfort rate for investment is 10-13 per cent.
As a result of experts, the small and medium-sized business credit market in January-April this year was 40 per cent.
What are your estimates the situation today?
After the panic events of the end of 2014, the amount of credit was significantly decreased in 2015.
It is understanding: slightly increased rates.
The estimation of 25-30 per cent of the year was not benefited by anyone.
If previously the bank could impose all its possible problems, from the time to the transfer, it is not possible to do so: taxes and so income.
For the business, the current IFB credit rates are incompatible.
For a significant part of the investment projects, the current level is inacceptable to their purchaseability.
Tax level 10-13% would allow business to invest in a wide project spectrum and to form an appreciative income.
How does your estimates satisfy the request for enterprises for credit?
After the CB reduction, the situation was a little improved.
Main resources were more accessible.
However, our observations showed that the customers have been insured by the credits of a lot of speech.
First, businesses do not understand the prospects of their development and future income.
Today, the business is one outcome: we need to learn to work through the current economic situation in the country and in the region.
We need to monitor the current results and monitor the movement of money.
At the same time, new technologies should be used to modernize equipment, reduce production and energy security costs.
All of this, eventually, allows the company to make the production more competitive and to maintain business even in an instable economic situation.
What main trends will IMS credit market strengthen and will affect its development until the end of 2015?
Is the rate of percentage changed?
Medium-sized rate projects will depend on the Central Bank policies, and the regulator now demonstrates that key rates are reduced.
However, the radiological decline of credit prices for ICB should not be expected.
The current situation of the problem is, first of all, an inflation that makes the necessary increased rate for real income.
Furthermore, the cost of money in Russia remains high even when the CIA rates are reduced.
In the case of the duration level, the traditionally small and medium-sized enterprises that are limited to the extent of money, as well as the adjustment of the economic behavior, will certainly represent a larger risk for creditors.
I wouldn't have been waiting for a significant reduction in the share of bad credits.
The main reason is the international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy of the country.
New Mazda C-5 and a perfect mode.
That is the word of Mazda by the Japanese jerome.
Red, laconic, and simultaneously very complex for those who are close to the cylilin or the latin.
Like the new C-5 crystal, as well as any other brand model: without ambitiousness lifted out, technically done inside.
The Japanese simply, in force of its "apopulation", can be able to make the bonds of the Star of the sun to the state of full relief.
You can make arguments for the use of cars from other countries, and a person even agrees with these arguments, but the whole conversation is disappeared from the final expression: "But this is a Japanese car!
You're not talking about anything!
Such people probably should love not only the technician, but also all other Japanese.
To quote from Bases, to administer youaby's food, to collect the catalons and to get your friends - no, no, no, of course, but on the canon of the Japanese modern mode: nice, creative and very unexpected.
I am glad that the Japanese school form is the only form of which girls are pleased and after the school ended.
It has wonderful properties: at the same time, feeling, and strict.
And as older girls, it's short.
The main change in the external N-5 is the decision of the radiator with five horizontal lines.
But there is a stronger changing of a new fabric and the back of the front, where the car is currently recognised in the stream.
As previously, Mazda C-5 looks very conciliable.
The power is harmonized, the forms of feelings, but the externalness has a stress flow.
I don't have to call the police.
According to Rule N-5, one of the world's most secure ones, only a slightly Japanese peace can be experienced.
The dial engine of 2.2 l provides a high-speed moment in a wide speed range.
The fuel expenditure of this engine is composed of a power slightly automatic transmission and a full machine.
Black bottles, black sweet, black sweet...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose ligers with a police legend of No Cross.
In addition, Mazda has made maximum efforts to not be found on the C-5 Rule.
In order to increase the competitiveness, the maintenance of this excellent management has been reconstrued in front and behind amortizors, and the form of the corners of the front markets was also optimized.
The full system is adapted under Russian conditions.
The speed level of road and high speed driving is decreased by 13 per cent.
The cobaltor in the flowers or in the pool is the same as the budget sedan.
Another case if a girl comes in a purchase with an original picture.
For example, from a computer game in a shooting shooter.
Attention to her then is not less than the new C-5!
The new C-5 building improved both the front and the back seats, which provides the optimal reserve of space and for wide stages, and for long feet.
Another long-term estimate that the front of the central ton is now milk and not shocked by ships in expressions.
Mazda's most wide range of active security systems is proposed just at N-5.
In order to identify potential threats, there are radars, laser and cameras.
There is an adaptive lighting here, and the warning of the east from the ground, and monitoring the dead zones, and safe movement.
Mazda C-5 is one of the best baggages in the class.
The load of a minimum expenditure is loaded by 561 l. The seats are proportional to 4:2:4, each section has an individual output market, and increases the bath sequence up to 1560 m.
The coast of the multifilm in Japan is called "cigurums".
It looks particularly sweet cygurums.
We can do it!
Of course I'm sleeping.
But it is still to develop small children.
Or simply shoot such a beast on the street...
This is so nice when there is a opportunity to choose — a pleasant clothes, a manner of conduct or a car.
Thanks for the preparation of the Kawaicat shopping.
Kiev has disappointed the atomic opinion.
Kiev officially refused Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the construction of the EFSA.

After turning to Kiev in February 2014 and the follow-up to two Kiev countries, the relationship with Moscow in the atomic sector began to be engaged, announcing that it was refused to cooperate in Hmernico EEA and on the project of construction in Ukraine.
The single area in which the relationship remained, the carburant was purchased in the Ukrainian active ECA (of half of the energy processing in the country), as the Ukrainian NEC was replaced by the Russian energy supply.

The FedEx issue has a delicate nature, decreasing prognosis for 2016.
FedEx was noted on the outcome of the last quarter, and the guiant of the service has reduced the annual arrival due to the fall of demand on road transport services and the growth of costs in its land transport unit.
The company also stated that it was planning to take about 55.000 seasonal workers at the festivals.
At the same time, in the past year, FedEx reported that there would be 500,000 temporary workers at the feast.
The share of its shares was about 2.5 per cent of the pre-released sales in 45 minutes before the opening of the shops in the middle.
FedEx Corp stated that it was planned to pay $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year, which ended in the next May, that 20 percent less than previous prediction.
The analysis suggested $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
In spite of the average rates of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and the increase in land transportation of heavy or garbatory goods starting in November.
The company said that it was still planned to increase expenditure in comparison with the last year by reducing expenditure, increased monetary income and online trade growth.

In the most expected for a few years, the federal reserve systems will take two days this week for a 27-four feet table from the Gondora red tree, decided whether the key percentage rate is nearly 10 years old.
At one time, a rich shooting room for meetings at two stages will depend on the tendency of the United States.
The map is reminded that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System Janet L. Ellen and its colleagues should bring the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank has received a double order from the Congress: to increase employment in the United States and to maintain the stability prices here.
But since the Great Recesion, the federal system leaders recognized that there was a third non-registered mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate may be an unknown factor in a almost sponsorized decision announced in the fourth century, whether the United States economy has been ready to take place from an unprecedented stimulation provided by almost zero short-term rate rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data show a reliable growth in the economy, recent stress on world financial markets can maintain and so careful leaders of the Federal System from adding valuability by raising the federal fund base rates - even only four per cent.
"Certainly, the labour market and inflation will become the first and most important object of consideration", said Lindsy M. Peeggs, the main economicist of the Broker Company Stiff Nicolaus & Co.
"I think that if they're looking for a reason not to take up the rates that increased indetermination around the world market enough to justify them to wait forward," she noted.
There is no consensus on what they do in the Federal Reserve System, which itself produces the financial market collection.
About half of the economists, recently revised Bloomberg, predicted the increase in the percentage rate for this week.
However, the financial markets are expected that the federal system will be maintained, while the key indicator only shows the likelihood of a speed of 30 per cent.
This may lead to the market of actions if the federal system is raising rates, provided that those who make decisions do not strike the promise that the next increase will soon be increased.
On Monday, the Dou-Jons index was at 228.89 paragraphs, or 1.4 per cent, to 16.599.85.
The flight was prompted by expectations that the persons defined by the Federal System's Strategy would leave a rate this week - said John Lonceki, the main economic group of Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It will be surprised if the federal system increases the rates at this time," he noted.
If the Federal Reserve System is doing so, "we must go far in the adoption of their strategy to keep the financial markets in their hands so that they are not packed".
Other experts expressed that the increased rates could be towards the financial markets, as this would take incertitude to how the Federal System would operate.
Over the month ago the Federal System seems to have tried to spend 0.25 per cent in this month, making the first small switch in slowly reliance of financial conditions, which could be reaffirmed that the United States was permanent.
Ellen declared early and early summer that she expected to increase the rate in this year, despite the complaints from the Liberals that the economic progress is needed.
Although new workplaces were delayed in August, the labour market growth was stable in this year.
The unemployment has reduced up to 5,1 per cent in the last month, which is the lowest indicator for over seven years, and almost at the level of the Federal System considered full employment.
The rate of payment shows speed signs.
While inflation continued to be lowered by the annual central bank of 2 per cent, the Federal System stated that the key cause was the temporary effect of oil prices.
The economy "is able to achieve higher rates and needs, taking into account the reduction in the labour market", noted Ian Sheferdson, the main economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world have become strike at the end of the last month, after China has paid their currency.
The average Dou-Jons-Index for Industrial Accounts slowed to a total of 16 per cent in May with high importance, as investors feared that the delay of Chinese economy could slow the world growth.
The dimension of its positions in this month, and the Dou-Jons index is now at about 10 per cent below the maïs higher value.
In order to guide the Federal Reserve System, the market recovery is incredibly complicated by the unfair calculations of the rate of increased rate.
"In the absence of the fact that the financial markets and the news on the weakness of China's economy would have been to shut up in the meeting, " said Steven D. Oliner, senior researcher of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official of the Federal Reserve System.
Now, according to him, they will expect at least a month to obtain more impact control.
"Indefinitely, the consequences of the American economy can be made, and they have almost no reliable data after the last events in China," said Oliver.
The health of the world economy does not include the main concerns of the federal system, and its techniques should not be taken into account when they are taken.
However, the Federal Reserve System became a world financial authority.
The impact of the Central Bank in recent years was great.
Only one mood from the then President of Ben S. Bernak in 2013 was that the Federal Reserve System could "speak" its money expansion, calling the markets over the world.
In the world where markets and economic systems are increasingly overcome, it could be expected that federal reserve system leaders will not only follow the development of events around the world but also consult with other Central Banks and experts to understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is "speaking art than science", noted Zakari Karabel, director of Investnet Inc, a company employed by global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted in this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve System, there were excessive reactions to the financial market movement, which seemed to be not related to economic principles".
Laker, who has the right to vote by the Federal Committee on the Open Market Chamber, was an example of decisions 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia led to the fact that the federal system reduced its base rate by 0.75 per cent for three meetings, "inviting the limited identification impacts for growth in the United States," said Laker.
Years later, the federal system has deleted these reductions.
The Federal Reserve System should set the first place for the stability only during large crisis, such as the market in 2008,” said Adam S. Pozeen, former member of the Bank of England Tax.
The last panic and nearly did not approach this level, he said.
"You wouldn't, of course, want to be in the situation when you fear the growth of the rates because the markets are worried," said Pozeen, President of the World Economy Institute, Peterson.
The Federal Reserve System Act continues to have a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and I do not think that the events should be overlooked.

The hospital of Sergey Narşistan allows the United States to destabilize the situation in the Middle East so that refugees are crying in Europe.

The Government ' s military and their loyally armed forms opposed murders, mainly from Islamics.
Afterwards, the Syrian Government has joined a terrorist group of the Islamic State forbidden in Russia.
The United States supports the rebellious and anti-Assad, and IH.
The official Damascus believes that such terrorists are terrorists.
The President of Syria called the cause of the unconsciousness of the West to Russia.
The claims of West to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
This opinion made by the Syrian President Bashar Assad in the RT interview, the First channel, “Russia 24, NTV, Russia today”, TASS, “Interfax” and “Russian newspaper”.
According to Asad, western does not adopt partners and sovereign States.

The Champion of Peace on a easy atletic Sergey Suvenko.
This season can be called a triumphal for a 24-year-old swimming aircraft from Barnaole Sergey SUBENKOWA.
He was able to spend on his coronal distance of 110 meters with barriers to win in Europe's command, to set several records, and to become a champion of peace, which was first in the history of a dividend barrier.
In addition, recently, the Sporter won the final stage of the Brazilian Liga, which was the third part of the Common Trade.
New Publications requested Swedish to share the impressions from the coming season.
Sergey, isn't the season for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to go to World Military Games, which will go October to Core, and then I'm going to think about relaxation.
True, I'm ready to go home now, in Barnaille, and being home, it's a very different condition.
It's easier than every week to move to peace.
You've told you that the bathroom's a lovely year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a great time.
After the primary season, the load of responsibilities will not be given.
You can be joyful, "slowly".
You know, and let me go...
Is there a slowness?
All the seasons are special, positive emotions...
The strength to the end of the season is always shocking.
And here's no importance of what he did more is winning or playing.
Each strike is stress.
The permanent ships, the transfers are not all that takes for the body.
You're physically and emotive.
But now, of course, I've got emotions.
I'm just happy.
At the time they finished the world champion in Peking, you're often back?
Yeah.
Yeah, you, journalists, don't give me this to me.
But in fact, I think that the wicked one who lives in old winners is inflicting his successful fleet again and again.
It was glad to win a couple of days, and it's got to move forward.
The preparation for this wonderful season was very different from the adjacent?
I can't say that something was such a particular thing.
We were ready to start in December, but the winter season I missed.
It was trained first in Barnaille, then at the congregation, and then again home.
Everything's normal.
But with the trainer, I was able to try to go to a new level at which I wasn't yet.
Practically, the winter was experiencing to put the base.
They escaped a number of crews, trained for the general physical training, including the burden, and the meetings, and we hidden the shoe.
Then we took the barrier training, and many have been employed.
How are the fighters talking, follow?
I'm always trying to do this, well in the Internet's era, there's no problem.
We looked at the winter champion of Europe, and in the bar, all the shooting shoots took the Frenchs!
I thought more: I need to do something to clean this company.
With each old age in this season, you've swepted and swepted in results.
Does that bring confidence?
I have all the last seasons that are about the same scheme.
Not that I run first 13,20, and then 13,50.
I'm always slowly cutting my shape.
The main thing you wanted to do is get away from 13 seconds.
All the work was mainly addressed to that result.
But paradox is that you feel that you're ready to shoot, and the snacks are not always prepared.
How was that, for example, at the Olympice in London?
I, if honestly, tried to forget it immediately.
It was very good, really it could get away from 13 seconds.
Even if you repeated your best result at that time, it would be a blonde game device.
But it wasn't lucky.
Do you remember your first world champion?
What about?
It was in Tegu.
I wanted to get the final, it was a Maximum program.
And he went away from the morning in the pre-spot flights.
Then I realized that smelling and bringing a smell of heads is that there's no way to fly.
Two years later, the World Championship in Moscow has been in the finish with the best time.
I remember my feelings before the decisive conquerment: I wanted to win "good" already!
How is it possible, developing a good speed, not losing the head, not disabled?
And this is the most complex.
It must be very accurate, focused on the technician so that the barriers do not get away.
I noticed that when you face not on the result, but on the process, it's very easy.
And the most chair when you're feeling that you're flying, and it's all like yourself!
Really, it should be.
Many of our attracts from the depths after the first serious success are trying to move closer to the capital.
Didn't you ever have such ideas?
The house's still better.
You don't imagine where I'm without my train, whom I need?
Maybe it would have better, but I'm trying to be satisfied with what I have.
You've been together for a long time?
For 12 years, since I came in a light atletic.
Precisely, I trained his wife who worked with my children, and she already delivered me.
I started with a spant, and then shooted, three.
The child's multitude was when they met a moon, they're walking out of place...
In 14, I tried to run with barriers, and I liked.
From the first time, the second adult rule was able to comply with the standards.
That's how it's been.
Have the fear of barriers ever been?
Sometimes it's possible to agree with them.
But there was always a lot of work on the technology.
It's over one shooting!
But there's nothing to do from this routine.
The technicians have to shoot me on the night, I was up and fly through the bar.
Everyone who saw your seat in Peking claims that it was a very beautiful flight.
Thank you.
I like myself.
I'm normally not keeping my shoes, and I couldn't stay here.
But the effectiveness needs to continue to work - there is no limits of perfection.
Don't you worry now that the winning for a year before the Olympic Game is on a hard load?
In such cases, I try to justify expectations.
Once you chose this way, it's supposed to go to the end.
My trainer likes to repeat: if you're not weak, no additional sweet should feel.
And I'm totally agreed with him.
Lamb Kushanashvili
But not so much I'm going to make me aware of the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are buried, I understand their bread isn't smelling the enemies.
And even though I didn't have a fleet, and that's exactly the same thing, a million times I spoke here, and nobody called the shooting, it's a different job.
All my pseudonyms have been shocked in seconds.
Pressing I'm being so strong that I even, who's making a couple, thinking that people are white.
It's going to go, go, and it's on you, and it's gonna shoot you.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room oral, I'm a sweet, I'm sweet, I'm old, guys, I'm afraid.
Another matter is no support.
I didn't have such illusions, but now...
I've always been self-sufficient, so you're doing it.
And to give passports to such kinds like Fred Derst or Monson, they're just shooting.
I'm better, the best journalist, I'm worried.
A week ago, in Kiev, Dakar Kushanashvili, crymical events were occupied:
What were done with the Cross Mediterranean is a crime.
That's what they call an anonexy.
I believe that the reference to the higher Crochet tried to sign anything, nor in any case is inscribed in the general image of human society.
That's how to come to the neighbor and take him a dinner...
The war from Kremell went, and she's finished only there.
I was almost 100 per cent sure that, as the summer of 2008, it started from a shooter of Cremell's shooting.
I have a proposal who could be...
It's not so long and much to live.
I don't understand, he's the biggest artist, why he's supposed to smell his hands.
Is he losing the apartment?
Well, get him a memory.
Of course, people recalled him as a distressing family.
And the reconciliation now depends only on the Lord's ruler.

" The secretary Kerry understood that the support of Russian President Assad is risking to destroy and enhance conflict, and to undermine our common goal to combat extremism, if we do not concentrate on the search for the solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition, " states the report published on the United States Department's website.
Carry reaffirmed the commitment to the United States to combat the Islamic State Group (the activity prohibited by the Supreme Court in Russia) in coalition with more than 60 States.
According to the hospital, Asad "only can be a reliable member of coalition " .
In the phone conversation, Kerry also stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be permitted by means of a political transition from Asad.
In Belarus, the Russian home was threatened for isolation because of the Asaida regime.
The referred secretary of the White House Joshua Ernesto threatened the exclusion of Russia if it was not stopped supporting Asad.
Ernest, as an alternative, proposed to join an international coalition that conducted anti-terrorism operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media often reported about the presence of Russian military personnel in the Syrian territory.
The head of the Russian Middle Eastern Sergei Lawrence stated that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and helped Syrians to learn the technology to use it against Islamics.
Four of them died when the police opened the resort guns on the protesters in Nepal.
Four men, including the four-year-old boy, were killed in the south of Nepal when the police began a firearm in the ball protesting against the proposed new constitution of the country, as the official representative in the mid-middle stated.

Mr. Dakar reported that the police were using smoke gas, then shooted in the air before shooting rain guns.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were arrested, said he.
There is no understanding why rain guns that can be killed, but they are traditionally used as less dead alternatives have caused such high mortality.
This was the last few weeks of disastrous protests in the Southern, equivalent part of Nepal, where the representatives of Madesia claim that the new provinces of the new Constitution would reduce their political influence.
Protests also passed in the west of Nepal, among the citizens of the talents who want to have their state.
At least 40 men, including 11 police officers, were killed in cruel cuts, starting from 10
August, when four major political parties signed the country's separation agreement on the province, which became a decisive step towards a new Constitution, but a very coherent issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed over a few centuries.
The new Constitution work has been carried out since 2008, but the lawyers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that has led to thousands of people in April.
The lawyers voted for the draft Constitution in Katmanda this week, and the officials said that the new chapter would be signed at Sunday.

So the issue of the security of places in children's gardens today is one of the most active ones.
From 1 September, it was closed to the capital reparatory No. 10 of 320 places.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million rubbers.
Those city resources have not yet been received.
Last year after the repair, a child garden No. 23 was opened, which is currently visiting 200 children.

We're working with the Prosecutor on the Protection of this treaty.
More than the earth under the object is in the federal ownership.
It works with Moscow and is addressed to the transfer of 88 g to the area property with the subsequently transfer of the land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor preparing for reconstruction and launching 1,5 billion rule.

Thanks to the sponsor means, the territory of the city's SAAS could be well-established.
The sponsors helped beauty to notice the Day of the city.
Like in ancient good times, the participation of urban collections and organizations was a paradise.
The city’s airplane, the Sayan Poets book, was issued.
The first manufacturers and persons who have a serious contribution to the development of Sayanska are undertaken for youth melits.
Measures also participate in the urban welfare fund.
The first step was the acquisition of instruments for young talented musicians.
In nine months, more than 8000,000 rule is aimed at supporting talented children to support children who need careful treatment and support children from poor-care families.
How are social care problems resolved in Saansk?
In the city there are no doctors and physicians.
In order to address a career question, there is a major importance for housing specialists.
In the past year, we set five apartments for the doctors and four pedagogs received.
We are working on a housing program with the possibility to stop it for five years.
The plans are the replaning of the building, which will be built by eight other apartments for pedagogy.
The teachers and doctors also participate in the "Gill for Russian Family".
In the perspective of building houses for budgetary workers.
The main thing is that there is a working team with which I can solve the most complex issues in the city.

Google launchs a double-building campaign for the collection of $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the start of a donation campaign for the collection of $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping refugee countries who run from disappeared war and dinner countries.
Google uses an unharmed personal approach by an anonymous campaign for the collection of donations in his blog.
Instead of making a statement, Google Rita Mahof, who fly with the family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described his personal experience.
"We've come to doubtful trains and buses, to suffer hunger, desire, cold, and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many such people, such as my family, are desperately needed for help.
The donations will be provided to the four non-commercial organizations employed by refugees and migrants: “Doctors without border”, the International Save Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that it would take the first $5,5 million of donations until the amount of the google.com/refugeerelief will not reach $11 million.
Europe is opposed to a stronger crisis with refugees during the Second World War, which has risen more than four years of civil war in Syria, which has moved more than four million people in this year.
Many of them are also flying from the covered wars of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetes with small fertility may help the illness surgery
A pleasant effect after the surgery of grain in persons with small oil that suffers diabetes of 2 type may take at least five years, according to the new study.
However, until now, it is early to say that diabetes with small oxygen are more than those who receive non-chirurgic treatment.
"The mortality statistics are not soon shown", said Dr. Robin Bleckstone, a expert on the surgery surgery surgery's new study in the column of JAMA Surgery.
The fertile surgery, or barrier surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the heavy.
They reduce hunger feeling and limit the capacity of organisms to feed.
In a few years, the barritory surgery proved its effectiveness for the treatment of diabetes two, but the main studies were conducted among people with morbide oil index of the body mass (MT) 35 or above.
IMIT, the weight of growth is considered normal, from 18.5 to 24.9.
IMIT 25 or above, it is said that human weight is lost, and people with ICT above 30 are considered to be grained.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study of Tayban hospital researchers, Min-Sheng General used the data collected since 2007 for comparing two barritory surgery types, the smuggling of the skin and hand-hand-gastronomy, with the medication of 2 types of diabetes in small oxide.
The average value of ICTs in the surgical involvement was from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, ICT those who have received non-chirurgic treatment from diabetes remains at the level 29.
Between the transaction moved completely from the diabetes 36 per cent, and partly 28 per cent.
The medication group, for comparison, was only 1 per cent out of diabetes, and only about 2 per cent.
In addition, the blood pressure indicators, triglicerids and the colesterin LPN " were generally better in the surgical group", states the authors.
The investigators also controlled the blood level of A1s, reflecting the blood sugar levels in the dinamic.
Hemoglobin A1c better keep up below 7 percent, writes researchers.
After the surgical involvement, the A1c average hemoglobine was decreased from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
However, in the therapeutic group, he remained stable, about 8 per cent.
However, the best indicators of the gluchemic control reflected by the hypoglobine A1c did not reduce mortality levels for five years, according to Dr. Chi-Heng Su and colleagues.
The research group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared with the hand-good group, the smuggling group had lost more weight (18.7 km against 14.2 km), has increased ICT reduction (0.4 against 5,1) and A1s (3.1 per cent against 2.1 per cent) and was closer to the full remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent against 16.7 per cent).
Although a new study does not demonstrate the advantages of the surgical method in the part of life after five years, there is a confirmation of the results of the investigation of people with the lost body in Sweden that the surgical treatment actually leads to increased life-sufficiency, as reported by Bleckstone from the Medicine College in Finix, the University of Arizona.
According to the Swedish study for persons who elected barritory interference, the possibility of death for 15 years was approximately 29 per cent below compared to a group in which more traditional methods were applied.
In spite of the new study, Blaxton noted that it supported people with ICT below 35 interested in this procedure.
" The report is very important, since it claims that such surgical interaction is safe in the group with low ICT, where there is no increased risk of mortality or sexual disease, " she stated.
Blackstone adds that people and their doctors should start a serious consideration of the weight when the patient is in the diameter between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to put people into this seriously," she said.
I think that when they get genetic changes that start in their body of fertilization and diabetes, it is very difficult to make it again.
In the Mitians, there were 9 million rubbers from the house of the beach.
In the Mitians, slaughterers were attacked in the homes and stolen 9 million rubbers and three women's shoes.
This means "Interfax" with the reference to the IWD Press Service.
The Inspector came on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown ones through the open entrance door went into the house situated on the Garden Street, connected the 20-year-old son of the house and, threatening both feet, slaughtered 9 million rubbers and three shoes.
Previous data, the amount of the damage was $9,265,000, as a criminal case under article “Razboy”.
Fanates from Europe are risking to become homeless.
Only 23 Peterbourg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists that will come in 2018 to see the Championship of the World on Flotball.
Holidays are not intended to receive the permission.
experts believe that it's a very alarming sign.
In the prevention of the world's primary, the authorities must urgently consider how to divid all guests of the city.
The Rosbalt Countries believe that the cost of the coated apartment is 10 to 30 per cent, and that and after the chain of the coal, it must be paid.
The Championship of the Peace on Flatball has emphasized the state of Russian guests.
According to the law written under the first convenence, each hotel Petersburg should be classified and prove that it corresponds to the number of stars and the level of the service.
It is now understood that this is not all: the hotels are so scared of checking that they often have not sent documents to requests of the Federal Anti-monopolis Office for Petersburg.
As Head of the UFAS Vadim Wormlers reported, the State has studied 138 hotels and now plans to establish 34 cases in respect of the guest, many who just did not respond to the anti-mono-users.
There are signs that the leadership of the three decades of companies has been inflicted by a place of one or a different number of stars in the advertising, noted by the Lords.
The problem is that, now on account of each number, no one can be lost before 2018.
The officials suspect that during the football champion, the peterbourg hotels will take all the peterbourgy hotels.
Now, in the city, the tourists can be 30.5.000 numbers.
According to Smolln, in Petersburg, 17 five-year-old hotels, 51 four-star guests, 100-2-thirds, 550 one-stars.
According to the first Vice-Premier Committee on Tourism, only 23 guests had been classified at this time - so much checks were accredited in Petersburg.
If there was some such procedure in regional enterprises, the Smoll of the Surprising Status was unknown.
The last classification may also be more, but no one knows about it.
"The last half of the hotels were not very strict to classify", admitted the Director of the Northwest Division of the Russian Tourist of Ecatherin Shadaki.
This is explained in the high season, during which hotels pay more money and do not want to do other matters.
Another reason is that the budgets in which the checking expenditures were not paid, thereby the guest may depend on the status of 30 to 100 000 rules and more.
However, recently, the guest leaders have been intensified and began to make requests for classification, assured the Shadkian.
The hotels must be repaid until 1 July 2016, not only paying the money, but they do not have the right to work on the world championship.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed payment in the hotel will be developed at the time of the tourist.
The forms for which the value will be calculated are set up in the next year.
This has been done to avoid a 200-300 per cent of prices, for example during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
We need to have conscience and not allow up to two-third times, but the hotels have to pay.
"I think that growth will be up to 50 percent," explained President of the Russian Hospital Association of Gennadei Lamshine.
In its sense, Vadim Warms did not be sure that the fixing of the price corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how this is in the economic theory framework, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better inconsistent travel," he said.
It's not clear that it's going to be with popular decorations.
The Members of the Hospital have introduced a draft law which has to be banned in homes.
We hope that this law will not be adopted or dealing with Petersburg.
"We will leave the point of view that the hostels must be kept," Nana Hawatiya believes.
However, in its words, the mini-actor owners must, in any case, be ready to re-establish the Life Code.
If the Hospital is still endorsing the draft legislation, Peterburg is closed to about 80 per cent of the hostels, and at this time 1.5 thousand numbers.
According to the President of the Re restaurants Federation and the hotels of North Zealand Leonida Harvar, in Petersburg there are no two and three-star hotels, which are once and inhabited by football bottles, as well as the four and five-star hotels.
This situation is similar when "in the 80-month stage, 750,000 wheels are sit."
This can be corrected as once through mini-actors.
The expert's possible prohibition is "ideotic": "It seems strange that one person can live in the apartments, and that's why there is no reason."
If the guest is used as a whole, I agree that it's wrong.
But if you come as a guest in which the guest comes for a short time, why not?
The mini-hospitals are risking to lose the world's football champion and because of their irretrospectiveness.
The whole hundreds of small hotels are simply not able to classify themselves.
All guests of the city will be assigned to work at summer 2016.
"Communities that may not take this procedure so much, therefore they will reject less paid orders from mini hotels but choose those traveling," noted Gennadei Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of the check at this time are significantly higher than the Peterburgians.
The result of Peterbourg Delay is related, including the permanent stops in the Government ' s tourism block, which does not contribute to the balanced work.
Experts believe that if the Peterbourg hotels are not enough, they may have to be focused on the district guests and the dining house.
For example, Petersburg’s 300-year-old celebration may mobilize a fleet, that is, the tourist guests will be able to live in castles.
Furthermore, many skins will be prepared for the shocks where they will be able to be at night.
"It's not to make so many guests that then they're swimming." - He's sure Gennadey Lamshin.
The large population will also be used during the football primary.
The most likely all in the city will build coffee reserves.
Rail lines will grow up to 10 to 30 percent.
"It is clearly the first ones will go near the stadium," said a specialist on the Agency for Development and Research in Laris Bragin.
The price of the rail may not be returned to the previous level after the champion, especially in bed areas.
This will contribute to the construction of new transport links in the area of the city, emphasized.
It should not be forgotten by human qualities.
For example, Leonard Harvard is confident that Peterburg was always a hospital city in which people are not simply aware of the road but may still be a mini-exploration.
There's also complications.
My father, in the 1970s, met a family from Murmanska, a father, the mother and two children.
There were some nights where the guests were hard to sleep on the board.
"And the dad brought them to our communal apartment," she remembered the cousin.
Indeed, it added that this person was not left in the cities - to say to her home that there were consequences and fears.
But may the errors of hotels and Governments should have been remembered in 2018 after the unsuccessful decisions of the Council?
The Julian's "Sends" of the Amorian area.
Today, with enthusiasm, he looked at the clause of the Jürinus in Gosmid.
He did such things when our generation was still learned to trade newspapers, and it is still a beautiful form.
The topic, like "the LDR protest against the outcome of the Amirian elections".
Protocols are not triggered - because there is nothing; other protocols, except signed by the elections, are in the LDR, judged in all.
Here he spends on the second place of Ivan Abram, and cries something like: "This is the winner of the elections."
And there's nothing to do with Rodney, and then, after the chair, the fraction from the meetings, "You're all with the fronts of your wheels and sweet."
The press, of course, is not Abraamova, but the skandal and demarch of the fraction as a result of the scandale and distress.
In reality, Volfoovic was beautiful and elegantly shocked in the Amuria area together with Abram.
For the whole country, this is the normal path of the Jürinus style, and it is not the protest of the political party against the results of specific elections.
And the fraction was formally scanned, and the elections, if you believe the party website and the Facebuck Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leaders of the subject evidently cry.
He offers the dead in Amore to guard his dead, and it is a message against the only Russians in the whole and nothing that has not been convicted to Rodney.
A great decision to not lose the face, and in the real, but not the shown scandal is not going.
Another thing is now that Abram itself is in a strange situation.
On the other hand, he did not expect anything, no alternative protocols.
He is not in public attention, on the other hand, and on the other hand, he became formal and to detrimentate the respected champion, and, in other words, the Champagners in the ER and the UNFF address.
And there, of course, he must really think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, policy number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 to the only area of one-handled area, it can be converted into a couple that has been successfully used by its own party leadership and super-speaker for the ONG itself and for the party leadership of the foreign.
That's exactly that it wouldn't be Jürinus, he would have been able to think and to observe him almost.
It's still growing and growing to him.
The news showed that LDR returns to the same plenary during the next plenary.
That's what the bath is going on.
On the one hand, Abram’s theme is polluted.
It's really red.
"It's impossible to all come to Europe."
Europe cannot take all refugees, stated that the real decision of the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetian Buddhists called to stop violence in refugee countries.
The continued crisis of refugee crisis was addressed to the opening of the Centre of Commons in Oxford, dedicated to the Ethica study, at the beginning of its 10-day visit in Britain.
He stated that in existing circumstances humanity interests should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this results in refusal, the reaction of Western European countries to the crisis of refugees is not adequate.
"It's impossible to all come to Europe," he said.
Although Dalai Lama highlighted the efforts undertaken by Germany and Austria towards the crisis, he stressed that it was only a timely decision.
"The concern of thousands of refugees is beautiful, but at the same time you should think about long-term decisions how to bring real peace and current development, mainly through education, in these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we should consider how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We need to deficit the use of force.
The application of the force has never solved these problems," he added.
On violence, Dalaylama also commented on the action of George Bush after the terrorist acts 9/11, said that the US cruel reaction had laid down an uncontrolled event.
After 9/11, I expressed my confusion in the letter to President Bush and said that the problem could be addressed by non-weapon.
I know that his purpose was good, but he used strength, and it caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Four democratic growth in the last 4 years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported about almost 400 per cent increase, starting since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age that have been declined with high sperm maintenance, as reports the Toxicology Centre of Georgia.
According to Dr. Galorda Lopes, director of the Toxicology Centre of Georgia, the case of proclamation of children to 12 years of illness for the declination of hands reported in the toxicological centre increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"The children are contacting these substances more and, unfortunately, some percent are sent to the rapid assistance office," said Lopes CNN.
He told some children that drinking a special deficit, and some do this to make an impression on their friends or opposite social networks.
The YouTube video shows that adolescents have a desinfictive glucose as a deteriorate drink on youth.
The report reports that adolescents have shocked the deficiency of stir-containing liquidity for the swallowing of the rat to get more stronger drunk.
Childs of age may touch the pleasant smokes of desinfictive lowness.
"The baby doesn't think it could hurt him," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractives (disfixing skins for hands) are aromatised.
There are deficiencious leverages for hands with clobs, wine and apple, which are very attractive for children.
The deficiency of the hand contains 45 to 95 per cent of the spurt.
In small children, in particular, only a number of disorders can cause alcohol equality.
“ It's a high-century split,” said Fox 4 in Cansas City, Dr. Steven Thornton, the principal doctor of the Toxicology Center at the University of Cansas.
You wouldn't just leave a whiskey with a visa, but people keep these deficient materials for your hands, and if children get to them, it's a fast way to use a large number of alcohols.
Rassel, a six-year-old girl who recently promoted a deficit instrument for the hand with a clubic aroma in a number of approximately four discounts, was sent to the ambulance office.
The level of alcohol in it was 179, two times more than the adult, which, in law, is considered to be in the condition of alcoholic abuse, says Dr. Chris Ritchy, a doctor of rapid assistance that had been treated in the Gwinnett medical centre, not far away from Atlanta.
He traveled to his words and couldn’t walk when she was given to the office of rapid assistance.
The doctors watched her all night in a single child clinic, not to miss any signs of the brain trauma, because the girl fell down and shooted the head, said Ritchy.
“It was very scared,” said CNN, the Scott Order, the mother of Naziy.
This could be dead for my child.
Lopes recommended that parents and teachers use non-pilot substances or dismissing salphates, in addition to strike out deficiencious skins for children’s reaching zone.
In addition to alcoholic deformation, some desinfiant hydrogens are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after the declination of the instrument containing a toxicly not identified ingredient.
Health workers suspect that the product contains metal is a death agent, not a physician spill that was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three four-quarter students in the north of New York were condemned to compare their "contrast" teacher through the "distribution of antibactrial substances in the class", according to the police report.
The teachers were a strong allergic for desinflors to hand, and she prohibited to keep them in their class.
The police believes that the unsuccessful plan was " post-spread", and addresses the issues of the educational disciplinary.
As the oldest child library in Barnabas, he became a family club.
At the end of the castle, the N.N.K. is a magnificent sweet sweet in their shoeting library.
The young ones who are looking for books are trying to smile her confects.
Some generations have been in the library for 95 years.
The first readers in the last twenty years have been cut here with a slight piece, spectacles in Mayako’s, literature vectors and switch with his wife Lenin.
The record continued four years, and, as wrote in 1939, the "Young Encyclopedia" newspaper, with every day "Family between the Hope of the Constantine Group and friends of the City of Barnabas" became more strong.
The hope of Constantine has even sent the far away from the barnaul friends to his child's photo.
And when the barnaulers asked, whether Constantine’s hope is not intriguing her name, he wrote that no.
The letters are long covered in the museum, and the first readers have to explain whose bad profile steals the barrier in the library building.
In the years of rebuilding, different people were calling, and why is the child’s library not renamed?
Please be a library of name a good child writer, without a political shock!
The village libraries workers thought and decided to leave everything.
It's the most famous and loved library in Barnabas as "Leinkie" in Moscow.
On the ground in the library, a trail from a yellow cyrpipea.
"The Origin of the Delicate City" is the favorite theme of the artist Oli Moscowy.
Oila was a legal manager, was eighth working and was five, and all other managers were different from love for qualification.
And then there was an advertising in the Internet, "I need a illustrator for a book."
The book wrote a little American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "Mother cancer in my mother."
And I thought that life could end at any time, and there will be no miracles in it if you don't create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates the children’s books of the world, and its own statements.
Traditionally, children lose interest in the book that they are still living in some virtual space...
But there are children readers, and their parents understand the importance of reading -- tells the Russian Planet Director of the Tatiana Kushvid Library.
In the past few years, we have even been assured that the child's library needs, and it's going to live - kids are going here!
I think it's interested to read again.
The library is a large exhibition with updated photo exhibition.
Once in the quarter, there are new photos of readers in the entire family library: mother, father and children.
The library is pleased that the pope has always come to their children.
If a child had been read all the Cookies in two years, he needs a more complex book.
But now the law under which the eighth-year-old vulners are prohibited to issue books from category 12+.
To obtain such a book, the child must bring their parents to herself - they come back and then return, and the "Cruz" slowly becomes something like a family club.
In the library, a revolutional collectioner was sweet and herms, conducted the King in the annex to the New York magazine in 1936.
Because we are now not just a conceptual book-making space, we are now open to move, we are trying to become a special place: not a house, not a job, not a school, Tatiana Kushvid explains.
We can come here to read, play, shoot all together.
We've made a game area for a little kid comes just to play, and the hands still go to the book!
Some of our parents are shooting, and they are shooted with their feet, and they don't want to leave.
Often, Moms come with shoes - and we are glad that the library is the first place between all the rest of the places where they have to come with the little girls.
The mother of Kushvid says: The modern children like the classic child literature as we have ever said:
"The creative matter is now developed, and a lot of attention is given to the authors who are a linking agreement between generations."
And if they talk about small children, they are important to be a hero that travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like to stay with their heroes.
The library continues to issue books for parents who tell that there is a child ' s modern literature, which books should be focused on and why.
The bottles are so encouraging and encouraging that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
The issue of books on the front of the read room for adults is prohibited.
This magnificent prize only has children.
...In the latest library room, there is a square box with an old wooden board in a box.
The girls will shut up under your steps -- it's a very old time machine.
With your childhood book you're seeing like old friends: Hello, well, we're not changed with you.
Ellie is still pleasantly walking on the way shooted by the wild skippich, the rings of the Toil Riggs slaughtered magic shoes, and Malchish-Kibalchish did not say to the smells of the Military Military shoes that he had a strong word.
The books are like the passwords, they can know their own in any place.
There are roots in the storage and the actual books - for example, the revolutionary collectioner had been with the souls and hermes.
Or to conduct King in a famous annex to New York magazine.
Or the "Morsilky" in 1936.
The time was stood, the page was cut into the tea.
These publications are no longer issued to readers.
It's our future collection, and I'm all dreaming - I'll go to the pension and take younger children's books.
But the kids aren't going to say, and the beautifuls in old books aren't very light, and the theme are opening the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now I think, why did we all write this Pioneer Truth?
But it was still interesting, - says the Russian Planet, Galina Elisa, who launched a book guarding.
Morsilica's pages were shocked from time.
Galina's life is keeping a book.
She knows the color of Buratino, in which Harry Potter's training year was the captain of the Griffindor Championship in which situations Carlson uses a motorist, and who works as the father of Alice Severine.
The library work is little paying, and everyone who can live without these books is very quickly finding another professional.
There are only the most convinced ones: teachers, pedagogues, workers of the book culture.
They can also know that it's a professional parent of the child's library.
If he rid you in the first minute of conversation, it's a professional.
I really love the children's books: as the library I like to be that they should be precisely and beautifully standing on the fields, and I also like to read them, says Galina Vietnam.
I'm reading everything: military, historical behavior, statements, fantastics.
Reading the modern Russian authors, the traduction of...
Of course, I think there was everything else in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and inspiring of everything that happened with me then.
And as I was ridiculous to love them, I thought the library was a magnificent place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sit and read.
I hope the book will always be, despite the riders.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring children, and the grandma...
Listen: The Sleece is not a difference.
The Graphits checked discussions on the disagreements in Sertica after the recognition of Dale that "Hupps" in a bad situation, but it will correct it.
Harts will protest against the complaint of the Skotland Fitbon Association to Neilson, and Warberton is threatening the signing of contracts in January, which might be violated by the team.
"Dons" has increased the advantage before "Settick" to 5 points
Adam Runey's pants in the first shuttle gave the "Averdin" small advantage on Hamilton in Pittdore, which allowed Dons to rescue from "Selectics" at five points.
graphics on the verification of discussions on disputes
This has been hearing about the differences in the Sertica, which were confronted by Griffits, claiming that he and his team partners were not suffering from any enhanced critical, preparing for meeting with the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think that the games try to him.
The Dutch's fault because the Skotlandians are not in the fight against the title - de Bur
The former Reyngers and the former member of the United States, Ronald de Burr, said that the Dutch football farmers had lost interest in Sertica because he was not coherent to the title of the Rangers.
Where Bour, currently the representative of Acks, said, "The most appreciative moments in the Netherlands are no longer shown in the "Seltica" game and why?"
That's because it's not the Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Reangers' return.
They're talking about the Star Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interesting.
The Star Company plays a lot of pressures, and not only people in Skotlandia want to see these games.
"I'm all changed," said Dale
Ronnie Dale acknowledged that "Settick" had difficulties, but the Norwegian trainer shouted everything to change.
According to the "Malma" and, as a result, the Champion League immediately took the game of 10 footballists of "Aberdin", which now takes the top table building up to five points.
But Dale said, "The Selitha was bad and before, and we will go again."
Now we want to get out of this as fast as possible.
I understand that it's very enormous, and there's a lot of people very, very bad or disappointed of what happens.
And we too, but we need to continue.
And we really need the "Seltica" support because the games are much better.
Stay together now so important.
Warberton is incredibly waiting for the Year transfers
Despite the view that the whole weeks ago, those who predicted that he determined some of the purposes of the January Transfers, the boss of the Rangers Mark Warberton is incredibly related to the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the team.
The former Brentford attacker said: "The Yenvar transfer window is very different from the summer window."
With regard to the players that come to the summer, you have a period before the beginning of the season for their adaptation, which you have seen in our own group in this season.
The team's really good work.
Sometimes there is more damage to add unnecessary players to those you really need.
The question that "Settick" was interested in finishing the carriage.
The shooting "Soonsy" Mich, linked to "Settick" during the transfer window, noted that he could leave a football after the contract was completed with the Libye.
29-year-old player suffered from a shipping problem for two years, and he couldn't leave Wells this summer.
Harts will oppose the SFA claims of Neilson.
Harts took account of 2:1 when Patterson was removed, and began playing 3:2, but the red protector card was later cancelled; this is the third red card of Columbus, which was cancelled for eight months.
Neilson is not rejected by my words, saying, "I didn't make any doubt of the ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffits promised to avoid Tynkash.
Hybernian's direct player received a conversation after acknowledging that the song was sweet words about the former Harts game Rudy Skycell.
The university occurred in the Rooseburn area in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Deb in Tainkasle in March 2014.
"It was a shock, and it was shocked," he said, "I'm certain that I wouldn't go back to Tainkash if he doesn't play for "Slectic."
Donnelly: The Tannadis Council is confident in the "Dandy Youngth" mine
Simon Donnelly states that the Board of Directors of Danny Yunetted is still sure that the manager's team will change the situation to the best, but agrees that the deterioration of the field is to be done.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the people to go again," said Donnelly.
MacInnes is glad that he won Hamilton.
Dereck Macinez acknowledged that his "Abertin" team had to struggle with Hamilton Assis to achieve the seventh winning in the first line, which had put them up to five points above the "Seltica", above the tourist table, through Adam Runey's panels in the first time.
MacInes said, "No team that would have winned anything is a cup or a liga liga that did not win the meetings like this."
The level of unemployment among Skotlands is not changed, while the United Kingdom is in general growing
BEZRABITY in Skotland remained a level of 164,000 people from May to July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom in general increased from 100,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployed level in Scotia was 5,9 per cent higher than the United Kingdom at 5,5 per cent, as shown by National Statistics Service (UNS).
At the same time, employment in Scotia has fallen 12 000 in three months, with the number of workers now 2 612.000.
Scotland ' s employment level was decreased by 74.0 per cent, above the average 73.5 per cent of the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Scotland, David Mandel, commanded the most recent digits, said: "The Government's long-term plan has set the basis for strengthening the economy."
It has been almost a serious year since the Scotia has taken a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen the further improvement of the situation in the market in Scotia in the growth of employment and the reduction of unemployed people.
Why I Is A Witness in Oclahom
Today, adorning from legal involvement at the late stage, I'll see how people say it.
If this happens, and I hope it's not yet, I'll sit on the sight gate of the mortality camera in the state of Oklahoma, when Richard Glossip's smiling with a dead injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
The first request was made in January, through his close friend, and even though I was back to shock, I agreed.
With the nearness of this day, I was afraid.
So why do you do that?
I agreed, as I thought it was a good way to tell the detailed history of the death penalty.
This would propose a unique racism.
Yes, journalists are authorized to attend punishments in America, and because those who desire more often than the place, the results of the lady lottery decide who will be chosen.
The number of press locations were reduced from 12 to five.
Whoeverever has been chosen, he'll look at it without emotions.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit with the closest friends of Richard Glossip, and we've got our relationship with him after a few months of phone calls and one visit over two and half hours.
I like this guy.
We're often laughing when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not allowed to take a block and hand to write what I see.
I have to try to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklakoma accused me in Twitter that I do my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes to get access.
I sweared her.
She acknowledged that it could "we could" but she still believed that I was wrong with what I do.
Richard Glossip did not agree with what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me that to write, and I wouldn't do this even if he said.
I told him that he could get me out of his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants the journalist of the international publisher to write it there.
If he dies, he believes that it helps the movement of the death punishment.
Kim Belver, the reporter of Haffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this, listen to the subscriptions I wrote.
I'm not going to get here in detail again.
I can't say with sure that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
His acts after the murder, Barry Van Trezee, are guilty of crime.
But I believe there's a great chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I am strongly sure that the authority for the death condemnation was not sufficient.
I think his punishment is wrong.
And from this cancer I'll see how he's going to die.
I can't say that I'm the entire objection.
It will be other reporters to which it is possible.
From me you know how this is to look like a man who loves me dies without the need.
The prosecution of the human police was dealt with out of the Canning River
The Canning-Well Constellation has been able to talk to a man out of the Canning River, and he himself remains sweet.
The people of Perta intended to go from the police, but they didn't worry, shooted into a smooth water in a few meters from the police officer who tried to "speak to talk to him to the beach".
The Canning Wail police was sent on Tuesday on the illicit prosecution of the Foreign Territory in Bakkingue.
When the police were noticed the suspected, he tried to get out of them and leave to Canning.
But he wasn't too far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, let's miss me," said the senior sergeant Chandel Castle.
The Laclan Perhavez constitute was not very desired to make a form, so he used a more safeer receipt - " negotiations with a good police."
"Atimes people do weird things to try to escape", says the senior sergeant Kassidyn.
Footballist-chumpion Ben Cassince's just remembered it.
In 2006, Cassince went to the cube to avoid meetings with the police patrol to check alcohol and tried to move Soon.
His efforts were shocked, but the local people were understood to discover the shooting "Ben Cassince Biatlon".
Peter Mudy accused the sports in trying to spy and threaten to get out of the end of the sport
Peter Mudy accused Racing Victoria to spend in his past year and threatened that the final sport would continue immediately.
His motion became the shore and staff of the Racing Victoria Technology Division, which he accused that they organized a personal campaign against him, and that from the old Lady Tatai, because of the violation of the rules of use of drugs in the old day, in the midst, the last shock was.
Museo reported Fairfax Media that he always illustrated all the efforts that participated in the castle, and he was in a difficult situation when he was talking about the positive outcome of the Leders to what he could not explain.
He maintained the language of suspicion in the spy for half a year and did not want to "seen as green wine".
"I wouldn't speak anything about it, and I suffered a long time, but sometimes you're so exciting from the colea that you're not going to stop," Musdi said.
They know that it's continued.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep strongly.
I want to walk with a high-standing head and I want my owners to know - I do everything to them.
When they're gonna start thinking that's not so, then I'll have to stop being a trainer.
Then I have to think what to do with my license.
The Museo had previously declared a sense during the interview at the racing.com that the Technology Division tried to spy in his chariot.
"Every year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart sit in a room with a man I'm calling if they ask him, and they invited him to work in my chair to give information about what I'm doing in the chariot," said Mudy at Racing.com.
They're apparently thinking I'm a smoker.
If so, all of them should, of course, make a statement because the attempt to get me out of them has failed.
Robert Rollton, former RVL Chairman, David Mudy, current Chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, the executive director of RVL, knows about it all the time and now.
Should this make me think that the case becomes personal?
Should the RVL be courageous and respond to what happens in this business, other people other than trainers?
Do I Become this Professional?
Is that what I'm bad for this professional?
Maybe people think it's like that.
Maybe they're gonna have to take my license and put me out, and I don't doubt what I'm saying now, I can let them think about it.
But I came right now to the point where I'm all right, and that's my smile.
I'm sorry for this.
I will give pressure to them and be responsible for their decision-making.
I have a family support, and I can go.
The trainer was only growing during a long investigation of the case with the cobalt and the leaders, and the latest removed horses from the age ordered him to claim that he could "exclude his license on the table".
Museums, most well known to prepare an unbelievable champion of Blake Kaviar, called for the use of medical preparations on the day of the "measurable" resignation after the legs of the horses were made compressed from the grain, which is a violation of the rule.
That's a violation of the rule on the box.
"I must take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my wrong workers made her complaint on his feet.
She could get a complaint last night.
She could get him yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the flight.
The museums may be dismissed for three months in accordance with the rules for the application of medical preparations on the day of decrease for the use of the composite, which opened the investigation.
It's an anecdote.
Those who establish these rules do not know anything about horses.
"We all know that we need a rule, but that's too far," said Musdi.
Training and switching from the place of Cabecue in Kyriam, arrested
The police was arrested by a person who had been arrested in the weekly motocyclist in Kyriam and hidden from the place of the event.
The motociclist was put on a helicopter in the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious wounds after the slaughter of the car on Murray Welle Hawaii on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver was gone, not stopping to help a fervent motorcycle.
On Monday, the 50-year-old residence of the city of Natal was the police in Sheparton.
It is expected that it would be pronounced to leave a place of occurrence, non-assistant assistance and to violate other rules of road movement.
Motociclist, 40-year-old Cypriot, remains in a stable hospital.
Melbourne Storm Trainer, Craig Bellma, plays the accused of conspirators in the use of cruel force admissions
Melbourne Storm train, Craig Bellma, called the shooting criticism of his shooting team as a "enlinkment of the agenda" by two NRL chariot favorites.
The Sidney Rusters trainer, Trent Robinson, stated that the judges allowed Storm to fight with his team during the emergency victory of the Storm in the end of the qualified game in Sidma on Friday night.
Brian Bronkos trainer Wayne Bennet made an outstanding shoot on "Stom" after his team wined a qualified tournament at Northern Quinnishand Kabowyz at Saturday night when he called this "typical" game for the line and said that two of the Queensland teams weren't "successful" in the leading appeal.
Bells protected the shooting of their team and claimed that they were just focused on the "contact" by shooting the legs.
Bellham added that he had the confidence of his team ' s criticism from two leading trainers, since this means that they were concerned about the possible slaughter of the " St. " .
"I didn't hear that Trent Robinson talked about heavy receptions when they played us with account 242," he said in the midst.
I can command that we have not changed anything in our systems or technicians, just in the past six weeks, we have given special attention to contacts when we smell, and that was a turning moment for us.
There's three years, and he's evidently training a good team, so he's probably not a chance to play, and it's been a little tricky for him.
It's amazing how it is always shown in this year.
Bellham talked to Bennett's idea about the impressive football, remembering his teacher, that "Sint-Jorge-Ellavar Dregons" had winned Bennett in the champion in 2010, showing a sweet football.
Wayne's talking about the hidden football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our Tuesday night, and see how impressing their game was," noted Belize.
I remember that in 2010, Saint-Jorge was a little criticized, called a sweet team, and Wayne said that it wasn't worried about it.
But now he has a team that can show what he is thinking of as an impressive football, especially his young half-defenders with their speed.
It's a football that you'd like to play when you have such games.
He made this observation in 2010, and now he wants to all play in his style - not in each team, there are two defenders such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, that they can play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things, because some of them are worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they arrived to the big game.
Bellham also noted that the "Storm" and "Rosters" game was consistent with a large number of sights than the Bronscope and the "Kaboiries" game.
The Broncks game probably was good, I didn't see her, but what was the account? 16-12?
He was at our game 20:18, had two other attempts - and that's what's the impressive football?
Or consider impressing interruptions and unexpected attempts?
It's a rutin for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some stage we can meet them there.
The "Storm" at the end of this week, as they wined the right to take the North Quinnishand Kaubyos, or "Cronalla Sharx" on Saturday afternoon at the AAMI Park station, tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Prosecuted for the conservation of drugs serbs is employed by $2000,000
A man who is threatening the life prison for the attempt to spend 40 kilos of cocaine in Quinsand contrabando has been launched by $2000,000.
Marco Maximich, 29 years old, was one of the five arrested in the last month after the federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay ice from South America through the Vanuatu and was shocked in Kumer in August.
Over the morning, Maximuit and his messagers were watched at the stage, and later he met them in Coomera Roadhouse, where the police had found 40 km of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximich threatens the deadline for the purchase of drug substances in the number of enough to sell, the lawyer Maximich claims that the evidence that the last tried to prevent the whole party is missing, and that a man could be in the coffee without any meaning.
The Supreme Court of Justice, Peter Flanagan, doubted that Maximecvith was supposed to have been delayed.
The last report has been linked to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the court in the midst.
In the crime, he lied to the police about the place of his arrival.
The mothers and fathers of Maximich were proposed to put a joint loan to $200,000 for his release.
"The two statements are apparently that the amount of $20,000 is too large for them," noted the judge Flanagan.
But one of the measures is inadequate as a guarantee that it would not disappear, added the judge.
Maximec has been allowed to be released under the lock, provided that it would be held as an Australian and Serbian passport, to be noted every day in the police and to observe the comandant hour from 6 hours to 6 a.m.
Phoenix Cacicaris: "I'm going to strive to the last seconds of Greece."
The main trainer of the Greece Fox Cacicaris gave his team after the 1/4 shop of Evobolaket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
He said, the judge of the game has decided individual errors.
It was a big game, quoting AFP Kacicaris.
We were ready to play a good game in the execution of the Spanishs.
They were forced to work in the defence, but defence errors were identified by a meeting court.
It's painful, but I'm proud of my boys.
They've been fighting for the last seconds.
Joel Friend: "The CSC will be placed on me for the function of Kain."
The CIA Joel Friend said he wouldn't believe in the wicked army.
The British man also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break the negative trend and finally win Eurolygu in the next season.
I talked to the trainer Dimtris Studis several times this year and, just after I joined the team, quotes "R-Sport" Fredland.
Yeah, I need some time to rebuild the central position, even though I played more forward.
But now it's going to be more to resist to the great central counterparty, but I've already done it, so I think, and now I'm doing it.
The army wins the last time in 2008.
Since then, they had six times to Final four, but they couldn't show their best basket.
It's the opinion that somebody's shocked the team.
All this game, you can't run forever.
Of course, it's complicated. I understand all the disappointment of the club and his ballers.
But we have a good team now, and if we're showing the best thing we can, we've got a good chance to win Euro, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the mosquitoes have run to the tourist, and I think this year will be the CSCC year.
With regard to the slaughter, I am not a sovereign man and I don't believe in any wicked one.
I believe in hard work and decision-making if you connect these two things, it's all possible.
I don't have any certain rituals before playing. I'm just listening to music and trying to relax the way it is possible.
Louis Enrique: "I'll be special to Roma with me."
The main trainer of Barcelone, Louis Enrique, was not to hide that he returned to Rome to the 1nd tour of the Champion Tower of Champion with Roma with special feelings.
According to the employer, his current and ex-committee will not be rowned for him.
Remember, Louis Enrique trained ships in the season 2011/12, but did not have to show himself with the best part of the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I got a certain experience.
I have only warm memories with Rome.
This will be a special game for me, but that's not so important.
The main thing is to try champions in Liga.
The august meeting at the Kuba Johan Hamper does not affect the team's action in the nearest match.
I'm waiting for the "Roma" game she showed in the A series against the United States.
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Wadim Scriptchenko: "Crasnodar" has various options of attacking action.
The responsibilities of the main “Urala” train in the predicting of the 9th squeeze of the first slope with the "Ronnodar" noted the diversity of the attacking team schemes.
According to the employee, "boys" have a number of models in their architecture.
The unit will be 21 September and begin at 16.30 at Moscow time.
How we're gonna play with "Rosnodar" we're looking at, it's bringing the official "Urala" website.
We've got a whole week of training.
This team has different action options, and many times its attacks, and we are not less late, so I think that it will be very interesting.
In prevention of this game, considering that "Ronnodar" is the Liga of Europe against the Tormund Burundi, we're trying to be very well prepared to win.
Rocher Kanez: "Astana House" can select the shoes with whom you want."
The Astana Protector Roher Cannez, after the 1st tour of the group tour of Championians with Benfia (0:2), expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team game in the future.
The Astana's view is that there is a ability to select the shoes in any slaughter.
Despite the matching has been hard to us, I can say that we have played well, - it brings the official WEFA's words of Canas. - We haven't got a little bit of courage in the attack.
"Banfick" above the class, but in the home match, I think we can figure out on their eyes.
It's real.
But first we need to think about the Galatazara and then about Atleticco.
In home shops, we can shoot out anybody.
Rafael Bentes: "After how many times it is: Cristinana Ronald is the best in the world."
The main trainer Rafael Bentes expressed the satisfaction of the great victory in the 1st tour of the Champion tower of Championen with Shatter (4:0).
The specialist gave a position for the Christtian Ronald forum, who became the author of the three heads.
Matt wasn't easy because "Shatter" could be able to have a shirt, it brings the official WEFA words of Bentis.
There were no few moments, but their constraints are always in danger.
I don't say that Real played perfectly, but we had the blue opportunities.
I'm glad that we didn't lose the legs and killed four.
Cristinana Ronald confirmed its level.
This is the best game in the world, I repeat it as many times.
Jordi Alba: "Cristyan Ronald can't compare Messia."
The Barcellona Protector, Jordan Alba, believes that nobody can compare with his colleague Lionel Messy.
According to Spain, Christine Ronald's Real Force can not do this.
Le Figaro Albu's 5 heads above, quotes what Leo can do, no one can.
Even Christine Ronald.
Leo's all changed, I can't compare him with anyone.
Daniel De Rossy: "Barcelone" is not only unique, but also clear individuals.
The Roman Protector Daniel De Rossy, a group tournament of Championships with the Barcelone, noted the importance of compacting and smuggling in the game with such a strong counterparty.
The meeting will be held tomorrow, starting at 21.45 at Moscow time.
Remember, the CE will take its text transmission.
Barcelone is a special partner, a good team with beautiful games, quotes the official WEFA de Rossie website.
It is difficult to play with blue, because they have not only unique styles but also clear individuals.
To leave them, we'll have to smell over the shock and smell each other.
The Messianics are almost successful when they are in the process, so we need to keep compliance and organizationality.
He hopes to get out of the SCA in a sloveny machine with Slovan.
The SCA Elijah Eve emphasized the hope that the army would be in the next composition of the CHL champion.

Steven Hog uses a girl's phone to put the pedofils to send a photo
Pedofil used a 11-year-old phone to request images of violence on children.
Steven Hog took a telephone when she was sleeping, registered into the Internet Service, where a number of unacceptable pictures received by other users.
The girl wakeed up, finded a phone lost and found him in the hand of Hogg.
She checked it and found shocked photos, after which she immediately focused on the attention of her mother.
The police came and saw five images after he investigated the computers found in this address, and found " appropriate" requests for the search system using words to discover inadequate images of children.
Gog then declared the police that he did it because it could be "training the pedofils" and then he would "declare that he was a policeman to fear them."
The author of the judiciary, Elid Robertson, reported to the officer in Dani: "He said that it was a tragic, he tried to fear people.
He acknowledged the requests on the computer, but he said that it was because he wanted to make a police to worry the pedofils.
He was asked about the conversation with an unknown person who sent his pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to load them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he drinked, and said he wanted to see the images of violence and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found a photo on the phone, she called her mother, dry and cry.
She saw inadequate phone images, and then the accused was carried out.
The girl was requested and reported that the accused used computers and "Placeshen" to talk to the girls who looked much more like him.
Hog, 23, from Ward Road in Danije, acknowledged himself of the accused accused of making unacceptable photos of children on June 14, last year, violating the conditions of the tax on 25 January of that year and not in the court to listen on 24 March this year.
The lawyer Gregor Sim called for no request to put Hogh into the list of sexual crimes, since it could be proved that the crime was not a "important sexual element".
Sheriff Alistar Carmachel has delayed a sentence to October before receiving social services.
Hog was discharged under this case, but he was taken in detention before listening to other remaining cases.
It was listed in the list of persons who have committed sexual offences before the sentence was sentenced.

Captain Arsenal, Michael Artet says that his colleagues should support the traumated Jack Wilshire before playing with "Dinamo Zaw"
In the conversation with William Winger, he also stressed that only September was only, and that, if the Wilshire's rebuilding would be planned, nothing would prevent him to turn back to Christmas.
With the most appreciative development of the Whilshire events, at least four next games in England will have been clear and, taking into account the success, its participation in the Championship of Europe remains in the next year.
Both in this recent problem is that Wilshi had certainly completed the previous season with the only trauma ship and was going to return to the accurate aggressive style of game during the pre-session preparation.
Wenger: "The trauma is not threatening his carriage."
It's not just before the end of the living bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just a case.
This is not related to ships or traumas that it had happened before.
This may be related to medical point of view, but, as Wenger has allowed, there is a slightly risk of additional trauma for any player returning to the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant train.
According to the Primier Injuries Ltd, William has 23 different traumas, which have occurred with him for six years since his debt.
He also played only in 65 of 157 "Arsenal" games in the liga for the last five seasons.
If you look at the "Arsenal" schedule wide, you can note that in six of the eighth seasons, starting from 2007 to 08, "Arsenal" was one of the two Premier Line clubs, which accounted for the most delayed days.
Wenger recognizes the possibility of shocking in the portrait, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of the raw statistics will continue in the last season.
"In time, returning back to the trauma, you're being vulnerable for some time - for that time you need to restore the power and take the competitive advantage," said Winger.
Jack's enough young, and it's going to be.
I hope he'll restore physically, I'm sure that his carriage will be the one he wants.
Arsenal begins the Championship campaign in the Mediterranean with "Dinamo Zagreb" and continues to play on Saturday with "Celly" and the next environment, with "Tethenham Hotspur", and Wenger intends to break up the composition.
Dr. Belerin and Aaron Ramzi did not come to Croatia, so they would like to play the mother Debush and Artite.
Wenger may also include Kiran Gibbs and Olivia Jyrus instead of Nacho Morella and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and to give a little preview to players that it needs," said Winger.
Although the Arsenal is unreasonable in the F Group, the Maximim Stadium in Zagreb is the most excited in Europe.
"Deanmo" hasn't lost any of 41 pieces since they've been able to pass the past season as "unbelievable".
On Tuesday night, the earthquake of 3,2 balls on the Ritter scale was affected by the station.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is sure that Arsenal has saved the lessons received in the past season when the team has suffered a shock in the League of Champions from Monaco, and remains a weak hope to bring a club to the end of the Championship.
"It's an incredible wheel," Winger noted.
Arsenal has never done this.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I was realized with the article.
We have anamions, but we don't have a dream.
FriendsFest: Commodity show that offered us a serious lesson of a man’s friendship
The absence of such stories is shocked in the eyes, especially if it is aware of how disappointed men have been, now more than ever, while the level of self-assault among young men is at maximum 15 years.
This became the only major cause of death of men between 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom in 2013, and the male is three times more than women.
In trying to deal with the issue of the "Campania against Unfortunate Life", the Year of Man announced a year in order to leave the calls of culture that does not give men to help when it needs.
The friend is in the center of this battle to take the calls.
Recently, more than 2.000 universities who show symptoms of depression showed that if the patient had a sufficient number of normal friends, the chances of elimination are being obtained.
On the other hand, those who are not in depression, the circle of mentally healthy friends two reduces the possibility of mental disorders.
But, of course, that friendship works, first of all, that she is.
When communications are managed by social networks when the style prefers, the rapid response is often more than the content of contact.
Our digital life depends on the need to be a strong, loved joy and success, even if the reality has a single rule.
Such supernatural success depends on the fact that psychologists call for external values - money, age, social status, the purpose of internal values, our internal efforts to personal growth and friendship, which affects our mental health.
And as you recently noticed one billion, a video player, you're not buying more happiness for money.
The dignity of Friends is that they focus on this attention.
Each person was not defined by his work, but, likely, through the personality that had been identified in association with friends.
Yumor Joey and the permanent chairs of Chandler, the moments of the football review, the remarks of the Russian Rachael's remarks, all come from the understanding that men may feel that, even though they are often retained from the full study of their feelings.
As he said, Samarians: "I'm the role of listener for people who feel depressed and socidian, he stressed how even the smallest association of friends can benefit."
Often those who are treating us feel that they are not able to speak to friends.
The old teaching "living with this" is strong, as well as the feeling that the open conversation on problems can be understood as weakness.
Friends one of the shows that I'm in mind when I try to propose more continuously working arrangements for overcome.
It stressed the few moments of a man’s friendship.
With regard to my task, the bilateral status of telephones helps people at the time of delay, while long-term support is from the nearby family and friends.
So if you're visiting FriendsFest to Comedy Central in these weekends, where the party has completely restored decorations, why don't you take your friends to drink in Central Perk.
Or better, if you're seeing a single man at Starbucks, smile and say "Privet".
Before not mention the benefits of friendship.
Friends Serial shows the Comdy Central from the beginning and until the end, all 236 series, on the #FriendsFest
De Marie forgets the hole by helping "PSJ" to roll Malma
Anhel de Marie is equal to Blyth Matty and Edison Kabani's murdered stones in the Malmaw gate.
Angel de Marie, debtoring in Liga Championian, killed a hole that lets the Psych easy to shoot Malma's Tuesday.
This is the record of matching and game reaction.
Anhel de Marie and Edinson Kabani did their business when "Sen-Jerman" began their game in Liga Champion with extremely good winning 2:0 against Malmau at the station of Park de Prens on Tuesday.
De Marie lost a mine than four minutes after his first game was started in Liga Championian as a PSJ player to give the Championships to France, but they left a number of opportunities before, finally, increased their advantage when Kabani slaughtered in the 61th minute.
In addition to the "Real Madrid" and the daughter of "Shahter" in the A Group, "Pari" had to start a good game against Sweden Championships because they were not able to qualify triops, but to continue a series of successful games in the last three sessions where they arrived to the four-first.
They were shocked, but it was not the best decision of Loran Blan to read the Zilatan Ibrahimvian in a attack and then replace it in the field against the team of his family city and club, in which he started his close carriage in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or guests in Liga Champion, so to win with account 2:0, to bring to the counterparts problems and to play a good start, even if there are still other moments that we need to work during the season", said Blan.
It's a lot more promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I regret that we didn't lose one or two more.
Ibrahimvich returned after the trauma in one of the replacement of the Paris team, which brought her nobody with account 2:2 in the "Bordo" in the first weekly, but he was in the back of the Di Maria plan for the fourth minute.
The Argentinian attacker noted as a player that could come to new levels in Europe, after he was purchased at the Martin Washington last month, and he proved why he fled from Marco Reratt to protect Malmay and was beautifully completed the attack, sent by Johana Willand's shooting to the round of the door.
But if someone waited for a simple and great victory, it was supposed to be shocked.
"Malma" who wins Seltich in the tribe of Offf to reach this stage, composed of nine world-level games at the beginning of the game, five protectors and two opposite defenders in the middle of the field, was a serious opposer.
But except Nicola Judjich's shooting, with a shooting shooter on the door of Kevin Trapp for the 34th minute, they attacked a little bit.
In time, the " PSJ" pronounced himself by non-resultative transferers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahim, which only in the first half has been able to perform five attempts, and then did not have been able to handle the moon killed by Cabani immediately after the renewing of the game.
However, he showed himself much more clear in the precise passages, and it was a pass from Ibrahim, who was sent by De Maria to a closed shooting shooting that took place in Vienna for 52 minutes.
The second hole was finally forgotten after the time notes by Kawani, the slaughter killed his sixth skin in the season after Ibrahimvich sent a meat sent to the field center from the left band of Maxwell.
This ended all the ideas that were in Malmau about the return to the game, and only the wheat of Viland with a close distance did not allow David Luis to increase the final account before the replacement of Essequiel Lavezy was not read in the most end of the match.
Malme's trainer, Age Harrede, later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, said the Norwegian: "We have been our last game in Championship in December last year."
Since then we played only in Swedish liga, but it's not that level.
Qualification is inadequate.
"Pari" sweetheart!
It was a wonderful shop with them.

Economic news - Nobel Laurea: Globalization
Implementation of globalization processes should contribute to a reduction in the world ' s inequality.
The situation seems to be different, the difference in the income of the population in developing economy, instead, grows.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-educated workers, the primary scientist of the International Analysis Lab and the choice of the NIS, the Nobel Premier for Economy 2007, Mr. Eric Maskin.
In the past twenty years, the world has survived the unexpected growth of global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become more open.
Globalization Parties have predicted great benefits for the development of the economy.
"And these predictions have been a lot", said Maskin.
For example, China and India have received a serious growth in GDP in the population.
But it is not so happy.
It was expected that globalization would reduce the loss of the " minors" and "minor" in poor countries, which are expressed in a large inequality of income, and the exact payment of work.
However, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in its article "When the global markets have not reduced the inequality in developing economies", published in The World Bank Economic Review, which translated and quoted NEE WSE.
In combination with the economic professor of the Harvard University, Michael Cramer Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates the increased difference in income in poor countries while globalization grows.
The new global market has been specific processes.
In order to demonstrate them, Maskin sets four levels of qualification of specialists - A and B for the rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, specialists D from poor countries have no level of qualification to cooperate with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if employees from poor countries have increased payment by cooperating with B staff from the rich, D employees do not feel that their payments fall all over.
A comprehensive effect of internationalization of production will contribute to increased dispersion between two categories of specialists in poor countries and, respectively, increased in equality.
Crimer and E. Machine offered a wonderful beautiful model, an alternative Ricardian theory of comparison.
It will explain why globalization has resulted in income in inequalities,” says Foad Alexandres, a ordinary professor conducting the International Analysis Lab and Selection of Decisions, the Director of the NASMA Mathematic Department.
And as any powerful theory, I'm sure she's going to bring up the empire work in this area.
The problem of Eric Maskin is to increase the level of education of low-capacized workers.
However, as the scientist notes, there is no means for this, but the companies are not able to pay their training.
In such situations, governments, international agencies, NCOs and private funds may play a significant role as a Maskin.
The scientist notes that the developed theory, in any case, does not call for an end of the globalization process that brings and produces its fruit as a GDP growth.

The Green Court was soon slowly disrupting.
typical situation: Four officials are standing before the Court of Justice of the Court of Justice, listening to his recruitment to the work.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We haven't given you a 110-strand order to comfort it, says Kumar.
If there's another cyrpikey, we're going to put all the buildings.
Kumar is a national Green Tribunal (NZT) judicial authority established in 2010 to stop the intense pollution of the environment which is subject to the burning economic growth of the last decades.
At that time, the Tribunal had been able to consider more than 100,000 areas related to air pollution, the collection of museums, geological developments, toxic waste and the construction of the Dam.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the building leading to pollution.
Incredibly high levels: For 60 years since the declaration of the independence of the forced industrial development of India, the women's jongles became one of the most popular and polluted countries of the world.
In particular, the problem is in major megapols where infrastructure is not insured for a delicate urbanization: the city of coating meat, the rivers are filled with pesticides and firms and households, and the rest of the living mass are disrupted under the building of new housing quarters.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the States, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendara Modedi, since it is often the main cause of the cancellation of large investment projects.
Yes, in May of this year, the Minister of Environment called the Court of Extreme and Incomplete.
Sometimes the court decides that it is really impossible to carry out a deadline in the court, and reaffirms the lawyer on environmental matters by the Council of Pandvani.
However, the incomplete dealers have a positive side, and at least they put the responsible persons to be slaughtered.
"It's the main goal to overcome this system," adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has already abolished large buildings several times: the end of the airport, the electricity stations and hundreds of smaller equipment.
In this regard, people are also trying to forget: for example, during the discussion of the pharmaceutical company in the State of Telagna, the polluted area of the fredder River.
We can close your factory, but we answer the economic consequences.
"Their people are losing their job," said Kumar.
However, such explanations do not always have a understanding of simple people who can change their lives through one slaughter.
Similarly, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles for more than 10 years of entering the capital than the general income.
In spite of the extreme popularity and criticism, Svataнтер Kumar refused to reject this decision.
Instead, he stated to the Government of the Deli statistics on the incoming and out of the car carried out, as well as the proposal to purchase 10 000 additional bus, prematurely recognised the manufactures if they could comply with the same order.
As a matter of attention, the court began to deceive the sources of polluting such as calves, the quality of the fuel and even the road incidents, the public wrath began to smile.
But the worst theme of the principle judge was a programme to clean the Gang River, with the abolition of Prime Minister, Nenddroy Modey last year.
When Gang is sacred for the river, the judges often stop to keep their emotions and go to cry.
You know what the word "heilig"?
Someone slaughtered the water from Gang on the statue of God, and there were facelities in it.
You're continuing to pollute the river because you think that Gang is the Gang, he's gonna take all our sins.
This is the river we worship and see what you're doing with her every day.
The cleaning of Gang is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project an anonymous new Government.
Today, the number of factual bacteria in the river exceeds the standard more than 120 times.
A year from 1,5 to 3,7 million of the infections in it have died from infectional diseases.
In February, Narendra Mody had even offered the Gang's Saving Fund for saving money from the sale of his costum, in which he met Barak Obama and 455 other objects from his personal collection.
The ecologs were accused of the polysm prize: the cost of $7,000 was acquired at the time that the river was cleaned needs at least eight billion.
The Green Tribunal members agree that India is going to be a long way before it could be called by a developed country, but they do not believe that the value of progress should be ecological.
" In the developing country, the discussions on the environment are often understood as an unreasonable grow", said the active organization of the "Zoes Gang" Malika Bhannot.
The court is trying to find a golden medium between ecology and development."
