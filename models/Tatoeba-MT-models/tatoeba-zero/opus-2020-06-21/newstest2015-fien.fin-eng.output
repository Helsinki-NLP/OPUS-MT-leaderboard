The ultimate researcher Susan Jordan QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in low and distant areas are likely 20% of women who live in the survey than women in urban areas.
PINIS TUTKIMUS: New medicines may smell the heat and muscle head

The likelihood of survival during the diagnosis was smaller in the age of women and eating.
Women living and distant areas are most likely 20 percent of women who died during the study than women in urban areas.
The survey was not intended to figure out why women outside the towns have a smaller probability of surviving the museums, but Jordan considers that it is possible for a declined diagnosis and a delicate access to treatment.
"Gynecological inquiries are treating this illness best, and their receipt is the largest place in large cities," says Jordan.
While the treatments to be undertaken in the general and the significance of urgency are small, the researcher also suggests the increase in the movement of medicines to ensure that special doctors can be treated nearly in these homes, as well as programs that help to support patients who have been treated far away from home.

The rate of customs is seen in wood-calls
Reducing the number of householders, especially in the group of less than 35 years of age, may lead to decrease trade in the ten million, when young consumers at this day reach their "decimal group". Financial Times reported on the investigation of the Iso-Britannic garden trade link (Original Trades Association, HTA).
According to the Financial Times report, residential crowds are only 55% of the money used for housing.
The survey has also shown that even more people live in extremely urban housing in villages where there are no tree gardens, and there is also a small range of trees when the priests are still cut into parking places, and these factors also threaten the tree garden area, which is estimated by about 5 billion cups in the year.
In London, the ownership of households has been of 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, and there are wooden garden products which are used for the least money in the whole country.
However, the HTA and British wood-care (RHS) reports that increased or reduced housing garden does not mean that people cannot grow vegetables.
Guy Barter's bottle projects say that "for example, the growth of plants in growing plants are specially recommended in the midst of residentiaries, as such increases can be taken, if necessary, in addition".
According to the HTA report, the 1997-2005 revenge rates of wooden garden sector were higher because the ownership and the ability of households increased from the end of the 1980s to the midst of the 1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will be decreased in the result of the better conditions in this year, which is more intensive than the rules of March and April last year.

There were evidence shown by the police and the city government of Calviá on Sunday afternoon of the Chief of Mallorca.
Calviá's Chief of Police in Mallorca has been arrested as a result of the corruption issues presented in the Magalufin region, known as the Magalufi region.

The children of Israel return to school after the war of Gaza
God’s children of the Israelites in all the regions of Gaza were returned to schools at the Sunday in the protection of bombs, when rakets and plots bombed their community 50 days in Israel’s war and Hamas, and the schools remained closed in the battles of the region.
The support of schools was joyful and joyful in the communities of South Israel, but the rest of the battles are still viable.
In the Southern city of Ashdod, in Pashosh Day House, workers removed the following walls and slippers before the children arrived in the kitchen.
"We're a little scared, but we're also grateful," says Ronit Bart, who lives in the name of Saad, the Israeli community, and works as an English teacher in the city school.
Many of the children living in this area have to need rutines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, thinks that the school comes back for a long time is feeling a very strange.
"We have had a difficult time between us, and we didn't go home anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited near Gaza's border in the kibbusse area.
Before the last week, thousands of people of the coastal border communities of Saad had been stayed in the internal locations or from their home to the most safeest regions from Gaza to run from rats and plots.
Many of Nahal Oz communities in the nearby gaza are doubtless in the community of the 4-year-old Palestinian kranats in the community of the 4-year-old son.
According to the Ministry of Education, the right of ten families has not yet returned.
The children of these families have been placed to otherwise in optional schools.
The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, near Gaza’s border, a town that was prestigious for a pregnant Palestinian courtship.
He encouraged the children to study hardly and promised that "to care for children's education and security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to be another powerful fire in the last few days.
The struggle was immediately stopped, but it did not make a solution to many key issues, such as the Hamas requirements for removal of the cities of Israel and Egypt and the reopening of Gaza air and merits.
Israel wants the weapons of Hamas and returns to two wars to the body of the dead of the Israelites.
In Egypt, the start of the new negotiations of non-smooth negotiations will be expected later in this month.
According to the evaluation of Palestinian and the United Nations, more than 2100 Palestinians died in the war, three fourth parts of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has been different of the number of dead, and at least half of the dead were soldiers, although there were no good evidence.
Israel died from 66 soldiers and six citizens, including the Thai employer.
Hamas and other Japanese soldiers shooted 4 591 rakets and kranats to Israeli cities toward the south.
Instead, Israel’s army performed over 50,000 explanations and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Gaza, and estimated that 2500,000 people were flew from the protection of more than 100 UN schools that had been changed in timely protection.
The school authorities continued to be guarded and fighting in tens of people in the beginning of the week ago.
"I hope that the school will be opening soon and coming to school, as well as other children in the world and like the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, 13-year-old in the city of Gaza.
In general, the prices of the carriage have increased over seven years in Australia’s winter months.
In August, the prices of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic in the capital city increased 1.1 per cent of the prices of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic.
The increase of the prices in the summer, July and August period increased over 4,2 per cent, or more than in the same months after 2007.
The annual increase of prices was 10.9%, which is more than two times in the 12 months previous to August 2013, but prices have not been equally increased around the country.
According to Tim Lawless, Sirney and Melbourne's research leader in Data's research manager, the prices are at the head of the prices.
The results of RP Data show that the prices of households in Sydney increased 16.1% and Melbourne 11,7% in the past year.
Adelaes, Brisbane and Darwin’s carriage markets are the most fierce; the average rate of prices is from five to five per cent.
The largest household markets are in Canberra, where prices increased only 1.4 per cent in the year as a result of the Government's spending operations.
According to Lawless, the starts in Australia have increased the number of households in sales in the coming months, which is the real test on the housing market.
"When it takes into account the increase in the sales of carriage, generally low sales and a continuous low rate, it is likely that the prices of the carriage continued to be increased in the next three months", says Lawless.

Lenny Henry says, "My dad never wanted me.
She never said she loved me.
Henry was born from a seven - year - old Jamish family in Dudley, Britain, Midlands, in 1958.
Henry's father worked in the work and died in Henry's 19-year-old age, and his relationship with her son and father was premature.
Henry's best practices the Commediashow of Rudy's Rare Records, which is based on partly with his father to attend a imaginative discussion and developed on the basis of the radio 4 channel series.
The voice is a shock of reggate and rape in the upbeat will.
Henry's got to visit the painful children's memories.
He has often been in therapy after his mother’s death, and she had a lot of relationship with her father.
Dad was very difficult to read.
He never saw his face, just my voice said, "Keep the leg.
Let your sister peace.
Move!
I'm looking at a cricket now.
My parents, Seymour and Hilton, who were alive when I was a child, came in the pub and discussed, for example, the shape of a sweet or the beauty of a cricket.
I never talked to her about such things.
The biggest part of my life, she was me the sweet man in the smell of reading the newspaper.
In Dudley’s silence, Henry opened a metal slaughter and saw what his father’s life had to be, although working conditions today are better than that.
Solution is now a little more lighter, but they are in practice dark, smoke, labyrinthetic depths with smokes, smokes and slightnesses, and they are in the mind of importing.
Dad had the way to go to the village and only the earth in us, and silently he began to sing himself to sing in the smell.
When I walked around, I realized that he had done it for years to buy us in the food table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry’s childhood missed the closeness offered by parents.
My dad never wanted and never said he loved me.
Until my mother began to sickly sick before he died, we started to each other that we love each other.
Henry has a Billie daughter with Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love that she missed as a child.
Is it all the time that I love you, "I love you?"
Stop it now!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend with a French friend who she was married 25 years old.
Dawn's a good man.
Why would Dawn and I not be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons why Mom died.
When I began to suffer a lot of overpression and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
Then I started a lot, and I had also to start a painted diet to reduce the symptoms.
It's very difficult...
And sweet.
Nobody enjoyed eating the sweet.
Henry's known, a short part of the knights is pictured by his change during the emergency development.
A lot of good return from critics can be made to the role of Othleloe he has encouraging the work of the teater.
The following mountains were the Malnuts and August Wilson Fences ("Aidates").
The work of the teater offers a different experience than sitcoms and machines that Henry has done all the urgent time.
Henry started on the field when he was 16-year-old employer.
One shock saw him in imitation and took contact with the New Faces Competition.
Henry's television urge began in the middle of the 70s. "Where long ago I was the only black imitator and comic," he says.
Henry learns to work in the work.
I had to grow growing up in the public light, I had to learn to make sweet sweet from the year 1975 to 1985, as I had been sweet and I was at television.
Lenny New Faces in the Commons in 1975
Henry's manager had sample rights The Black and White Minstrel Show'h, a slight reception program where people appeared to be black, so Henry ended into a set of the program for five years.
My family didn't like that.
On the other hand, I would hope that I would never have participated in it, but I wouldn't lose it.
Although my position was strange and bad, I was able to work in major events and learn how to be treated.
However, "britti-tv rewarded, multi-year favorite and slight swimming program" was the same "comfortable parodes of black people".
Henry worked in the 80s ’ s in the second comedia series in which I made a sleeve and smell of British culture.
The Lenny Henry Show's first part was shown in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known to be shocked in Gareth Blacklock in the comediate chair!
In the next decade, Henry refers to newspapers, documents, TV series and films, but in 2008 I showed LennyHenry.tv after his 2008 series, he said: "What will you like, Len – now it seems that you're just on your place or transportation on your sides."
The next mountain was the radio 4-cana documentation "What's So Great About...?".
In the first part, Shakespeare was treated.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not primarily taught for us in school honor, and I think it belongs to the white medium, which uses soups and has money.
That's why Shakespeare's shock was shocking me.
All of our programs - Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench - said to me: “Cache.
Don't leave the whole idea before you know what you're talking about.
You know why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry expressed 20 pounds of Othlello's last talk for the documentation and she was sold.
I knew I could do this.
I felt that some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put to the place.
"It's the matter, this is important, so take it seriously, teach your sweet, make a small background study.
Thus, the process was tragic, and I read the sample for months before it was done.
Finally, the show was success.
It apparently was expected to be unsuccessful, but it did not.
Shortly afterward, Henry showed the headquarters in the home of the wrongs.
At the same time, I showed the British National Theatre, and I couldn't really believe it.
In one stage, I'm thinking about the thought, "Ooh, you've changed."
Once in the sample, there were technical problems, and Henry clearly felt that he was his task to rejoice the public.
"My little voice in my mind said to me, "You have to stop ten minutes alone until the computer works again."
Instead, the assistant reported that the presentation would be continued immediately when the problem was corrected.
I walked out of the spectacle, and part of me would be shocking.
It's not my responsibilities,
I can leave it to other people to handle.
"You're part of the sample, stay on your role."
Henry "Fences" in Duchess theatre
The teaching of "Fences" for the monastery was an inquiry.
Panic is good. It makes humans more sustainable.
This sample was taken well, so it was like a sign of the gods: "This is what you have to do."
This Henry, of course, says KUMEALLA with a voice.
So I decided to take this place.
I love this job sincerely.
I love practice rooms.
However, Henry is still a comic: the small drought boys continue to stop our discussion when he changed on his imitation to another.
The arrest of the stand-up committee is a matter of willingness, since the receipt of immediate thanks to the unknown generality affects dangerous effects.
If you continue to smell it, it can lead to the smells.
Sometimes I'll take a lot of time with the Apollo theatre when it feels like it, but in general, it's not going to be intriguing me in the same way as before.
I'm asking Henry if he's going to go to the new stand-up.
I have a real joy to sit together with a guide that helps to edit the whole journey at the beginning, in the middle and end of the journey, and I don't believe that I would never want to get away from that feeling.
So this is his new resurrection?
I think so.
I like showing...
It's really fun.
The show continues to tell the story, and it is a rejoicing task.
I love the story.
People love the story.
Kenia has prepared registers from the officials to remove the "fabrics"
Kenya has started to record a biometric register of officials by trying to remove the "fabric" factors from the government's paylist.
Employers who have not been reported to the register for the next two weeks have not been paid, and notified by the government in the report.
The government doubts that thousands are still paid for their abandoned officers.
President Uhuru Kenyata promised the complaint of the public sector when the office was established in 2013.
According to the revised last year, the payment of the "commercies" and the other economic infringements has paid at least a million dollars per month.
The government suspects that payments are paid to the payment after a person died or left his official office, BBC Wanyama Chebusiri reports about the capital of Nairobi.
All officers should notify themselves during the following weeks in the identification centres to ensure that their information is stored in the biometric registering format, reported by the Government in the information.
According to the information, all those who leave this act without the appropriate reason shall be removed from the payment list.
"This measures are significantly reasoned for the public sector, since this defines how many of the spirits really operate in the tasks, and there is also a cleaning list at both levels of the government, and so solved the issue of the "fabrics", says Anne Waigru, the official of the cabinet of the Ministry for Disarmament and Planning.
In June 2015, the result of the accounting period may remain a decrease of EUR 25.5 million, unless the city agrees to its activities and its expenditure in the economic situation.
Based on the budgetary process, the year is remaining at about 9,4 million.
In the events of efficiency, there was a view to the extensive and level of services, as well as purchase, purchase and aid, and increased tax and payment products.
The 10 million euros in the investment target is 8.5 million.
The situation of the complaints is not allowed.
The new obligations set to the Lord, the unsuccessful growth of taxes, the increased unemployment and the transaction of the five per cent of the state income are decreased.
The economic seminar aims to search for new means for the balance of the economy.
Trade management is unilateral to ensure that the expenditure must be available.
The ship must be translated to the objective of the strategy, and the president of the city government is chaired by Kimmo Heinone.
Trade management was still prepared for the leading group.
The proposals for trade management are based on budgetary preparation in the budgetary seminars of the State in Framework on Wednesday, 8 September.
After the delegation seminar, the budget proposal will be advanced by means of the shipping process to the city government and to the city department.
Decades of Turkish fleet police were arrested as suspected against the "good" government
All 33 police have been arrested in Turkey as a suspect of "being against government", local media sources are reported.
Police authorities did not comment immediately.
According to the Daily News Journal, the arrested team had 14 high-quality police officers.
Some of the police were linked to the corruption studies of last December, with the aim of the officials of the government, for example, four ministers of governments.
In July, a number of police arrested in Turkey on the organization and monitoring of telephones.
The President of Turkey Recep Tayip Erdogan, who was the Prime Minister in that period, said that the police was part of the planned action against him and other authorities.
All children don't return to school in Ukraine
Most of the Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Sunday (1 September).
This is traditionally important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian elderly, the Prime Minister, Arseny Yatsenyuk, also took her daughter to school.
He then told expected providers that all schools have not reopened again, but he said he had committed to defend the country for future generations:
The first day of the girl was not carried out in each school.
Everything in Ukraine does not rule peace.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole Ukrainians, the great Ukrainians, have to fight for peace.
Alexandra Pastukhov, who works as a teacher at the Slaviansk School where the daughter of Yatsenyuk, spoke as Russian.
We hope that peace will return here finally and that children can get a learning of them in the future.
Traditionally, in the first school day celebrations includes paths, airballs, and flowers to teachers.
According to Texas Perry, the shocking Twitter was a license.
From the Twitter account for the Texas Secretary Rick Perry, Sunday nights, a defense from the democratic designer of the Democratics was sent to this hearing.
The twitter was then removed, and it followed a new twitter in which Perry sweared that he had nothing to do with a picture.
The twitter was sent out of my account unpromissablely.
“I'm not accepting the twitter and I've removed it,” the later publication was said.
Perry's background teams did not immediately respond to the requests for clarification.
Although the Twitters were sent by Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it's doubtless who published your image.
The first Twitter was the designer of the travis, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to the rating contract in April 2013.
Perry is the financing of Lehmberg's Lehmberg office when it refused to disappear, which resulted in the meeting of a great candidate in Austin in Perry in this month. Perry is the possibility of the presidential elections in 2016.
The title of the Tweet was: "I'm not always starting in the humal, three times allowed in the biggest snakes... but when that happens, I'm accusing Mr. Perry to show the shine."
I'm Texas's humble democracy.
The Lehmberg Agency did not conduct a large investigation against Perry.
The investigation conducted Michael McCrum, San Antiony, the specialist whose mission was assigned by the Republic of the Republic.
Perry has said it's not guilty, and he has called defences to be politically sweet.
His effective judicial appeal has requested the judge to reject accusedness and said that the law which has been accused of the former officials of Texas is a questionnaire infringement against the Constitution.
Perry operated 7.5 million dollars of the State to support the government's public insurance unit that operates in the Travis area and to handle the decisions of the public sector when Lehmberg refused to disappear.
Perry's decision was taken to the left the follow-up group to give an official complaint on the matter.
Perry's confirmed Twitter accounts will be regularly updated – and sometimes well-known.
At the fiveth meeting of Iowan, during his presidential meeting in 2012, Perry threatened to stop the game by published a picture on Twitter on its own floor on the shooting shore of the "This will come, South-Carol!" round.
Berkeley says that household markets are again "normal"
One of the main constructors in London has warned that the Employees of Caicois-English markets have "paved" to normal activity.
The capital city in London has experienced a huge question and a wide price increase at the same time that has been scared of the wide expansion of the credit bag, which has resulted in the establishment of limited households in June.
On Monday, a high-builder of Berkeley and President Tony Pidgley said that "the number of markets and trades since the beginning of the financial year have been normally returned after 2013" and added that this has been possible for "unless an operational environment".
In London’s accommodation market, foreign investors were able to spend in the capital city.
According to the reports, the prices in the city increased only 18.5 per cent only in the past year and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6,7 per cent.
At the end of April, the average sales of private, attractive and student buildings in Berkeley increased about five years ago, reaching 423,000 feet.
However, the confirmed point has been made in London in the last few months of the less attractive point - part of the interests of the counterparty has also affected new income taxes and political restrictions in the possible "cartanover" before May.
In the past week, the London counterparty Foxtons warned that the household report, in which the more strict rules were reported, would lead to the level of market growth and the market sales and prices in the second half of the year.
In July, the imported information of the Bank indicated that the amount of the accepted legislation was reduced, which refers to the domestic market in July.
Another counterparty Hamptons International has calculated its 2015 prediction on the prices of loans in London, and according to that the prices are calculated by 3 per cent, as the view of the residential names has already been deteriorate.
The number of trades in London in the most largest regions in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has been cut into the fourth year following the firm interface WA Elis.
However, in the capital, there is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased the income of sales for more than 2,2 billion.
Pidgley adds that “the question of the right product has remained stable in the best places, and thus the sale has remained stable”.
In June, the company reported its sales to 3 742 new homes in April, which is nearly a third of the period of the financial crisis in 2007.
Annual profits were increased by 40 per cent over the year, so 380 million punks and trade change increased by 18 per cent of 1,6 billion.
Pidgley reported on Monday before the company's Year Meeting, that the Barkeley's current market expectations are corresponding to the current expectations.
Analytics agree that the overwhelming profit of the year is 450 million pounds.
Berkeley's share was sold on Wednesday at London's pool at 23.96 pounds.
Hakeri took the videos of Jennifer Lawrence on the internet
Jennifer Lawrence arrived in the 85th year of the Academy Awards.
The Hacker, who claims to be able to control in hundreds other ways, had the pictures of Oscar's shower, Jennifer Lawrence.
The representative of the Hunger Game confirmed that the images are the truths and the judge of Hacker 'the rare injury of the privacy'.
It has been connected to the authorities, and all those who publish the images of Jennifer Lawrence will be sentenced.
Images that first were published at the 4chan image page, apparently ended in wrong hands because of the weakness of Apple iCloud storage system. I find out the list of other haqueroids, as a result, claimed to be ten other women, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashia, Mary Elizabeth Winstett and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
We don't know how many pictures are, indeed Scott Pilgrim against the World Star Winstead judged a haqueroin on Twitter.
"To those who look at me and my husband at our home in private years ago: hopefully you have a good mind," you tweeted.
But Victoria Justice's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series, however, denounced photos of truth and tweet that "these so-called pictures of me are not understood."
Let me make this end right now.
BuzzFeed reported late Sunday that the representative of Ariana Grande was the language of the images about the star.
Only we're shown about Howard Jacobson's gratitude for a new Roman that tells us about love and j literature
They smelled, they described the best events, at least they cut off from each other than the bad box left out.
Only then she heard about the woman that it was too serious, difficult, intensive, cut off, and maybe a little bit sweet.
Then he shocked her hands.
He's shocked.
Yeah, she was a shirt like a shirt.
His last sacrifice was at the beginning of a relationship that had been promised; it was shown that this relationship would have been to facilitate his unique stupidity, and it may have brought his life even some content.
Ailin Solomon had untenable hair, and he was a slightly beautiful heart with joyful heart, the northern village that was still more sweet and far away than Port Reuben.
He came to the south of a parent journey partner, Kevern, whose teacher was his teacher, and he was here with a house that was placed in the place of the Paradise Valley, and the name of the lake was appropriately the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the field for a year.
The pools were born, all in the village rooms were shocked, the etans left their posts in their own place, the wooden garden grew in rich foods that remembered waste cattles.
The bottle was like the harvest of children, at the same time a threatful and magnificent wood garden filled with secrets.
The writer reported: Howard Jacobson, whose Roman "J" is the condition of receiving booker library in 2014.
Proposals to be published in the next week
Kevern was sit in the hand with Ayinn in the long-term tears of a long-term hot night, the surprising solar night, both devastating receipt, which the whole country heard to be satisfied with music and calm news when Ailin's crossings, the swimming feet of the sun took a song of the mind of Kevern that had been forgotten for a long time and that his father had often been swearing music.
Your feet is too big.
Such songs were promptly too aggressive, and they were no longer played in receipt.
They have not been banned - nothing, especially nothing has been prohibited - they have no longer been called.
They wanted to leave their memory, like the word itself forget.
The general view has been achieved by what was not made in the laws and in the proclamation: as the literal columns of people chose to read the memories of the heroes, the letters and the Romans, they also recommend ballasts for music.
When Kevern was a day-to-day switch, he began to sing a imaginative plan and sing the Serenadia Ailin's big feet with a slight voice.
I didn't understand.
"It was a Japanese song known by Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and in the same way, he put two fingers in front of his mouth.
I saw her dad always did before the "j" book was cut off his mouth.
It was started as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father told him that he had played the same game with his own father.
If you left your mouth with a word that starts, and you didn't remember to smell two fingers before your mouth, you should pay a pen.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't now.
He knew that it was waiting for him. That's all.
He had to explain what Jazz is.
I've never heard that.
Japan has not been declared primarily for bans, not only called.
Improvisation was no longer in mode.
Life was a place for one word.
At the beginning of the song, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
I've been in the same way.
The unforeseenness of the people was nervous.
And Jazz was also a musical exhibition.
Although Kevern hasn't been a 10 years old, Sammy Davis Junior, the jazz music had come to meet him through his father's midst CD school.
Well, at least she didn't have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
In view of the age of Ailin, he did not remember time when the recommended songs were not black.
There's no laws needed, no packing.
The earliest society intended that each of its parts were grateful — thankful — for they were as a good business — a principle that, according to each group, had done confidence to them.
Based on their temperature and physic characteristics, the African-Caribian sex juveniles agree to engage and sport the best, so they sing and drink.
The first part of the Indian country was as naturally as giftable with electrical devices, so their task was to ensure that each family had an operational phone used to handle matters.
Those who remained in the mid-term community worked as a smuggle; the last Greeks ruined the wheels.
When SE, TAPAHTUI, JOS TAPAHTUI, the Persians and South India homes were whose grandmothers hadn't flewn in fear of their condemnation and fear that they would like to be the following, open restaurants offering the labneh joggart and burned water powder, and continued their lives as a land creating and tyrity country.
Everyone shall work according to his gifts.
Ailin had only heard ballasts, and she was difficult to understand how the blessed words of Kevern had never been able to smell music.
The music also expressed love.
"They aren't really injured," Kevern said.
And maybe it's just what the shooters think.
My dad never blessed anyone, but this song was happy.
She had already said too much, but the abandoned garden made an illusion safe.
Any word would not be passed through the sounding of the deceased carcasses newspapers.
But I didn't understand.
Why did your dad love something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to smell two fingers with Ailin.
You know, I've got him out of here now.
"It was the father's thinking to smile," he said instead.
Ailin's smiling headed as an incredible, and his hair slaughtered the view of Kevern.
There is nothing else to see in the whole world than the powerful, variety of the hair of the Ailin.
There's nothing else he didn't want to see.
"If you say so once," he said not to hear about convincing.
But it doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
The Ailin seemed to have been a age shocked.
Is my feet so big?
He looked back.
You don't really have your feet great.
Your skin, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my nickel's too packed?
I hate you?
Of course I'm not hating you.
It was just a stupid song.
She could have said, "I love you," but it was still too long.
"You're going to smell me because of your swings," he tried to correct the situation.
I'm in the mind of it.
This wasn't helpful.
She wanted to hear it's like a fun.
Often, when he wanted to rejoice, the effect was very different because he, as well as his father, missed the charm that can dominate the publicity of the wrath.
Maybe his dad was intended to be a murder.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Notwithstanding the slight eyes.
Ailin Solomon rose and slept in the tent and slaughtered the wine that they had just drinked.
The wine was only made of shocks, so he couldn't use it as a reason for the shooting.
In his nervousity, he seemed to be shocked like a palm ball in a shock.
"And your head is what I'm roundly smiling in you," he said...
I don't feel like that.
Kevern was sorry for Ailin, as well as because of his own unnecessary words, as well as of the fear that saw in this sight at the time that Ailin decided to shoot him.
Did Ailin think he'd find him?
He had never told Kevern about the life in the northern island where he had grown, but Kevern was certain that the normally it was the same as the life here.
The same magnificent, good sea that stripped against them.
Similarly, after TAPAHTON, the men were still more shocked and smelling than their shuttlers and parents, walking from the pub to the pub, prepared to shoot every woman who would shoot against or blame them.
He's the head?
He's still seeing a smooth, if he'd be careful!
First, the smell — the smell of a common man and a woman’s disappearing word was a descriptive word; the reciprocal reaction of loving ballets that were unpopulated — was first shoot and then attacked.
Kevern believed that it was too much, because it was already encouraging himself.
Ailin Solomon's body language called him to leave.
He took himself up to the snake as a old man.
Ailin also felt smiling, but Kevern's pain was surprised to her.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They probably lost their feelings each other.
Ailin followed his spending — like his travel partner watched Kevern’s expense from the upper window — a man who was very reasonable for his life of pregnancy.
Let me get out of the garden, he thought.
He was aware of the regret against Kevern and men in general, even though a part of them had leaned his hands against him to attack him.
His shock tradued, shocked, shocked man who had lost all the struggle — why did he feel that the vision was so known to him, although he did not remember that once before this moment was seen the moon?
When Ailin Solomon was alone, he looked at his legs.
A few years ago, an intelligent and innocent 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in the private institution in Ofnow, made a short and medium-sized investigation on the country where violence reduction, or decreasing, a small and medium-scale investigation was likely taking into account the money and energy used for it.
"He has already been done, and much has yet been done," he wrote, "to limit thousands of years of battle and most of the victory people, especially in the abandoned and discriminated tricks where, despite the overwhelming conflicts of thoughts, human weakness has been well known.
Some things, however, can't be able to remove all of them.
Whatever the higher tower, the lower ones are the thoughts that they have generated.
The nation smile in the spouse of sentimental ballads, the opposite stories and sweet in the name of the good names of marriage and family life, but the same prisoner accused of being unpleasant to take into account both land communities and urban communities, and there are also evidence of the new, unfamiliar racing in homes, workplaces, streets and even in the playshops.
"You have to choose a tendency to dramatize", his leader commented by reading the whole report.
I would propose you read less Romans.
Esme Nussbaum was looking at the ground.
In addition, I have to ask you if you're an atheist?
"I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you lesbos?
The scene continued to be the right of not responding to personal questions.
Feminists?
Again, silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "I am opposed to atheism, lesbossuality and feminism.
In this place of work, no precautions are surprised.
We are unpredictable social servants.
Although a certain superiority is fully acceptable and respectful to you, it may sometimes lead to false final results, as you just shown to me.
Indeed, you have something against the church – and what you call to be magnificent or malicious, the other are generally a creative for energy and physical strength.
WHEN TAPAHTUI, JOS TAPAHTUI, as it would have happened last night, if it happened, it will destroy the substantial body of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around at Rabinowitz.
In the back of Rabinowitz's head, a flamingon-flamingon-rood LED declared the guideline that Ofnow had shared to the country for the fourth or longer years.
Small your neighbor, worth your partner, listen to ballades, go in musical, use your phone, discuss, explain, listen, be the same, please forgive.
Speaking is better than silence and sing word is better than written, but nothing can love.
"I understand well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum answered with a silent voice when I was sure that his leader had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not the same effectively improved as we thought it is.
I am worried that if we don't warn us, we will reiterate the same errors that, first of all, have resulted in SIIHEN, TAPAHTUI, JOS TAPAHTUI.
This time, we do not, however, cost our hate and our incrédibility to others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid.
That means the end of patientity.
"I'm too long," he said, "in your pictures 'fakes' the works that our grandfather could have done or be done.
You're also going too long when you say that they're able to enable their hatred and their incrédibility to others."
It should not be remembered that when it is about understanding of the past, or defence of the modernity, we don't speak about 'We' or 't'.
There was nothing of 'noise' or 'noise'.
It was the time of caos, that's all we know about it.
"If we are very honest, there is a cake," Esme shocked to continue, "a group of society cannot say what they did well.
I'm not a reason for anyone.
What I did, it was good or bad.
That's the time.
We don't need to talk more -- we agree with this.
And as it is necessary to share defences, there is no need to be justified, then they were subjective or not, and even if somebody could do it.
But for what is the past, then, if you don't get it to learn--
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing...
Luther Rabinowitz struggled his pyramid.
"I go through your report," he said and expressed that Esmen was time to go.
On the next day, when he passed to work, normally part of him of a swimming motor driver whose time the drivers were described "fatal and raised".
It's the skins.
Leotho's army refuses its plans of attack; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Leotho’s army officers have refused the attack intended to be shocked by their government and said that they work against the police whose doubts tried to weaken political fanats.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country, saying that the army had designed his official house and ruled the government buildings in the capital of Maser.
The Head of State traveled with his family to the neighborhood of South Africa after telling us that there was a death disease.
Army representative Major Ntlele Ntoi said that the army answered the threat that was from the "political fanatics". The police was said to be weakening fanats.
"The Defence Forces Lesoto has taken a number of information on which some police forces try to wake up young party fans as they were prepared to cause problems," he reported to the Voice of America News Office.
According to Clayson Monyela, the speaker of the South African government, military action showed a revolutionary company.
"In any case no body has claimed to be a powerful government, the Defence Forces Leotho shows the signs of the corresponding revolution company," he says.
According to Leotho’s army officers, the soldiers return to their army on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful tunnel.
For this means, the Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing is leading to the government from Thaban.
Thabane says that it's an action, because he has tried to fight corruption.
Since June, Thabane has suspended the meetings of the committee because of the dignity of the Government of Coalition.
He denied the government's power, although otherwise claims.
Trade Journal: Microsoft builds the database for New Palette
Microsoft Information Technology Enterprise has established a large database centre to a new place where the company has not agreed to check.
In the information sent to Microsoft media, the company notes that it does not contain any position in its databases on security reasons.
According to Microsoft, the debate is already completely warned and able to be online.
It's an investment of hundreds of millions of dollars to Microsoft.
In the public, there was an extensive place in which Opulu or Caia was slaughtered.
Microsoft stops completely with its school feature, which leads to some 500 people from the workplace.
In all, Microsoft has reported its outstanding news in Finland at least 1 050 jobs.
The President of the Microsoft Communication Camilla Lindfors says to STT that the company does not comment how much staff is to work in the new database center.
The establishment of the database for the New Temple reported the Trade Journal on Monday.
Man is accused of a girl's summary in the trade rate
78-year-old man is accused of a three-year-old girl in Fif.
Gordon Stewart is accused of thinking about a girl in the struggle in Pittenween, east of Neuk.
Successors say that Stewart was driving Audi Q3 with a car uncertainty and caused the girl’s weakness.
Stewart, from the Anstruther home, 78, prohibited the accused of the Dundee sheriff's meeting.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC decided to start the court in January.
Four exhibits to the best pictures and videos of the waterlands
If you want to take pictures or videos under water, you have to choose several different devices.
The option for the Predulls is water-conditioning, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both paying around $300.
Indeed, I took these pictures at the family party using several different rooms, each amounted to less than $350.
Independence on the device, there are some rules that are supported.
Check your device for two times.
Even though you have a water camera, make sure that the camera's machine and the other parts have been closed with water.
In addition, set the camera image settings to respond to captive pictures or videos.
Some of the cameras or cameras are combined with a regulation that makes it possible to optimize descriptive solutions under the water.
Furthermore, before you hip into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras have only 5 ways deep, others even 50-60 ways deep.
Reconciliation for both general and water models in our shopping and digit cameras.
Take several pictures — many of them are in a manner.
The compact chambers have a LCD display that can adjust images when again in the action cameras are not frequently like this.
Although you have LCD, it is difficult to see under the water, and the switch of the image may be successful or unsuccessful.
So take a few pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows the furniture, which means taking several pictures once again with different sets, use this property.
Stay close to the edge.
The light is significantly reduced by deeply.
If possible, stay closely near the surface in your images at the bottom, in the sea or in the sea.
This is how you can imagine more colors; the more deeply you go, the less colors appear.
Try to get close to the descriptive item.
This is an important counsel in the country, but still more important under the water, since light conditions are slow.
It is very important when you have an action camera: these devices are often frozen lines with a wide image grade, or the imager must be close to the item to fill the entire images later.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose his leaders – Intelligence claims costs
The Chinese Parliament decided Sunday that Hong Kong's voters should not be able to select candidates for growing, democratic reforms, in spite of the peacelessness required by the Hungarian voters in 2017.
The decision is likely to give a tremendous card of the Hongkong trade world, which has been planned and implemented only after the publication of the decision.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress gives the Communist's power to remove all candidates that do not obey Peking in practice.
"This was expectable, but it's still raised," says the President of the Democratic Party, lawyer Emily Lau.
This isn't what Peking promised.
They're lying to the Hungarians.
It is clear that we are working with self-employed administration.
The chief Le Fei of the Chinese People's Congress Committee defended China's government, saying that a common candidate for the election of Hongkong's leader would be too "eighty".
Since 1997, since Iso-Britannia, Hong Kong to China, the Peking authorized the people of the region that it would be chosen by its leader by 2017.
According to the Chinese leaders, the decision on Sunday was a democratic interference because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in large sights, but it also clearly makes that China wants to strictly control the sight process through the appointment committee of Peking.
According to the new statement, only the candidates that " love the land and love Hong Kong," are accepted.
In the past summer, the decision was organized in Hong Kong on the majority of some regions and the main attention of the higher protests in the years.
A large part of the Occupy Central With Love and Peace campaign, which organized organizers have intended to prevent the work of the commercial world, if Peking did not grant true vocational rights to Hong Kong.
On Sunday, only after the publication of a decision, hundreds of Occupy Central movements gathered together in front of the main government structures of Hong Kong.
In the considerational address, the organizations reported the movement at the time of the new citizen inadequacy and took the protesting vessels in the coming weeks.
However, they have not apparently reported details that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In its information published in the network, the organizations said that the trade "deserves the Occupy Central as the last way to be used if there is no hope of dialogue and no other way".
We are very regretted to say that today the last possibility of dialogue has been corrupted and the control of the central will be happening.
The Hungary authorities have been prepared for the Peking report for days, and the Sunday security measures were strict near the main structures of the government.
In Hong Kong, in peacelessness, many felt that the people are quietly losing their city of power.
Competitiveness of products and services has been caused by mantere flows.
Furthermore, the fear of Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and vocabulary freedom, is to disappear the growing pressure of Peking.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central Law, because it threatens the Hong Kong’s body — the commercial world.
"Proteest which they speak may lead to the largest economic losses, depending on how many of it take part and how long it is to dump", says the legislator Regina Ip, who has been worthy for a long time.
We don't want to wipe out that Hong Kong's got out of our hair.
This image would be bad to invest.
The Chinese state media also has stories which indicate that Hong Kong's democracy activists are the maintenance of the rural governments of disabled democracy."
In the summer, activists organized an unofficient votes regulation, which participated by 780.000 people — over five voters of Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in the majority of democracy in the region.
The university of the United States's prom tradition attacks the UK University: new students privacy records
We are inspired to ask us through the basis of the first shipping form of British shipping to students this day.
In addition to the private machine, the company also provides other vehicles such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure that the university can be reached at the university as possible.
Stewart says that there is also a security view in the service.
Service is the best option for students who, on the other hand, financed their ownership of the land in their cars in later cars.
When this is combined with many VIF properties (VIPs), we are willing to provide the most possible help and high-class transport university to students today.

There are also translators, families and trainers in Birba, but there are also fans.
And there's a lot of them.
The appearance has grown to unconscious relationships.
Nobody will probably be able to say to check the number of Finnish investigations.
The estimates have moved between 7 500-10 000.
There was a number of things between that, it's absolutely unconscious.
This is the explanation of sports.
In the global economy, enterprises move over the borders.
The sport has still a chance to consider how we are internationally going.
When we increased movement, we can see how our girls and sons are successful in the world, says Professor Hannu Itkon of the Association.
Indeed, both in Spain and in Poland there are Finnish people who are looking for lives.
A combination of experiences.
But it's not all that explains.
In the sports, it must also be shocked.
I've been able to increase the sport as parts of the popular culture.
It's less skin to go to sports than to look at the art in Berlin.
But without success, the mass can't be moved.
Let's go back to 1995.
Then, Chairman Dettmann deceived the counterparty and also the players to shut up with the high-speed professionally.
It's about ten years after it.
Then the direction changed and the team operation was raised to the feet.
The aircraft did the same move for a while before.
Now both enjoyed the work of fruit.
As it says, both species have been able to produce their high-sport where holy thirdness works: sports media sponsors.
Then it's also interested in the public.
And the media has taught what such a carne-electric support is, Ikone remembers.
Can pillars be able to move this massive interest in home series?
In the cori and aircraft, you can play a average of hundreds or a few more than thousands of viewers.
I have to ask a question as good, and I will not necessarily give answers that would promise very good kinds.
The second school believes that interest is going to pass.
Another one is the one who doesn't want to make the land perfect.
This village is ready to live in MMs, but in their foundation, the series are not twice interested in their home discussion.
That's the challenge of the followers in the midst of the drug.

Fixing way to regulate in the books
The costs of college books in the United States exceed $1,000 for many students, so soon Matt Schroeder will start a second year of study to discover the flexibility way to regulate the costs.
He developed a system in which students of the past year courses put their letters on a named reimbursement instead of sending books on the same way.
"My mathematic book would normally have paid $180; I estimated the use of it for $10 for the whole year, and I'd be able to win the aid", says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studys the Covenant College in Georgia State.
Schroeder reports that his last few years’ book would normally pay $430.
Instead, he used them $ 120.
According to the Directorate-General, the average student uses more than $1,200 per year for educational and educational requirements, but students are available to reduce these costs.
Students still end up to use network trades and approaches like Schroeder’s idea.
A few more students have a book of learning books in which they can use a book for all the years and pay it clearly less than buying students.
According to Nebo Inc, more than 250 camping booking undertakings have doubled from 2011.
Statistics on the area show that about the fourth universities' booking of bookshops was a skin, President Trevor Meyer, reports.
According to the National Association of College Stors, at least half of all writings are obtained from the bookshops of camps.
This is the simplest way to resolve the clear money.
Network Trade
The new book in the networks can only be obtained from the third part of what it would pay for the campsite bookshop.
The recommendation price of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book is almost $290, but the networking of special letters for Chegg.com is $239.99.
Search when used
The books used are a good option if readers do not interfere with other memory and consumed outside.
For example, the Calculus book is used by the Chegg.com network for $93.49.
Brigham Young University's last year student Matt Casaday, 25 years, tells his book "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business" by Amazon.com network sale only $0.42.
The new book would have paid $48.
Massachusetts University of Amherst's College Without Walls, director Ingrid Bracey and other academics recommend that students ask their teacher whether they can use previous pressures in courses.
Sometimes the reforms of the new weight are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the weight can only be found in the part of the skin that should be paid again.
Besides Chegg and Amazon bookshops, eBay Inc's Half.com is recommended for buying the books used.
Yearing
If you take care of them, you remember returning them and you don’t need them to do so.
You can fix more than 80% of the new book's hair.
For example, the explanation of the Calculus book for the whole number of years pays about 20 dollars.
Reconciliation with the rules of the firm on the basis of recording, highlighting the use of aid and the consumption of the following payments.
Year, you're sure: if you forgot to return the book, the late expenditure may be greater than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
The acquisition of e-mail books instead of normal papers may also be a question.
Sometimes these books will be covered by paying e-book rights to its holder, such as Amazon.com-, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc bookshops.
Chegg's trade is e-mail of Calculus for six months for about 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, many readiness students are mostly regulated, since several classics can now be loaded freely when the books in science and technological areas can be very expensive.
The comparison of various sales supports what option then is chosen.
Joe Gault, 29 who will immediately start in the Pepperd Jurisprudence, recommends to use a good book for the finding of the prices, as it can make sure that it is looking for the right book.
Before you're at the internet, make sure that your book is in the store, Gault says.
He himself learns through this shooting head.
His book was delivered in four weeks, and finally he was going to buy a full price from the University’s Library Trade.

The city government of Tampere is talking about the matter today.
Animal hopes that the government of the city will be able to support the initiative.
According to Salla Judgmentwala, the Director of Animal Operation, University of Tampere, the Court of Justice, in Finland and the world's entire end has been slightly completed.
In recent years, the world has been happy to see that the weight of the defensors of defensors such as delphine is not animally and nonethicly sustainable.
I would hope that this view would also be condemned to Tampere.
The lack of the Delphineary is not only animal rights, but also the question of Tampere’s imagination as a tourist point, is noted.
According to the Court of Justice, the death of the see-delphin is confirmed by the subsequent dufinary activity.
I see the death is painful to continue in the deep history of the Deep Delphinary.
It is time to put rise to the dead, close the delphine prison and start to find out how Tampere delphines can be moved to the bordered sea area, a certain defence home of the delphine, requires a judge.
This has not been able to experience back to the original life environment of delphine, but hopefully the final ends in the Sri Lantern have been able to experience other lives than the uncomfortable betonair, the Hope.
The Animal Protection Association aims to prohibit the use of all wild animals in the circles of the animal protection system in the general reform.
The defense will also be read to this group.
The support of the provision by the Director of the Office of the Animal Court is involved today in the organizational exhibition for the delphine.
In the largest of the Japanese division in Helsinki, it is a view to the starting delphine forest in Japan.
During the forestry, it is arrested or murdered annually by about 2300 delphines, either for use or food of defenders.
The Put requires for the opening of negotiations with Eastern Ukraine
The Russian President Vladimir Put requires Sunday that the Ukrainian government stops combating separators in the Eastern country and immediately initiates negotiations on the "statute", Russian news sources.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Put did not mean that separaters of the Eastern Ukraine would be part of Russia, but that its position in Ukraine should be re-assessed to enable the population of Russia to defend their own rights and attractions.
I put the request for negotiations to the Kyowa Government as a balanced partner of Russian rebellious negotiations to respond to his clear strategy, which he has followed until five years ago the violence has started: he is trying to help separaters in the region and thus to force Ukrainian government to grant an extensive proclaimed Novorossian self-intelligence instead of Russia.
In the discussion of the Canadian Kana 1-tv, Put condemned the Ukrainian armies to return to the West Donetsk and Luhansk region whose separators had powered the maritime and April, the Ukrainian Criminal Crime to be called on themselves on March 18th.
Kreml and separators are quietly looking for the region as "Novoros," "Novoise as Russia" – this term reminds the days of the Bureau of Russia's great revolutions.
According to the Russian news office Itar-Tass, Put said that the planned peace negotiations are "life" as long as the Ukrainian politicians will carry out parliamentary campaigns on 26 October and the government forces will attack civilians in the areas dominated by separatities.
"We have to begin immediately broad negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the organization of society and on the position of the State of Caicos-Ukrainian, and thus take into account the intresss of the people living there", says he.
According to the fact that the reference of Putin to "Stateness" is an increased self-respect, which has been discussed over months with Kyovan's leadership in trying to strive the fears of the Russian language regions to be threatened by their cultural and language rights.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant self-relatedness to the Western regions, said Peskov.
This is not possible for discussions between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says: "If there is no conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but the internal conflict of Ukraine."
The interdependence of the representative of Kreml, which was intended to correct the comments of Putin's "fault interpretation", stressed that Russian government was treated in the different ways of the separation of the Eastern regions than the Crime, which, in practice, is considered to be the region of which the majority of two million people are particularly Russian.
Moscow would be significantly more difficult to associate himself even Donetsk or Luansk regions in Eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6,5 million people living in the region are not particularly Russians, and since the disappointment of conflicts in the majority of the population has supported remaining in Ukraine.
The identity of Russian diplomates focused on international fosters would enable Ukrainian local governments to agree on their own trade agreements and on their external relations, which would allow Kreml to be in practice in the region of the power that combines Russian Krim.
The Russian headship is located five months ago in the neighborhood of the sea, as well as in the slopes of the sea, and in the historic beach items.
The region between Russian Rostov and Crime also has cows, manufactures and metal waste that produce vital products for the Russian army.
In its official appointment on 7 June, the President of Ukraine proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, after new laws, consider the constitutional changes in order to add the resolutions of the regions that are excluded from the Ukrainian nuclear region of their own economic and language position.
However, his vision of self-respect seems to be deeply different from the views of the weapons and licensed separations of Kreml and Moscow.
In the last week, as a partner of Russian tanks and troops in Eastern Ukraine before the peaceful region of the Azovine Sea, I proposed, by the government of whom I had presented its latest requirements.
The Ukrainian security authorities are afraid that the detention of the separation of Russian supported by Novoazovsk is the start of a greater effort to enable the whole strategicly significant beach area to Crime.
It has led to the massive civil and military personnel to strengthen the city of Mariupoli. Mariupol, Poland, is known as a portion city that is located between the capital of Novoazovsk and Crime.
On Saturday, he spoke to the leaders of the European Union on Saturday, in Brussels and in the former Republic of the Soviet Union that had been self-employed by Russia for 23 years.
"We'll get back to the point that's not returned." Boohhenko warned.
There are now thousands of visiting soldiers and tanks in the Ukraine region.
The EU Headquarters did not have direct decisions on action; the leaders presented the development of additional sanctions, so that they could be used if the Ukrainian crisis was re-interrupted in uncertain conditions.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to fulfil their arms in the Little region of two Russian panzers and 1,000 military transferred last week to the Donetsk region to confirm the difficulty of the separators, General Andriy Lysenko, the representative of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine, reported to the providers on Sunday.
According to Lysenko, the first Russian preaching in Liveisk, 63 Ukrainian soldiers had been changed into 10 Russian shoes who were arrested in the Ukrainian region a week ago.
