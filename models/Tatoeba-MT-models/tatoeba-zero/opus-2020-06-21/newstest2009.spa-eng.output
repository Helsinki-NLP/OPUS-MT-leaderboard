The Prague Bolsa ended with less points at the end of the day
After the early fall of the morning, the Prague Bolsa corrected his losses.
The transactions of the actions of äzzz reached approximately half of the value they have in a normal day.
The Prague Bolsa, at the beginning of the Tuesday, immediately reacted to the fall of the Monday when he descended to about 6%.
The downward of this time is to be the fall of the actions at Wall Street.
This is also expressed in the market response to the result of the vote of the American Representative Assembly that refused to support the plan for stabilising the secretariat of the financial sector.
Actions in Asia
The actions of the Asian Bolsa lived on Monday a dramatic fall, although the index finally was part of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Bolsa Seng Index during its financial day marked almost a percentage of its losses, although later he reduced the decline by almost 2,5 per cent.
The Enterprises Index of Hun Seng China, which continued to move the Chinese actions in Hong Kong's Bolsa, was 3.8 per cent, and the markets were closed in Shangai.
The actions of the Sidney Bolsa lost more than five percent, but finally losses were 4.3 per cent.
The Taiwan Bolsa, according to the Index Secretariat, was 3.6 per cent.
"The savings actions scheduled in the United States are insecure, and this affects the financial market around the world", stated the Chief of the Hong Kong Month Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, i.e., without depending on China's Central Bank.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
American legislators should be meeting as soon as possible, according to the first Australian Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt a proposal for support for the financial system.
On the other hand, threatening falls will be felt in other countries.
Blood bathroom of American actions
On Monday, the United States Representatives Assembly rejected the Financial Assistance Plan to which $7,7 million should be allocated (only $12 billion).
The legislators thus ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support their plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and would help to stabilize the whole economy.
On Monday, the American actions lived in a bloody bathroom, and mainly the index of actions was the largest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index was almost seven percent. A similar volume fall was recorded last time in 1987.
The index went down before it was announced, but soon it was shown that the proposal of the Assembly was not coming forward, the index began to fall freely.
The congress is retreated: The US government can inject $7,7 million in the bank
The highest representatives of the Congress and the Government, President George W. Bush, agreed in a widespread financial aid agreement to the American Financial System.
His vote will be held at the beginning of the next week.
American legislators have caused a break-up in the discussions on the adoption of the relief plan in their form of support to the US financial system with $7,7 billion (approximately 12 billion of colonies).
However, it is not still winned.
Congressists should ensure some details of the contract before they can publicly make the final form of law and vote.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed on Monday at the Assembly of Representatives.
He said Sunday to the Reuters Agency, Barney Frank, President of the Committee on Financial Services and the Bank of the Assembly.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be carried out in the Senate not before the Wednesday.
According to economics, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the advertising of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
However, it will be reached by the complex mechanisms whose market aid will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great progress.
We solve our discreptive views on the way to have the market stabilisation package" commented the Democrat Nancy Pelosiá to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to it, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators were meeting on Sunday night with the Minister of Finance, Henry Paulson, to give it a final form to the Government's Fund.
This should buy from financial corporations non-produced hypothetical assets leading to financial undertakings to hard losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are at the point of closing the plan convention, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we're already in that," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is expressly involved in the market of action that slows rapidly.
According to the Democratic Senator by Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are doing everything possible so that the Congress finally approve this Sunday.
They want to calm the business of investors to the Asian financial market because these are those in the first hour and where the Congress could influence the Monday trade.
However, there is no clearness now on when they vote the two cameras of the American Congress and, even if they are not at the last moment with any problem.
The legislators believe that it will be adopted in the next days.
However, the law will suffer a series of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 million must be available as soon as possible, as and as President George Bush requested.
However, the Congress may block the release of the remaining amount if it would have the impression that the programme does not comply with its role, which would be more than $100 billion and later from the last $350 million.
Bush valued the progress of meetings
On the other hand, the Chairman may consider this decision, but the Congress may exceed its vessel by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme was to win financial resources for the recovery of wicked hypotechnical titles, whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish their hypotheses.
"We've worked all.
The Assembly of Representatives should be prepared to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," commented the Republican Senator, Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of meetings.
His portavoz, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the Sabbath advance and values "the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial market and to protect our economy".
Limitation of the blinded contract
The Chairman of the Senate Bank Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that legislators had decided on the responsibilities of the programme's money for the protection of taxes from losses, a substantial clause of the programmed financial plan.
The new law should also be limited to the blind contracts for the directors of the participating society in the programme, and establish a Committee that will be controlled by the Fund.
This should be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard in this, and we have made a great progress in direction to the convention that will work and will be effective for the market and for all the Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also accounts with helping home owners who have problems with their payments.
The Government would have to agree with the new payments of the hypothes that have been undertaken in order to reduce the monthly loads of debt payments for debt periods and to make them possible to stay with their homes.
Marek: Psychology help
The proposed plan is, according to the economic leader of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be done but quite difficult.
"And this is why you don't know with what mechanism and to what prices the problems assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
That the plan is now adopted or at the beginning of the next week is not so relevant, according to Marek.
"That's more important is that, this week, the congressists are agreed to their support and give him their view of everything before it is possible.
This important and psychological agreement that the approval is reached is, at these times, the most important", said Marek.
Light the armed hand: the MP3 reproductor against mobile.
We suggest you how to choose
While almost all mobiles play MP3 files, no MP3 player can be called.
What seems clear that it's better to buy only the phone.
There are still enough reasons for the human only to buy the player.
The election depends practically on the way it uses and the demands of the future ownership.
It will probably be difficult to buy the most modern tocans to listen to him the last album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the other hand, this type of musical products, such as LP disks, isn't already out, and in terms of quality there is no objective reason to continue buy them.
If you are smiling in your stairs the vinyl disks with rock music, jazz or blues, you may be dreaming at least with this type of tocadisks.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, i.e. the compressed music, simplified - music in MP3.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some, it may be unacceptable to cost eight thousand corones in a player, as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly test the shops of the twenty corones.
Two extremes, among which there is enough space for each one.
The election is wide.
The battery is also decided on the period of the battery
Some of the best players have much more than just playing music and even the one that even the majority of the mobiles.
No current device is universal as the phone.
Through the most elemental functions such as phone, send messages, can play music and video, store both, have a better or worse photo device and even can browse.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDA will have a small computer in their box also.
This is a little wonder because no one knows to do a parrillad and no TV can be photographed.
The universality of mobiles also brings us devenge.
How many more functions use in the mobile before the screen indicator will be iluminated by requesting to be reloaded.
And music reproduction is one of the greatest energy tragons.
Some are the mobiles that can play music more than 10 or 12 hours, most of them are less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest) have clearly more performance.
They therefore take into account that the cheap mobiles will not play more than two hours.
If in addition to this, above, they are constantly called, for more safety, a loader for the work - this is also valid for the most precious devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have it, because even the worst people suffer at least 9 hours of ininterrupt function after a load.
Another problem is to write music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, only one part of the devices has the universal USB connection and, as well, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be stored directly on the memory card but only in some unlimited reader units can be connected to the small memory cards that are used in mobiles.
In players, with any exception (iPod), no special software is needed.
Shut up the device with music through the computer USB.
Most mobiles and players only create their order in the musical library according to the name of the interprete, the title of the album, gender or also according to the user assessment.
Some devices only show a directory with tree structures similar to a Windows Search and some recognize both (irver, Samsung, Sony, Cown, intellectual phones with an operational system).
The player is trying to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment interested for the resistance of the accumulator, for the memory capacity, for quality and type of sound output and, of course, for the comfort of its handle.
If you listen, especially, the music as a background and you're gonna listen to it every day only to arat, as in the tranquillity, then enough with any mobile that plays.
What practically gets any mobile.
It should not even be interested in the format where mobile or player play music.
The MP3 plays it all and almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is between the most extensive and except with him the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The least includes the AAC format (form used by the Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobiles are also possible to buy online music.
Free via the mobile web visit the relevant pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could only be a weight argument for buying a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offering of operators is miserable and most of them are limited only to the issues of success flee from radios.
The prices are not the lower.
However, it is generally supposed that this way of sale of music (or by GSM, Internet or unalmagnetic Internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always bring a mobile up.
When you want to hear something, you will find the mobile in your box, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it depends still on whether I can always take some auriculars or at least the hands free.
If not so, you can use an integrated player that has almost every mobile even if at least a MP3 player.
Probably the greatest advantage for many of the music mobiles will be your price.
The cheapest costs normally less than 3 000.
Between three and four thousand corones can already buy a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of an entry for classic auriculars.
The best, even in terms of the technical part, such as phones equipped with an entry of 3.5 mm. for classic auriculars, take up to 15.000.
Once again, the advantage of players is not another thing that their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way the cheapest (see our selection) - really handle them any person.
The minimum functions, their handling like the previous round boxes or also the tocadisks are obvious.
It is not a threat in the sense that we are wrongly connected to the mobile and, therefore, giant account for low data.
For which device is decided
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. the Vodaphone 527) have generally a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card will reach the two thousand columns.
Nevertheless, be careful.
The basic models, normally, are equipped only with a maximum 2 GB capacity card.
Only the cheapests have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and you want to be buyed a cheap MP3 player, you're looking at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
According to the capacity (such as maximum 2 GB) there is no need to expend more than 1.100 coronas.
If it is considered to be among the most amazing music demanders, escape the hands of the most specialized mobiles-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3, which makes such a comfortable service as the one player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman line have almost identical use as the of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and category in terms of price, over the four thousand columns, but with a higher memory capacity (together 16 GB) and acumulator (normally 15 hours, with a maximum performance up to 35 hours), the more referred mark would be the MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will already arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed, and our operators offer almost all services as their Western European partners.
However, there is still something we need - the virtual operator, which would have to be more cherished.
Maybe he's not late.
Checa operators are part of the most precious in Europe, we have already written it in mobil.cz.
The rest also confirmed that the Office of the Checa Telecommunication (TTU) that warned that the price of SMS messages in our country was the most precious of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulating the roaming rates, it may be a paradoxical situation - for some Czech mobile operators' SMS that are sent from the foreign would be more precise than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that the prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competence that you really want to fight.
This probably seems paradoxic, since we have three mobile networks and its high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to be regret that there is extreme competition on the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Checa Telecommunications Office, Pavel Dvośák, already expressed that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It may be true that for a classic operator with its own network no longer has any delay of possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find any frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Only the income of the virtual operator in the mobile telephone market took a decreased decline of prices before which classic operators should also react.
At the same time, even before the income of tiburons, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the Great Britain market, there were similar voices there and here.
It was demonstrated that there is place for this type of operators and that they may have success.
On the other hand, it does not need to find too far examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the star of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
Only after a half year, this operator gained more than 100 000 customers and became the fifth largest operator of the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking, the Penta Group is the owner of the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to concentrate on many more specific target groups.
In addition, so they can function effectively, enough with many less customers than a classic operator.
They do not lead to you relatively large expenditure in construction, functioning and maintenance of the network.
In the world, this type of virtual operators are normally profiled with low costs - offers cheap SMS calls and messages that, however, are often contrary to the offer of more adjusted services.
Thus, for example, the mobile Tesco in Greece offers SMS at least half of the prices in terms of competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good shock for something trivial meta group.
This operator is specifically directed to the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - is the operator who likes and who can be trusted," says David Seibert, the ECO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works with this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept as Poland could be in our country.
The Vodafone's portfolio doubts: "The checa market is relatively small to access by segments in which most virtual operators are based.
Furthermore, from the point of view of the service offer is relatively saturated"
There are no possibilities in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost sure that if there is no virtual operator in the Czech Republic that would be no Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic does not seem too hopeful.
It's better about mobilking launching in other countries of our region," said in phone conversation for mobile.cz, Jana Studničkov, porter of the Penta financial group.
It was indirectly assured that the current mobile telephone operators in the Czech Republic would not endure this idea.
Moreover, they try to do everything possible so that there is no potential competence.
Interesting on the launching of a virtual mobile operator already shows the GTS Novera group that I would like to give a step forward to become a real telephone O2 competition in the field of enterprises customers.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can provide our customers not only fixed phone services but also mobile phone services.
And how far, better.
With this possibility, we have found us repeatly with all the mobile phone operators.
With some of them we have made progress in the meetings," said the group's portal Pavel Kadl.
Then, they may have a better time.
It seems that, by non-official information, the first official operator would have to be reached at the end of the year.
But for now your appearance is accompanied by a unexpectable wall of silence.
"In these moments, we believe that the situation is appropriate for the appearance of a virtual operator on the Checa market.
The Czech market in comparison with others is a very specific market.
Until now, nobody has been directed to us with some complex and serious project on this terrain," he expressed for mobil.cz, Vlastimil MSCHeś, telephone port O2.
The specificity of the Czech market refers to other operators.
The T-Mobile port, Martina Kemrova, was exceptionally in accordance with the Opinion of O2, adds: "We have not registered no viable commercial project that, bilaterally benefited, can continue to develop."
And adds: "In the T-Mobile network will be difficult to find some virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this time we should already have on the table any concrete contract that would be possible to study in such a short horizon."
Vodafone provides its best attention to complying with the own requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav śepickī adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this relates to the distribution of expenditure and infrastructure.
We just consider it as the greatest contribution from the customers' view.
The main strategy of Vodaphone in this field is found in the partner with whom sets a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsibilities - with wood and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can easily be understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increased competitiveness, which would lead to a decline of profits.
Then, why should the entry into competition be facilitated?
When the operators want to get something, they're able to get out of the same round, testing that is the shooting when U:fon occurred.
Maybe the biggest pressure to the T-Mobile was at the time of the U:fon for the T-Mobile society.
The public information is available on the websites of the ✔TU.
But just now U:fon serves as a argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrova adds: "Before, it is not much that the competitive environment on the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
As regards the nature of the mobile telephone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player in the market would provide for it and, in particular, for its large services."
That is why this access to mobile operators is a tremendous dealing because of the absolute disinterval of the Czech regulator body.
It is not only the post of the ŠTU, which has unfortunately no competence in the commercial contributions, as regards Great Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs to the Office for the Protection of Trade Guide (UOHS).
However, this expressed its typical posture before this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator to the mobile telephone market would be possible after a convention on the requiring of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephone operator and a virtual operator.
Until today, no convention has been closed since the offering of the potential interested was not enoughly interesting for classic operators," added to our question, Christian Chalupa, the Department of Foreign Relations of the UNOHS.
These statements are not surprised to the representatives of the operators.
For consumer interest offices, it is something more than a consideration, otherwise it must be noted that no one uses their market position.
In particular when Christián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign area where virtual operators operate normally, we can observe that their entry in the market has contributed to the lowest prices of mobile telephone services"
Obviously the pressure on the correct functioning of the market means and price down does not involve UOHS interest.
Really the dramatically shocking in all this case stricts in the dissonning reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a case, it is offered by himself alone.
It is the same as the price of gas in gas lines, as it is clear that it is the work of the possibility and a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office has found no signs of unlawful competition and has therefore no reason for any action.
No operators have, therefore, a dominant position in the market, have no relevant responsibilities in their actions.
The tools necessary to open the mobile telephone market to virtual operators, moreover, are missing as well as telecommunication regulators," added to their answer Chalupa.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflicting points.
It is obvious that there is an analysis of relevant markets elaborated by the UCU that telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial offering a single market.
In this type of market, of course, no Czech operators have a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - so that a virtual operator is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has the monopolie of its network.
Therefore, in a specific segment, it must be necessaryly dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS should represent a warning the fact that three mobile operators are called as a similar.
The current complaints of interested persons (including the GTS Novera company) show that in all negotiations with operators, they are shocked with many similar obstacles.
Loading responsibility in  zuTU is a very common truck in the field of telecommunications which UOHS is loaded in all this matter.
We have met him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, recently, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act was submitted to the expansion of the Competition in the field of commercial offers that did not result, even when a series of experts promised that the situation would be improved.
This must perfectly know the representatives of UOHS, but it is obvious that their interests are on the other hand.
It's all right, when no one looks
At the same time, unexpectedly works something as a pseudoviral operator that already exists in the checa mobile telephone networks.
They are companies who put their own prices to mobile telephone services, but only one part is public.
Normally it is companies dedicated to multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile telephone services.
Normally only some chosen people have the list of prices of these companies.
The magic is in which the company, with regard to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same, loading a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer will receive after special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions in all mobile telephone operators prohibit that type of return.
"If cases such as those quoted could be discovered in the contract conditions that could be translated to the end of the cooperation with the given society," he responded to the question about this problem, Martina Kemrova.
But it is quite impossible that an activity of this type by mobile telephone operators would not be reached to people responsible.
Only in the case of the three enterprises mentioned can be treated by thousands of customers.
No operators are opposed to this procedure.
With the activities of these enterprises, there are nothing unprecedented gains and, at the same time, - different from the authentic virtual operators - no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav śepickī warns us about the possible problems: "the law allows a speculation of this type, however, the company services are used only for a sweet of hundreds of customers.
They should also accept that the SIM card of your phone is not in your name, so you can't have it absolutely as a normal customer of operators."
That's just what you should look at the minimum strange.
Furthermore, there is a new question for UOHS.
If mobile telephone operators round the eyes in this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activities and if it is not wanting to be satisfied with the explanations of operators that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When we'll stop being the most precious
As it was clear in the text, the entry of the virtual telephone operator on the market was significantly decreased in the services prices.
At the same time, almost in almost all countries where the virtual operator occurred, classic operators tried to be protected from this irruption.
The arguments used by these were almost all identical - too small, a market, eventually too saturated, problems with the quality of the service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, the regulatory bodies have been in these times and in any case, they have defended operators but their customers.
He was already with formal or informal pressure measures reached the first virtual operator and began to happen to others.
Unfortunately, the Checo Regulation Authority all this case happens as if it would be treated by a slowing clamp.
For our experience, we cannot stop impressing the confusion of assignments in these cases.
But we're not going to disappoint.
If this information between pustikers is correct, and the virtual operator really arrives to these lands, then the checa market of the mobile phone probably begins to move again.
If some of the operators let any virtual mobile telephone operator be difficult to remain independent of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested persons.
And we may stop calling more money than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hill has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official heno.
On Sunday, the first Minister Miek Topolánek at the day of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official record of the Heno where, my home.
The new heavy recorded it the National Theater's orchestra under the direction of Jiśí Bślohlavek.
There are four versions - two versions that are Solos, one men's voice and another women's voice, another with Coro and another instrumental.
From the songs are loaded by Kateśina Knśinkov and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the Henoch arrangements are Otakar Jeremiách and Jaroslav Krček.
The iHNeed.cz server can listen to the four versions.
Bślohlavek considers this national checo song as one of the most beautiful helloes.
The Czech Radio already said before he intentionally elected for the songing Solos with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"When the principle I tried with both and then, also, with the Law that is finished in the word so that the text was well understood, so that it might be consonance," he commented.
The Czech official helicopter celebrates the next year on 175 birthday.
The song Where, my Hogar was the first time in 1834 in the theatre of the States in the original checa Fidlovačka of Josef Kajetán Tyl and corrected with the music of František šcroup.
He won popularity and people did it.
The first throff of the song after Czechoslovakia occurred in 1918 was naturally converted into a part of the official heavy.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the appearance of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" lynoe
The MHD of Praga takes us Tuesday for the first time with the chip
On Thursday, 1 October 2008, the date in which the first passengers enter the metro, the trail and the bus with a good electronic in their tickets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be acquired in these moments by almost hundred thousand people have the Chip Opencard card.
The passengers can buy the 30 days, 90 days and the year (est will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously loaded it in their chip card in the centres and posts of the transport company in the Metro, Muzeum, Mśstek, Nádraиí Holešovice, Andśl, Roztyly, Letśany, Kobylisy, Rajská Zaharrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Goods can be purchased since yesterday on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until late, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who are starting to use the Internet as a trade shape, may eventually begin to forget the sell positions in the metro stations, where they should still regularly make a collar to get out of a normal ticket.
The bonus is buyed online, and the Opencard card reloads it in some of the thirty branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places passengers are available a window with personnel prepared that helps interested persons with buying online and also with the reload of the good buyed in their card," said the project portal Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the library, you will also be able to reload the bonus electronic in the Opencard on the automatic machines that are located in some metro swimming machines.
How are these extensive machines?
They are red, remember a swimming machine and travellers probably have already been set on them in the stations of Roztyly, Budæjovicka, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There is in the city five but at the end of the year, it would have to be 80," Opatrný completed.
The good is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Quick to introduce in it the Opencard card and the previously paid card will be loaded only in it.
The good electronics since tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In the bus trains and bus lines from the 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of central Bohemia.
"In the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviews equipped with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of time and the area of the good," explained the control of the shoes, Philip Drapal of the Ropid organization, which establishes the times of Prague's collective transport.
Circular buses have their reader cards mounted on the driver's taste.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard in the place to it on the side of the Box.
Thus, the driver controls the validity of the good.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the goods there is no more easyer than requesting the driver this information", completed Drapal.
The passengers that do not travel in the circle bus and do not remember when the validity of the good is completed can be directed to expenditure machines where the cards are reloaded.
Here, in the machine screen, the information about the validity of your document will be shown.
South-East wanted to be part of the United States in a referendum
German Swedens requested in 1945 that Fumaba was part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter which is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the U.S. patronate.
This desire was presumablely addressed by some Sweden German groups to the President of the United States in 1945.
Results of the letters that are stored in a particular file and are now stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans from Krumlov requested a letter to the American President that does not allow the return of "the Territory Šumava" - that Hitler is under the Munich Pact - again to Checoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we really want their word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemy, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed with a "the people who bring the destination of Zhumava in their heart".
In view of the unity of Czechoslovakia with the south-East Germans presumablely - the Czech National Charter - a hope only in brutality, desconsideration, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors rule in the letter to the American President who smile for today and forever in Šumas under a protective.
"We can't believe that without considering the opinion of four million people, we deliver to a foreign state that opposes and rejects minorities and that it is absolutely cooperating with the victory of the allies," is written in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumablely the fear of reprises of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States presumably doubts about this idea of the Shomavo Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum on whether its people want to be part of the United States or live under their patron.
Despite the text of the letter, with the knowledge that we have today in the history of poguera, we can feel a little child, according to some specialists attractively draw the expectations of the Germans in the southwest of then.
Although the Czech Germans had to intuite at least that they would be treated on their expulsion from the Republic only some of them accepted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate any clear way of autonomy for Sweden.
Others believed they would stay in Checoslovakia.
It is also confirmed by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in śeské Budśjovice.
This was in the war, as a German of Budhjovice, rolled into the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war, the Britishs arrested him and moved him into the field of German prisoners for decades, they went to him to teach them checo.
"They believed that when they returned home, the cheese would sell them well," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, had found that, on the basis of the Benes Decrees, they would be displaced from the Republic.
I don't know! I'm going to tell you!
Emotive campaign attacks drivers
The most fair action in the Czech history is directed to security on the roads.
Thus, the emotive campaign that decided to launch Monday the Ministry of Transport in the Mediterranean could be characterized.
The Minister's office, Aleš śebæek, promises that he will disagree dangerous conductors to the flight.
The campaign of 150 million will be feeling on television, radio, cinema, Internet and telephones.
I would have to disagree the driver of high speed and alcohol at the flight.
And also to remember you that before you move, the censors are waiting.
He wants to be conscious of all young drivers, motorists, peatants and finally also of professional drivers.
What is what we can see in the ads?
Basically human historys that employ emotions.
And for this, the "sanguinary" ads during the whole campaign:
I don't know! I'm going to tell you!
The word "Don't think" is written with large letters in the matrix.
And in a blood lock, it's the word "pagues".
This must symbolize that man at a moment of dispense can get to pay with his own life.
The advertisements will be "measuring" to spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was left to inspire the campaign carried out in anglesaylands where strong images of victims of accidents can be observed.
Promise that in this way the accidents and the number of dead on the cheek roads will be reduced.
The advertisements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar and sweat for drivers
"To drivers, the sugar and milk system is worth.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a senaphor occurs in red and so takes time.
Latigo is threatening a lot or accident.
The drivers must remember the risks," says the psychologist of transport of the hospital Na Homolce, Martin Kośán.
And therefore there is an information campaign in the press and mostly a negative advertising, specifically the psychologist.
The less effective for him are the panels that advertise the driving of dangers.
"If there is any installed panel warning of any danger probably soon will be fumed with the environment and the driver will not give you more attention," warned Kośán.
Olmert would return almost all the areas employed in change of peace
The President of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, was pronounced about the refund of almost all the lands occupied in 1967, namely West Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in change of peace with Palestinian and Syria.
I proposed in the interview that the Monday appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.
"We must reach a agreement with Palestinians, which means that we must necessarily return almost all the lands (occupied) if it is not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We shall certainly remain with a hundred percent of these lands, but the Palestinians shall have to cease them a percent similar (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be peace," he added.
He acknowledged that Jerusalem would also be included in the case of refund.
"What he wants to be safe in Jerusalem, and therefore he did not want to pass through the tractors or scatters above his feet as he passed to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," said Olmert in reference to the two attacks of July in the city where there were several dead and decades of people were blessed.
According to the President, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple colline, a sacred and historic place" located within the ancient city.
"The one who wanted to maintain the Israeli sovereignty in the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work", he stressed further.
Remote of the Highs of the Golan
Olmert was also pronounced by the retirement of Israel from the Altars of Golan, which from his view is an inherent condition to close a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also include concrete efforts by Damasco.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the Golan retirement," warned.
"The Syrians know well what they'll have to be disappointed to win Golan.
They must leave their current relationship with Iran, leave their relationship with Hizbula (China movement) and have to be disappointed from the permanent support that causes the terrorism of Hamas (China movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Yihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the first minister.
Questions after the accident: Isn't the slaughter in buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk in a long distance bus
With regard to the tragic accident of the company's University Agency near the Italian city of Patva, we will ask whether the bus and passengers can move by the bus during the trip.
"If we wish to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the azafata is opposed to the vial transit law," says the port of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the last week died the slaughter of twenty-five years, obviously, was caused by the truck driver only that the bus was crossed on the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sit next to the driver at the less safe place of the vehicle, despite having booked two other sites.
However, the bus may have an accident or driving swiftly, and at the precise time that the slaughter departs the coffee or the newspapers.
This is what the paper plays is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with foot places.
If the bus is not authorized, the passenger must go sit.
The long-distance buses from the University Agency have no footnote sites, which confirmed the director of the company, Radim Jančura, to Update.cz.
"This we have solved with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, this took it and we arrived to agree that passengers can go to the bathroom if they have sit," she commented our position.
Azafat does not know the law
" There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the azafate - no legal provisions acknowledges this role.
There is no legal provision for the transport agents to carry out any service.
The road transport law only knows the term of vehicle revisor, whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds the portal Hanzelka.
The Director of the Trafficking Department on Transports, Josef Pokorný, thinks that the law is sufficiently attracted to this problem.
"Depends on whether the bus has the authorisation allowed to have foot sites.
That's all," says.
Buses are divided between the urbans, where there are places to be swimming and maximum speed, interurbans with sites to be swimming with a higher speed permit and the long distances without foot to go, with the higher speed permit and the seats equipped with security snake.
As in the flight, the expert says
The EESIP security experts in the transport, Jaroslav Hośín, do not see important problems regarding the shock movement in the bus.
"When travel development is not much dangerous, the situation can be compared with aircraft services.
Not even here is the safeness that the turbulences arrive and that the slaughter can be shocked in the head."
"Bus, however, if the fresh bus is obviously valid the physical laws.
Like in a city bus or in the tranquily.
The security of the azafate must solve the internal regulation of the transporter," says and also thinks that this problem is without resolving.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only transporter offering azafates service.
She works in him to two hundreds.
The director, nor after the accident, considers that strict work.
"But, at the moment when it has the impression that the azafata post is arried, then I will remove it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, when they enter.
I would even pay expenditure," says.
Security is the reason why Asiana lacks a snack in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which directs a small line in comparison with SA.
"We have no snacks, we are against them since the beginning.
Before or later this will end in a death accident," said less than one year ago to Tøden.cz.
There was a great tragedy.
On the line accident that one in Nápoles died a young slaughter of Pilsen who had worked for the company two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned out of the station cart by locking the walk to the bus.
His driver tried to avoid it, however, to the right front side.
Jančura refuses to sell the two sites that are booked for the relaxing of the azafata.
"This sites are not possible to book them for long distance connections, are blocked."
The company intends to ask the truck driver.
The Agency will not wait for the judgment on the compensation of the girl's family but expects financial expenditure as well as by the fault.
Reform of the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could make a greater accuracy on the movement of the azafate in the bus, where 30 members are working for a group of the Ministry of Transport.
"But there has been no concrete conclusion.
They are not too much dedicated to bus, but better to the point system, maximum speed in cars and the use of the mobile during the walk," says the experts Hośin.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of slaughters in a major manner to change the safety of passengers," concluded Hanzelka's portal, that the security control in bus is the police competence and the Security Office in the work.
Dusseldorf's hope is supported in Francfort
In the letter of the West LB joint directive for its collaborators, there are no major words.
For the fusion of Dusseldorf bank units with the DEKA bank, it can be formed as a central capital market of Sparkassen's financial group, as it says, on Monday.
The West LB Bank, broken the 'competitive block' with sustainable benefit capacity would enter into such business.
In addition, such a fusion may be a start for the following fusions in the field of regional banks.
The text is understood when a joint directive wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because the same as before West LB is under a huge pressure.
Not only from the part of the European Union, but also of the Federal Institute for Financial Services Monitoring, which has recently made clear to the Government of North-Westfalia's Renaissance that remains a short time to find a solution.
Since a long time, too from the Francfort part, it is talking about the unions of such types between the DEKA bank, that Sparkasis customers know for their investment funds, and West LB.
Indeed, Frank Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presented the data after a half year at the end of August, left out that no sense in the fusion of the bank, located on the Mainzer Street street, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
However, the DEKA Administration Board, which is now composed of the regional banks and Sparkassen' associations, has initiated negotiations with West LB on common trade activities.
This could be a business on the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations are just starting, so it is said in the financial site.
It is not the first time that it is the consolidation in Sparkassen appears the name of the DEKA bank, which with its 3000 collaborators is among the most important entrepreneurs in the Francfort financial site.
In 2003, the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could fusion with the Renania-Palatinado regional bank and Helaba.
This initiative for establishing a three-party unity has remained without results.
Only the plans were public, and the Government of Hesse was expressed against the participation of Helaba in this project.
The other two banks did not find the same language.
Instead of that, the regional bank of the Renania-Palatinado began the dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank.
But it was always again playing with the DEKA bank fusion idea with other regional banks.
But finally, the President of the Helaba Joint Directive, Sunther Merl, expressed that he was against the coexistence plans with his bank.
Independence of this seems to be more clear that the unification of the various banks in the field of public law is necessary.
So when the Baviera Parliament's elections are going on, the BayernLB Union with the Regional Bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For the Helaba that results not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure continues to fusion, Helaba will miss the partners to do that.
In the south of the bank, it could be only a young partner, although even now it was much better than the financial crisis that made it the immuebles of Stuttgart and Munich.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - and Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which possesss the 85 percent of Helaba, avoided coexistence plans with the West LB.
In any case only North LB is left.
But these geo-strategic reflections are only one part.
This is also the compatibility of the various bank models.
In June, Merl asked a fundamental question on a commercial model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, so that the German Spain and Giro Verband did not answer until now.
Finally, West LB can be discomponed, but that is, of course, not the own desire of the bank.
In the letter of the joint bank Directive, it is also said that it would try to find a full solution to the whole bank.
As you can combine the coexistence between individual parts of the bank with the DEKA, it will show the time.
The second weekend of October Fest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, he helped Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, says he.
After them, on the side of a 5-like blue barrile of Kaiser mark is built a huge tiger that shows nearly 200 participants of October feast that sounds lowly knows producing in their gargant.
First Elena gives Luca a palmed, then a cup.
From the Bolivia arrived to Verona.
From there, from the accommodation next to the train station Porta Newa, this night at 23:45 are three buses, 'direction Munich, the bird party', predicted at 6:30 of the morning.
Three buses are predicted primarily for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the skins of the parking side of their band are sing the South Americans, they had already started celebrating night.
With a lot of laugh, Marco Watch says, that's nothing for Italians.
In Marco, who takes a long board with an artificial skin fore and skin skin with plate color balls, belongs to the bus.
Since five years ago, they come to October, taking into account that only this year has been three excursions.
From night on the path there, during the day in the beach, at 22:30 p.m.
Passing the night there means only the unnecessary expenditure, says Marco.
The travel costs 75 euros, including the receipt of welcome with a Kaiser bird that was done according to the Baviera's cleaning law, the disease security and the guide in German-Marco attended a language course in Francfort.
Tonight buses are already on the road on the car with the "Brennero" address
There's no bird, not yet.
Real peace in the bus quickly, travellers are sleeping.
All right, they will still need the forces.
It is to Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian matrix make another break on the 8-low car.
Finally, when the Marco group has arrived at 6.30 p.m. on the accommodation side of the Prade of Teresa, there are about 50 other buses throughout Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco has his last conversation on the way to go.
First, put a gorge.
There, from the left, it is written "Oktoberfest", on the side of the geotical letter is the page of the Mark’s travel office on the internet: "concertivisioning.it".
Second: "When the doors of the camping store are open, that means marking!", Marco crys on the lunch.
"Marca!" Mark and busy the back sites in the campsite.
"Don't take the front sites, because we're gonna lock, and everyone with earliest gorge do not sense you in the same banky, distributed in all spaces!"
A blue letter, red Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the propine
Show the security people that we have a good ton!
Once you get out of his site, he will be already busy!"
Third: "This afternoon, at 10 and a half, you have to come here!" Have you heard?
And now everyone goes to October.
One, to mark the path, shoot the shoes in the trees, traffic signals and even in a card of the choices of a large Baviera Popular Party.
You want to recognise the way behind.
It's the second weekend of October festival that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There is no precise data on the number of people; it is about 500,000 people traveling on the Alpes and tormentally entering the campaigns, 10 percent of all have been particularly in Italy's weekend.
The police of Munich receives assistance from seven police from the autonomy province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Red Cross of Baviera, which makes a statistical statistics of the nations present, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, prior to the Englishs (circumstance of 60 assistance) and Austrians take the first place.
The favorite winter of the Italian campaign is so called Hofbrüuselt.
The nights without sleep for the Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stabil, only the Federal Minister of Finance Peter Steinbrück last week.
Well, that the policy would use the word "relationally" and added that the German banking area will also affect the critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich’s immune finance, which is counted in the DAX index, receives a consortium of German banks a thousands of dollars to be able to resist to turbulences on the market.
Monday, a person who knows the situation very well said to Reuters: credit aid was up to EUR 35 billion.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use must be interested.
The money also comes from the private banks of public law.
This is the cause of losses of the Depfa filial.
According to a report, state finances with the money provided for long-term projects have financed them only a short period - which is now, because of the uncertainty on the market.
In the first half of the year the bank's capital reserve has fallen in a 95%, EUR 2.37 million, and the share of the capital has also decreased a little of 1.6% to 1.45%.
In comparison with the same period of the last year, the continuing income of financial investment and net benefits of financial operations had fallen up to zero, the debt tax revenues and some value titles also resulted in the dissolving of appropriations of credit businesses to be lowered by over 70 percent, in EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and many income of the compensation costs of the former Depfa group restructuring, as well as the reimbursement of interests according to the Federal Tax Code and the contracts organized for consortium companies, the negative sale could acknowledge a deficit of about 16 percent more.
After privacy in 1990, the former State finance was lost in speculations with industrial credits for immovials, which was due to the foundation of the Aareal Bank.
As much money could be winned with the financing of state projects, Defa began intensely dedicating projects in the infrastructure and the financing of Community projects by private investors and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and was diversified.
The Hypo Real Estate has now to be encouraging on the value of the subsidiary, which will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of losses and profits of the group, is very clear.
It's a fact that they canceled the dividends.
They were already cancelled by two thirds for 2007.
After the purchase of the Depfa, Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial financial in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not have customer deposits, it is more dependent on refinancing on the interbank market, compared with other banks.
With the chief of the United States investment bank Lehman Brothers, what happened two weeks ago, the grant of interbank credits was essentially slow because the banks were slowing their liquidity.
Each year, Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a part of the Defa credit cards of its short-term measures for refinancing.
According to Hypo Real Estate's report, the bank covers the need for financing the group for a short time, and the company is assured that "the influence of the international monetary markets that now are not essentially appropriate to operate"
Other sources say that refinancing is guaranteed by this money until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, President of the Joint Real Estate Hypo Real Group, explained that Hypo Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for the predictable time.
The German Central Bank and the Federal Institute of Financial Services Monitoring (BaFin) are part of the basis that Hypo Real Estate Group's competitiveness is assured from now.
That must be waiting for shareholders and bank creditors.
But because of the dynamic and the imperativeness of the crisis there is no constantness.
It is even imaginable that there is no need to finance in its full volume.
But the other case cannot be excluded.
It would be the voice that at last Sunday the bank was still almost insolvency, so temporary salvation can not be quiet at least concerned.
The price of action was 75 percent, EUR 3.30.
Rating courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts are almost not changed, the rates of the loans according to the position in the ownership registered are clearly low.
Affected are mostly the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo, and with the reason of the lendings whose refunds are rebased 2009.
After the significant growth of the bank crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa affected by the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that previously were an investment for speculations must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While embassy banks, Governments and banks that are not affected are still ready to support the system, as long as pension amortization can be taken within a period of time.
Or something is going to happen, which is not angry to imagine anyone - the financial crisis will exceed in the next 15 months.
But when we see the crossed news on partial statistical statistics, now the security that is already in its limit has become a justificated hope.
This will be a reason, because the creditors will pass the night without sleep, broke the head on the decision on their isolation of enthusiasm.
Even short-term investors can put the final point and use new losses transport for the next payment of benefits compensation taxes for the future.
Sylvana and Bent's secrets?-Box
When the first day of Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to be presented at Tachibana High School, the girls began to ride: the German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges she accounts for Japan.
"The first day in a college in Japan.
I felt nervous.
I was afraid before I went to the college.
I live at the border of Tokyo in the Kawasaki direction and I'm going to train 40 minutes at high school Tachibana.
I had to find the way, for luck I didn't lose me.
It seems that the start of the classs is not so strictly set as in my home, in Baja Sajion.
From the eighth morning, students, at least ninety-two, start a small meeting with teachers, the 'home room'.
Before I started the class, I had touched me to present me.
In addition, I am not a person who speaks very much of the public, especially before a class of 40 students.
As they still have the uniform schooler put me a old sweet of the mother of my anfitrion family and also a blue, blue calcetines and black shoes of skin.
So, I put my clothes to the pupil and I tried to express everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - I call Sylvana, I am from Germany and a week will be my birthdays.
At this time I was very happy because for the years I had started studying this language.
All 31 girls in the class have kissed, king and signs and all the time I heard the word "kawaii"
I've already known my Mangas.
This belongs to the Japanese vocabulary of survival and means "mona, beautiful"
Then I was slowly shooted on my place.
The girl on the side had a great dream, for she was a honor that the girl of exchange had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quiet, but when he sounded the gong, I felt really shocked.
Everyone talked at the same time, riding and making many questions - at the same time it was very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the recreation, they were all their Blessings.
My family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else that burned pieces of German pane.
He had sweet with skins, small skins, pepine salt, fruit and something like meat in tofu meat.
In most cases I have no idea of what this is here in Japan.
The things are rare and have a new sweet.
What is sure is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with exceptions of marine cyrus in the salt, buff!
In Japanese schools the stages are not just a lunch.
Sometimes, a girl is preparing a blessed made in a very artistic way for a boy and is in hope of being able to know it better during a recreation.
I read that in my Manga-Comics.
I'm so curioso to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" they asked me my friends when I told you I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year of school.
Then I always answered:
"Good, because I'm fascinating."
Finally, for years I prefer to read Mangas.
To better understand the comics and culture, one day I started study a bit of Japan.
For me it was absolutely sure that one day I'm going to travel there.
Also because I have a flag for tradition and habitat.
Here they have a great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, and otherwise it is a serious, disciplinary and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn't feel lost here even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings
It is said that a rat or a kitchen feeling the danger slows, why have you also feared?
Joseph Le Doux, scientist in neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can they be controlled if, in the similar way to us, they feel the same?
In a online magazine called "Edge" for many years, the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers selected to the question What do you think what is true without ability to prove?
I think the animals have feelings and other conscious states without me or someone else can prove it until now, although we can not even prove that others have conscience.
But in this case we can at least wait for it because all human brains present the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we offered to other species and include questions about feeling and generally on conscience, we enter into the unknown area because hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same as the other animals: the dead is done, flee or attack.
People are conducted in such a manner, as some scientists make conclusions on comparable subjective experience.
Of course, I don't think.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to contain our subjective experience to the animals.
First, almost always they include circuits associated with human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal plot of the brain (from their participation in the short memory and the executive functions leading to conduct).
This wide range is much more developed in the case of people than the other primates, and it seems that it is absolutely lacking in other creatures.
In view of at least the aspects mentioned to our conscience that depends on the prefrontal log of the brain cortex, including knowledge about whom we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to suggest that even the man is different from the other primates.
Another particularity is found in man's language nature: as most of his experience is associated with the language, it often means that conscience depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even when consciousness would not depend on the language, it would influence the conscience of the animals, created as well, in many cases it would differ from the majority of our conscious states.
Therefore it is difficult to explain how the conscience of other animals works.
If that's, as something interesting and subjective, nor let you measure because you have the special hardware, nor let you analyze through our experiences, so your research presents great problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the consistent experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of conscience that would be more easy for scientific research.
Animal consciousness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that's what happens during short primates-memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, it is essential to the neutral correlations of conscience than the cause mechanisms: both may be similar or not.
Currently this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal luxury of the brain cortex for the training of visualization.
What does that result for feelings?
I have the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is responsible for it, the same thing happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the brain activity is employing a space of the defence system (or its consequences, for example, the reactions of the body).
Since this point of view, the feelings are very fixed by the brain cortex which distinguishes primates and above all man.
From the view of the language nature, we continue to classify the final sense because we can distinguish and classify states with the words and graphics so that we can describe the states of others to ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasco thinks that the feelings result from the simple activity of the part of the brain're ceremonial style and of the enzyme, he'reing Jaak Pankseep, but it's more focused on the thrombolazer.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can be absolutely referring to different types and feelings.
For theoretical reasons I can't go against that, but I think it's not likely.
Pakseep argus that what rats and men feel as fears, possibly it feels in two cases as well: But how can you be able to control whether rats and men act like that?
When you see the danger, a shooting shooting, you know why you're afraid?
I believe that the likeness of conduct is still not testing the likeness of experience.
That is true that the neuron comparison of help: ratas and men have similar encephal throwings, the cuts on the other hand have no at least one brain.
Is it the throat of the encephal which is responsible for feelings?
Even when it is possible to test it for men: How can you prove it in case of rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, possibly also the kitchens (who knows it?), have feelings.
But I don't know how it can prove it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behaviour of rats that emotional feelings because their feelings are essentially distinguished from us (for human conscience refers to special circles and language).
In any case, progress is expected in the area of neurology while the same rats and men are seen.
As I don't invest the language and the consciousness of rats, and feelings, I don't know whether they exist.
You can say that I don't see any more outside my narcs, but I prefer to progress to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emocionalist.
The President of the EUFA Platini: grace term for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the Prime Minister, said that the preparations will be prepared prematurely under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The Government looks at the EUFA decision in Bordeaux as a test of confidence of Ukraine's capacity to organize the European campaign together with Poland," said Watjunik.
"But that isn't an amniist for our country.
Now the work is starting, and in the two countries there is much to do."
The time of construction and reconstruction of stations, streets, hotels and airports in the Anfitrion countries is cooked.
Maybe the number of stages will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose more time.
Now we have to work with great speed," said the President of an Ukrainian Grigori Surkis association.
"EUFA will not remove our eyes."
In Poland a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish Association PZPN and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee was meeting at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that PZPN is not able to follow the rules", Drzewiecki said to the Polish news Agency.
"In a letter we have assured the President of the EUFA Platini that the preparation of the 2012 chamber will not suffer from this."
Only in the last time many clubs of the first division were condemned because of manipulation in decline to the lower category, finally the division counsel had to be suspended.
Dumping Dennis Quaid Contrattack
She wanted to promote a new film, speaking in a interview on private life - and she had problems with her ex-marry: Hollywood Meg Ryan's star designed her ex-marine as an adulster.
It's enormous and contra-attacked.
The late war of the two faces in the ex-pair of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two actors of Hollywood publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan was announced for the first time about the reasons of marriage failure: "Dennis was very unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knows the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new "The Women" film - a story of the failure of a marriage.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "inquired how many times Meg accounted of the history of our relationship in another version", said the man of 54 years to "New York Daily News".
Among other things are very "smile" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "I'll remember in public pain and changes, everything means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lived after divorce alone, Quaid is again married, and just a few days ago he is Dad of Gemmels.
And so ends with his statements by emphasising: "See as my life continues.
I'm happy because I have a wonderful family that's fine."
The prices of airlines and hotels are low
In the first half of 2008, the aircraft and the pernotations in Europe were more cherished comparing the last year.
According to a current study, the aircrafts in Germany were low to 50 percent.
The aircraft and the pernotations in hotels were again worthy - this is the result of a study of the travel services provider and the financial services of American Express.
The company has analyzed its reservation data of the first half of 2008 and after the increased prices in the first quarter, the company noted a great change in the second half.
After many years the hotel market prices continued to increase, the pernotations in many places were worthy.
In comparison with the last year, prices from January to March 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased in average 6,9 percent.
From April to June the prices have already dropped to 3.6 percent comparing the last year.
The trends were more perceptive in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for this was the debilitated dollar course, which was the cause of "the interests of American tourists in traveling reduced."
The reduction in the prices of hotels is also more noted in financial centres such as Francfort or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger.
In the Norway city, hotel prices increased by 26.3 per cent and thus spend a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, the aircraft prices also showed the upward trends:
As a result of the increase in the prices of the Economy Class travellers, 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long distance flights were even more costly to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June the prices of aircraft in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, slowed at average 12,5 per cent, but the price changes for the business class and the First Class were small.
In Germany, price change was more notable than in other European countries:
From January to February the prices increased at 11.9, in the second half of the half, 23.6 per cent.
According to a study, the prices for national flights in Germany even reduced half.
The cause of price change is from one part the increase in the fleet economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the market with the flight, the demand is down.
On the other hand, there is a great competence for the Open-Skies Treaty that liberalizes the traffic between the United States and Europe.
The signal of the tenso situation is the cancellation of non-lucrative distances in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared in Quieb - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a gol and simple methods, Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia is still not going to make the decimoprior gol.
Christffer Klein has very well presented the forced atterrissage of the player of the national Marko Martin selection.
Gladbach player started playing late and failed to make a gol.
Everything I wanted to say exactly by reacting to what happened, it could be clearly read from your lips.
I only knew I was right.
"We need a second gol," Silbaba Hermann Rieger in the chain in the Hamburg stadium.
I do not pass anything special in the catacubs, the time of relaxing ended, and most of the presents were again on their sites.
Rieger was almost three decades of HSV physiotherapeutic, very much reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
So his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol, the assistant trainer, attended the head and led the fingers in a warning sign.
Cornelius is a brother of Martin Jol, the main trainer of Hamburg.
Your order was the same: go, the second gol!
But that was not done.
"How wasn't everything pleased to see", he added after Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhard had also wanted to have "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg must thank Mladen Petric (11) with its head impact; and the situation that the Gladbach team was very weak could not show its entire strength to the weak team of Hamburg.
"This was a Swiss victory," said Mr. Martin Jol.
This Monday, Hamburg's SV will meet its 121 years.
The Saturday of being the spectators had already celebrated their own, the blue heaven on the stadium and the table change in the video screen.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know to interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
It is expected that the partial qualifications of the table correspond more to the veilability of the link than the dominance of its HSV.
The chip with his obliged players as Neves and Silva, the Petric goal, as well as Jansen, who was removed from FC Bayern, needs time to join, but the chip can still not brillie with its success.
"We need more than feeling and dribbling," requires Jol.

Dark material affects the trayectory of space sounds
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon causes the unconsciousness to researchers: the Dark Materie affects the speed of space sons during this time called serious assistance to the maneuver.
The experts are afraid that Albert Einstein's Relative Theory could not be so correct.
The "Ulysses" space survey passed almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because fuel tubers are now shutting the threat to death in the fridge.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, anomaly during the serious assistance to the manobra, causes the disconsciousness between researchers.
The serious assistance is a manipulation of space sons trayectory while they obtain a acceleration using the energy of the gravity field of a planet, for example.
This allows space sounds to burn fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space sonda used this physical truck as it made the Sun Ulysses.
But what the investigators surprised for many years: the missiles do not conduct 100 percent as they are expected according to the venerable pregnancy law.
More frequencies are irregularities of the speed.
Sounds have higher or lower speed of improvisedness.
Physicals could not explain this effect until now.
They called it anomality during the serious assistance to the manipulation.
Some experts are afraid that even the general theory of Albert Einstein's Relativeness, which describes the material attraction force for the curvature of space, cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American Physical of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton, believes solely now as before Einstein did not confusion and tried to explain the anomaly during the serious assistance with so called Dark Materie, which remained as astronomists in the universe.
"The reason of anomaly may be the Dark Material that can also be very close to the earth," he wrote.
The researchers of the universe know the existence of the Dark Material since 10 years.
Instead, it has the attraction force and its influence can be observed in other planets.
The Dark Material, on the contrary, is completely invisible what means that it does not send and does not reflect any electrical radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, the Dark Material is at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
The secundary tourists in Egypt are free
As the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Italy confirmed, after ten days in the hands of seculars, tourists in Egypt should be released.
Sudan seculars had requested millions of savings.
Six seculars should be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans are secuted in the south of Egypt.
The negotiations on rescue have already been started.
Germans are always on the point of attention of students.
The WELT ONLINE magazine refers to the most important cases.
For this reason, European tourists in Sahara are free.
About that the same information presents the state television of Egypt, the embassy of Arab Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news on release in Italian Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, Italian minister of Foreign Affairs, confirmed the release: "We are civilians and other rehens are free.
'We are controlling your health status now' said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Roman as well as their eight Egyptian partners are well and are in security, inform the state of Egyptian television.
The 19 participants in the wilderness are on the road to Cairo.
What is incomprehensible was the reasons of a shot before the release of the rehenses: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the seculars were ready to end with the secular, but the Sudan army suddenly killed six seculars.
"The problem was solved.
They were in accordance with the rescue," the guard said.
It was just "recibing the rehens" when suddenly came "This surprise."
The Sunday, the Sudan soldiers killed six seculars and two of them were arrested in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The seculars requested the savings in the amount of six million euros from Germany; the money had to deliver the German wife of one of the rehenses.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was late because the seculars feared their security.
According to the report, the seculars intend to release women from women after receiving the rescue.
The men had to stay arrested until the seculars had a safe route to run.
The German Ambassador in Cairo refused to take the position towards this report.
Mother's abuse "He brought himself to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her father brought a woman to kill himself.
Michael Trerise, 57 years of stithians in Cornwall, was sentenced to five years of prison after she acknowledged eight indecent arrests.
The Real de Truro Court knew that he had regularly acted with his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl had between five and seven years.
Trerise wrote in a role of confesion: "I'm responsible for his death."
The court knew that Mrs Randle was suicided in his house of Mutley in Plymouth, on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
At the time when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to shoot her and sell her eye before taking her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter was transferred to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Mrs Randle, who had spent a large part of his time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was suffered by the abuse that had been inflicted him two times a week.
In 2006, the Inspector Ramsey Quaife refered to the court what some friends of Mrs Rande had said about her, that after being a great surfing and cyclist, he now seemed to be "emotionally dead", like if he had "renumbered life".
In April 2007, her true father, Terraza Randle, found the woman who died in Plymouth's apartment.
Mrs Rande is supposed to have murdered himself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle was in front of his daughter's father, who wrote a confesion letter that was concluded, saying, "I was shooting her and sell her eyes.
It was never a sexual attack.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen responded to Trerise: "You are a very strange pheticist, and your victim must have been a surprising experience, especially when I was only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ended with the victim and left his own life.
Even more clearly, it is that if she didn't do it, the question would probably have not been finished in the courts."
And he added: "I noticed the effect that, according to the description made by the father and the mother of Stephanie, the abuse was about her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promised future, success and happiness."
A official loaded for data loss
The BBC was informed that a official of the Gabe forgotten a number of secret documents on the train in June will be accused under the Act on Official Secrets.
The man, on working trip by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the Waterloo train.
The documents were passed to BBC before they were sent to the police.
It is certainly the less serious charge under the law and does not provide any indication of the intent of crime.
The BBC Corresponsal for Defense Frank Gardner said that the condemnation had arrived as a surprise for many in the English administration.
" They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Gavine," said.
The employee, which cannot be appointed, is loaded under Section 8.1 of the Law, the clause referred to in the safeguard of information.
The Real Jurisdiction noted that the official should be accused of the Metropolitan police because of the high sensitive entity of its work in the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and security forces in Iraq.
The official was informed of the decision on Monday morning and then transferred from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B & B
In Britain, construction companies could be faced with a price of more than 800,000 esterlin libraries after the rescue/restauration of the Bradford bank and Bingley.
Indeed, the Government provided 14 billion libraries to protect the deposits of the bank's 2.6 million insurers.
The interest in the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the borrowers, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Construction Societys (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humily" that society and its members have to pay
On the other hand, the 14-million loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley hypothesis are refined.
However, the interests to be made in the IT are loaded every year to the 700 financial enterprises that have deposits.
The Financial Service Indemnization Plan confirmed the BBC that 59 building companies were included in that number.
It is humility that the institutions that have been conducted with prudence... are called to pay the price of the institutions that have been very less careful today.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is, that each company had to pay for bank deposits, and the mediation companies had to pay about 18 per cent of the cost.
The Deputy estimates that the loan interest will be 450.000 sterlin libraries in 2009.
This means that corporations will have to recover 81.000 sterlin libraries to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Trade Association of Construction Societys, declared the BBC that this situation is injust.
"It is humility that the institutions that have been fully conducted in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were very less prudent."
According to the BSA, there is no data that indicate the failure of any society since 1945.
"We will have the need to review all the aspects of this matter in the next weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction societys and their members in respect of what could be a relevant price," added Mr Cole.
The interest covered in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of demandable interests, which may be almost two times more.
As partners of mutual construction companies and without shareholders, their members will unevitablely end the price, either through higher rates or lower interests in their borrows.
The price of milk below five pens per litre
Jersey's people will have to pay more for their milk.
The journal Jersey Dairy has announced that the most precious of milk products will increase the litro from next Monday for a further five-minute.
It is the second price increase in this year, after an increase in two pensions in February and after investigations carried out by an advisory company.
Traders may decide whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the largest price of milk had increased before February, it was in 2002.
Denied the freedom under fidelity to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh court rejected the request of freedom under fidelity for the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that it may be led to prison when returning to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him the freedom under the fiance accused of extortion of $50 million ($729.700) to a entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various corruption accusions to its charge.
His long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was set free in fidelity at the beginning of this month.
The return from Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the next few weeks, but its party, the Awami Liga, has required that the Government of the country, militaryly supported, grant him first full freedom.
Correspondentals say that while the conditional freedom was given to go to the foreign and receiving medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of their release are or if it will be able to stay free when he returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will make a appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request of freedom under fidelity for Sheikh Hasina, claiming that it could not obtain freedom under fiance because he was already in treatment with the foreigner under conditional freedom," said its lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We're going to put a appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
His defenders argued that she needed the freedom under fidelity to return to her country from the foreign country and to prepare for the elections of December.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her patriarch after October 17, as a leader of the Awami Liga last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provincial government, supported by the army, took the power, but was placed in June to go to the foreign and receiving medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all the charges they are accused.
The fears for the campaign against Poliomiliti in Afghanistan
About 200,000 children in Afghanistan - says the United Nations - have not been able to benefit from a recent antipoliomiliation campaign because of the violence of the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations has conducted a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reported that children could not be reached in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in South for security reasons.
One United Nations porter said that it had happened despite the promises made by the Talibans that would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while they carried out vaccinations.
BSkyB lost legal challenge in ITV
BSkyB had lost its legal challenge in the Commission of Competence after the decision that the company was able to reduce its participation in the radio-distribution ITV rival.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competence Appeals Court to reduce its participation of 17.9% in ITV below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB interests hinder competitiveness and enabled their unlawful influence on ITV.
BSkyB purchased its actions package in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL now Virgin Media in purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopolio Office reported that the acquisition of ITV's participation by BSkyB was weakened with doubts about the independence of ITV, and encouraged the Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin's chief, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom regulator were opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was not reasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedie, particularly because, said BSkyB, it would have delivered its vote rights.
New investigation in the meeting of U.S. lawyers
The United States Advocate General has appointed a special appeal to investigate the discharge of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The reason was that the general inspector of the Department of Justice criticized the action by the administration officials.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, the legislators and the former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed by political reasons.
The Special Prosecutor Nora Anakehy is investigating whether the interrogated officials during the investigation have held investigators in the attempt to obstaculize justice.
"Clair complaints of possible criminal conduct have not been completely investigated or resolved," the General Prosecutor Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special applicant with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The debate began when nine American lawyers were removed from their duties by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision suggesting that lawyers had been discharged by low performance.
However, later it was known that lawyers had not been assessed worse than other colleagues of their colleagues, and many observers concluded that discharges would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers concerned had worked in the persecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of the Congress, while others had refused to investigate the complaints of electoral fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and judicial cases for the Government
and may be disappointed at any time, but not removed by political reasons.
The next Chief of the Department of Justice, Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure for dispatchs, rejected his position.
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice did the same.
The report of the Prosecutor General is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in this matter, and stressed how he had a "prior responsibility" for the dispatchs, which "abduced" of his leadership position and was "notably non-cooperative" in the process.
Other officials, and among them, Karl Rove, the former Co-operator of Bush, were criticized because they did not cooperate with the research.
The epic of Meat Loaf of great honour
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored in the Q Awards for its epic ring Bat Out Of Hell.
The songer, who will collect the special prize the next week in the ceremony that will take place in London, said that obtaining this recognition will be "a honor".
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, constituted the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triunfed in 1977.
The Coldplay Group is taking candidates to the premiums of this year and make the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, the editor of the Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that overcome time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them. "
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal capacity as used by Meat Loaf.
A instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the heavy.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and began to be number 15 in the classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained about nine years in the classifications and began to sell more than 40 million copies throughout the world.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation for his heart arthmia in 2003, after a fall during a concert.
In 2007, a huge laringite forced him to cancel some concisers.
Afterward, it appeared that he had a chest in his voice round.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and maybe ready to sell
The city of New York has thousands of adventures, bulvars, streets and other ways, some famous, other simple service.
However, to many, including veteran taxists and long-term local residents, it is difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends the north of the First Calle – before I found the Second Calle - between the Bowery and the Second Avenida.
This rueach, more than 30 feet width and 120 of length, is situated to a powdery rueджon more than a active way.
There are no signs.
It is almost impossible to find in a rat.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings in the Premier Calle
which wants to repair Extra Place and create a clean shop to shops and shops that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old date neighbors that they began to be loved by the trunked cart simply because it is one of the last remains of the block before the suitability of the buildings.
However, the Department of Living, Preservation and Development of the city, which has the rule control, has no interest in possessing it.
At the meeting of the Vencidad Community Committee for the use of the land this month, the representatives of the Avalon Agency made a proposal for purchase the road.
However, by prefering the street remaining in the city, the Committee requested a new plan to be presented in the next month, as Susan Stetzer, the Community district manager. 3.
"The city is propietary today of very few spaces, and we would like to continue to have extra Place," said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to address the problem and to manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install a few seats, including some to be used as a coffee, in the expectation of requiring spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first occurred during the meeting of this month
But Michele de Mily, a port of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, he would not necessarily have it.
"The primary concern of Avalon Bay is the renewing of this abandoned street and the possibility of converting it into a public area," said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a chairman of the Reservation Committee, confirmed that it was a desire from the city to sell the street and noted that the Agency's mission was the development of the property more than the management.
In comparison with its more color surroundings, the Bowery's Bowery, Extra Place has left a sleeve in the history.
Some believed that he obtained his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great ownership was shared between his children and this extreme land strike was not claimed by anyone.
The behind door of the CBGB, the rock rock monument that closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place, but the street may be better known by the photo of the establishment that comes in the cup of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," commented Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who issued the photo in November 1976.
"I was filled with bubbles, clothing pieces and pieces of barriles, cards, sheets, clouds."
Some residents, including bloggers who write on East Village's accommodation, have opposed the idea to sell Extra Place, arguing that the public, still modest goods, must continue to be public.
Others have joyed Extra Place as rare pieces, almost without changes, a king of the city that should be protected.
Jeremías Moss, who directs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a city in the Going Extinct process"), has made a part of a charla of the city's history on Extra Place, published by the newspaper The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little close and unexpected street, dark, also for the day and marked by the doors of oxided and counterventure, with old weekly newspapers over the channels."
With a few exceptions, the street seemed to be more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat was closed through the back of the street and stopped near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and that now takes a luxury clothes store.
Graphites on the walls and a empty bird bottle around 22-oceans were near to a new lote of disappeared newspapers.
Some passengers said that they had rarement attention to Extra Place, but they suggested that it could be cleaned.
Mr. Fields, on his part, noted that some people underscored the attractive power of the street in their current state.
"I pass the best years of my life," said, "in dark, humid and smell places."
The debate on bilinguism: inheritance in English
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discussed the positions of candidates on bilingue education.
Lance T. Izumi, a old partner in studies on California and the director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-auteur of the book "Note as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice".
Appeal to Spanish voters is a difficult business.
The proposals for education made by Barack Obama are the example of this.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "the Africans and Latin students have significantly less likely to graduate than white students" and this is a very proper consideration.
In order to combat such differences in the events of learning, Obama's educational plan specifically appealed, among other things, "the bilingual transition education" for English students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the bilingual education commitment, which prefers in school instruction in different languages from English, is effective to cancell the distance in the final results.
We take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a primary school officially recognised in the Eastern region of Los Angeles.
In this school the vast majority of students are Spanish and family with low interests:
more than a third of students, many of whom recently arrived, are learning English.
However, a surprising 100 percent of the fourth year students has been evaluated positively in the 2008 mathematics review.
and almost a very amazing 93 percent has dominated the test of English and arts.
This amazing success has been achieved using a different ingredient that has been favoured by Mr Obama.
The Sexth Street School emphasizes the review and practice, the continuing assessment of the competitives and does not tolerate any attitude of excussion.
In addition, and here is where Mr. Obama should take note, in accordance with Linda Mikels, the main of the sixth Calle, the approach of the English school to education to students is in the "total inheritance".
Inherence in English means almost exclusive use of language in the treatment of instruction contents.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingue education, said to me, "We have had extraordinary success with students as this last who has arrived from Mexico, and that if you enter the school 12 months later you would not be able to collect what it was."
"Function", she said, "We believe it works."
Will Mr Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate for other schools with large Spanish-English student populations?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the response, but the idea of their party's policy on education (National Education Associations have been long-term defenders of bilateral education) and its continuing support for bilateral education is the prediction of Mr Obama's response.
Although immigrants should learn English, Mr Obama recently trivialized the issue by allowing people to stop worried about the legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, "You must ensure that your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and closure the lagunas, it should be carefully considered the educational models that work well, more than disappoint them or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls brushly after the renewed economic fears
The price of oil was drastically decreased this month because of the concern that the American rescue plan for financial markets can not be able to reactivate the economy.
Cross oil actions reduced from 7 percent, reaching $99.80 the barriel in the morning negotiation in New York Market Exchange.
The price has decreased more than $20 per barrill since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, the basic products markets have been covered by the financial crisis in Wall Street and a couple of powerful huracans in the Golf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barriel in July, prices had fallen nearly $90 by barrill at the beginning of this month before returning, once again, because of the great incertitude in the financial markets.
The anxiety was supported by the investors, once again, the Monday, despite the leaders of the Congress that they said had arrived in an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the biggest in the history.
The news was underlined by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far away.
The evolution in the last episode of the fusion process confirms that the City Group will buy the Wachovia Corporation bank operations, as the Government said this Monday.
While the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalized the Fortis European Financial Conglomeration.
Analysts in Barclays Capital said, in the frenetic end of the week, the negotiations that leaded to the rescue agreement "saired not have been able to reactivate the feeling of the market".
As the economic situation is deteriorate, the demand of basic products, including oil, is expected.
"The perspectives for global equity, the interest rate and change will be increasingly incerted," the German Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that basic products can't escape this account.
From the perspective of products, our more accurate concern is the evaluation if the American virus will be distributed globally and specifically to China. "
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, such as oil consumption because of the crisis in economic growth, and the predictation of oil and gas price reduction is 20 per cent for 2009.
Second locure room: team set record
After passing, during the last eight times, more time than anyone in the uniform of Jets, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw how things are developed in the second fourth this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without anotation in a game of desinflaring.
"I have never seen anything like that," she commented.
The second fourth began after the Jets and the Cardinal Arizona had played with perience under the clouds.
At this time, the fourderback Brett Favre found in Laveranues Coles by performing a half of 12 miles and suggesting the perfect strike for a late, in which the evolution of relationship between players had a great slope forward.
You should find Coles for two more targets in the room, one of them when a cornerback falls and the other arrived with 10 seconds in half.
"I didn't go out of my way," said Favor of all steps that went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were played in the ship, the defense of the Cardinals was untreated to the Quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a staircase and returned 32 pounds to a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another step and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss Warner.
In the last turn, Bowens' lacks, could have been the best.
The Cardenals had taken the possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets returned the ballon, Jay Feely gave him a 20-millions to win a definitive 34-0.
It's the biggest points that the Jets never did in a room.
To the team trainer, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the laugh of this moment, said, "The second room or the third room?"
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 points without reply in the third - Mangini said, "I can say that I enjoyed the second fourth more than the territories.
They won a lot of points in a very short time period."
Baxterlasie heads its world record
Once again, Haile Berserlasse of Ethiopia has demonstrated that many consider him the greatest runner of history, over their own world record in the Berlin Marathon this Sunday and become the first person who can run the car at 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory of the swimming carriage at 2:03:59, Bergerlassie has destroyed by 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Bursellas has established the global record number 26 in a pressing long-term road, so that it has established a global campeonate or a global record for any distance, from the contrary road to the marathon.
Last month, Burselassie did not take part in the olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarming - that the pollution of the air would raise its problems with the asthma.
Instead, he was put to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - solar and with 48 degrees when the cart begins, 55 degrees at the end - Burselassie wins this Sunday, using in average some 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since stroke flights such as Burserlassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo from Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the victory of the last Sunday, Burserlassie told the journalists that he had suffered disasters in the panoracle two weeks ago and that he had lost a week of training.
It is obvious that the suspension has left him fresh, not oxided.
"I'm very happy," Burselassie said to the journalists.
"It was all perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but at the end everything was fine."
The atleta has been subject to some critical - especially in Kenya, the Afro-East Rival of Ethiopia - for the style of shooting too much, generally, avoiding the meeting with many stars of the world marathon, based on the brands as if it would be treated by a trail track, and putting the records in front of the sense of competition.
But this critical does not decrease the size of Bursellassi's ability as a corridor.
This Sunday, at the loop of four Kenaians, Burselash reached half of the carriage at 1:02:04.
Two elite flights from Kenia, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to disappoint Burselassie after their brandpasses were decreased.
But short before three miles of the meta, Burselassie tried a last impuls to separate Kwambai, which ended in 2:05:36, enhancing its best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi came to the third place in 2:07:48.
In the women's career, Irina Mikitenko, born of Kazajsthan but now German citizens, completed a notable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in the history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain has the world record 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36 years of age, was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She did not participate in the Beijing Games for what was described as a lesson in the shooting, but he was recovered to win in Berlin and to establish its best personal record in almost five minutes in the third marathon that flyed.
I made a intelligent calculator car, left a fourth of the Kenan and Ethiopian corridors to make a head and, then, get them back after 18.11.42 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second place at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished from third to 2:25:01.
In a separate city, the pride and the tests of color life
Hidden by the expansion of the park on the subject of the Great Orlando, just a few kilometers of the brilliant, rude and colonal city, there is a peaceful people, where the pride and complications of African experience are very clear.
Eatonville, the first town completely inhabited by blacks in the country and the place of Zora Neale Hurston's childhood, is no longer so simple as she described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three crowd fields, 300 color men, 300 good smokers, many guayaba, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a place of peregrination.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the Year Zora year!Fire in Eatonville to take home to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem's Renaissance.
However, in many senses, the city which she described – also a tourist stage through its inclusion in the guide of Florida’s travels produced by the Federal Writers Project of Depression Time - remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignity and private as it was in the 1930s when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted to share their real ideas with the white man, "what she knows so little about us and that doesn't know what to lose."
Even now, in the year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to start a dialogue on the matter of race, many continue to be disappointed against the outside.
"We are very careful about the way our history is counted," said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, was a resident of the whole life and member of the oldest church in the city.
"I have to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined a triunfo paradox and struggle.
At the same time, a historical model of the declaration of blacks and a community of almost 2.400 people living under a double level of national media.
It is a literary centre, but also a reparated example of the rural culture of the southern black - sometimes blessed, other joyful - born from slavery in America.
It is not strange if those who live here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern of the image of Eatonville really began by Zora, as nobody here calls you Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her birth city to the world through its deep books in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, only outside the 17th Rue, a road that runs through the centre of Florida often forgotten towards the history of blacks and the human drama.
Having a grace in life as well as in literature, Mrs. Hurston brought his readers to the ownership shop of the first chain of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then in more private areas.
"Found from the left to hand," wrote, "you have the modern public school with its white ends, his good gardens and game pats, care for Howard Miller, how he can only read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the Dash widow and writes that Glenn Lee "sell drinks of all kinds and anything is going to with transitional rooms".
Thus, in so many hundreds of words, Mrs. Hurston is in relation to Eatonville with the autonome government, but also with analfabetism, second marriage and sex.
Obviously this Fodor did not.
In fact, not all the people appealed the retirement.
"He described this way out," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs. Hurston inmortally quoted men who were sing without color songs about their beauty.
He added, "A few people did not like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a living excentric that has often returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77 years old, remembered that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in the city, he did it without warning in a great Chevrolet, smoking and bringing pants to a city that is still proud of clothing with dignity.
The majority of the residents remained fascinated, Mr Franklin said, while many were sarcastically riding.
"The people always enjoy seeing Zora," continues Mr. Franklin.
But, add, balanced in his seat in a backward shock with view on the Sabelian Lake, where Ms. Hurston was probably baptized, "he never remained too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books weren't already in stamping.
As most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although it was a literary star, a contemporaine of Langston Hughes and the only color woman in the Barnard College in the 20 ’ s, it was entered in a anonymous tube in Fort Pierce - Florida, where he was living.
In Eatonville, there were no big conmemorative ceremony, nor major public readings.
"I don't think that her contribution to the world or heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography by Mrs Hurston published in 2003.
A certain virgin arrived in the 80s.
Orange officers wanted to put five carriages through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, two main carriles in the work community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already moved the Interstat 4 through the western border of the city.
The proposal came at a moment when Eatonville was recovered from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended to him relatively idolal isolation of the community.
In the ‘50s ’, the fight for racial mixture led hatred about the community.
"When that time, a group of white boys went through the city to shoot naranjas and every thing against the people who were sit on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"They also killed a girl once.
They slaughtered them against a car sand."
In a letter dated 1955 to Mrs. Hurston wrote to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticing the strong integration of the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. the Board of Education, "speaked instead of honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the disaggregation of schools, positive in some aspects, had debilited Eatonville's cohesion and undermined their youth's trust.
"The black children were habituated to be abroaded - I agreed about this – it was usually to awake the teacher for the morning and evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a organization without purposes of lunch.
This duration, added, until teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wouldn't raise your teacher because it was white - there's a cultural fraction there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Citizen rights, however, helped to create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who were passing above the prejudices, as she did, with friendly, confidence and lines such as: "Why can anyone reject the joy of my company?
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous tube of Ms. Hurston and began to fight to resurrected her reputation.
Five years later, a pleasant biography of Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in books, retroducing her into the American channels.
The road project came just at the moment when the most famous daughter of Eatonville was again under the reflectors.
And this time, old neighbors of Mrs. Hurston saw her as a salvador.
In 1988, the community began planning a feast for Ms. Hurston to show what the county could break with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived to the inaugural event two years later, and each January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the chain has left its proposal for the road.
"The resurrected idea of the road to five ways, would have been put on what you would call curvature speed, a true citizen pride," said Mrs Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd said so simplerly, "He saved Eatonville."
The victory on the road project has helped to change the image of the city.
Outside people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to the church of here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and the residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National History Register in 1998.
A new library (the name of Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, about a rewriting and pleasant Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomaly in Florida: only six miles from the centre of Orlando, it may sometimes feel like in a past street under a summer rain, in a small city that was found only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Forests that come in search for the history of Eatonville, of their meaning, often are still treated with caution.
To an advanced permission is necessary to make the majority of interviews, and some things - such as the walls in the oldest church of Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working on the field - can not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs Jones, a valuable and convinced teacher who has deficiency for the brilliant red, still fears that your island community may be uninterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, there has also been a higher birth pride level.
Young people, in particular, intend to see Eatonville as Mrs. Hurston saw all his race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, no better, and also to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, worker, tongue and mixta.
It is a sincere civic sense that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey's 18-year-old cousin, who will be planned to return to Eatonville after the university to work in the local government or the police department, which said it might need help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old men of Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"The majority of people, if they are going to go to this place, must think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other," says Alondra Kenon after going to the church in a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at her story, it's a very nice city."
For here, in New York, everyone speaks correctly of funding
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan remain far away from the quies and the gigantic television screens in Times Square, they would not be aware of being found in the eyes of the huracan.
They could never imagine that behind the vision fashion of the offices to the swimming pool, which are located above their heads, bankers and spectacular fund managers that monopolis New York face daily with the worst "may day of the office" from the bath of 1929.
Kids for the home delivery continue to resume their metal carts to the tea through the oceans and carrying muffins bands for lunch meetings.
Latin men continue to drake between the loaded apartments buildings, as human begins, with 50 extreme stamping shops shocked to a jewel through their shadows. The office workers are still waiting for their food for the morning to take, and it is still impossible to cover a taxi between 4 and 7 afternoon in the working days.
Employees are still expected to make a bagel for the saler's cart, and it is yet impossible to find a taxi between four and five afternoon in the week's day.
I looked like if there was no crisis in absolute, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pesimism predictions that there are, I decided to open a new account of horses.
Although he had calculated the time necessary to comply with the rest of the night in my local branch JP Morgan Chase, a collar of more or less than 20 people had already been waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to remove their effective or to make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where customers in the whole life order their cheques households, tourists are looking for instructions to go to Macy's large stocks and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people were before me, I was later informed by Starr, my "reliable personal bank", and they were in colle for the same reason I was.
Unlike me, they had already removed their upsets from the smallest banks in places from where they had changed them, places such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the state island.
They had thrown their money from the so-called shore associations (as a company of construction), credit unions and boxes of their birth city whose whites work only in the state of belonging, and who say to treat customers as well.
In the past year, 15 of these banks have failed silently.
In the last days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 million, entered in the kitchen, and as neo-yorquians were heading to their homes on Wednesday for the end of the week, another bank, Wachovia, with some $440 million, they would search for a rescue buyer.
The office workers and shops that were standing before me, fearing another failure, were transferring their money to a bank, which is considered a safe refuge, which is the majority of the rescues in Wall Street.
New York's ordinary persons have been converted in the last weeks to financing experts.
A woman in my local supermarket Chinese, speaking by phone, refers to Lehman Brothers, the failure of the bank, and his executive director of an afflicted aspect, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter with a familiarity as if it was deceived by the inactivity of a colleague.
And Lyn, the fifty-first and something in uniform of my apartments block, has changed the normal roll of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my purchase at the tent.
He said to me, after my visit to the bank, "I have all my funds on the monetary market.
Commutation is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Muslim tumbs profaned at the time Austria is close to the right
Heinz-Cristian Strache, from the left side of the extreme right party for the freedom of Austria and the Belgian Philip Dewinter, affiliated to the extreme right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a manifestation to submit to the organization "Cittàs against Islamization" in Amberes, July 17, 2008.
Leave traffic signals representing the mixtures with a red line that crosses.
Police is guilty of extremists of extreme right-hand right because they have prostituted a Muslim cementary in Austria, the same weekend as the political parties of the extreme right side have made huge profits in the general elections of the country.
More than 90 tumbles were severely damaged in the Traun cementary near Linz, at some time between Wednesday and morning, in which the police believed that it was an organised action.
The criminals rolled Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David about some of the tumbs, but investigators believe that this may have occurred by trying to hide the real reasons of extremists stimulated by hatred against Islamic immigrants.
It is not clear if the incident was in any way related to elections.
A local Islamic community porter said that they were "deeply shocked" by the propanation news, which came to the Muslim religiouss when the month was finished.
At the same time, Austria is preparing a round of introspection after the right tour in the parliamentary elections of yesterday.
The two extreme right-right partys that were closed to almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for Austria had conducted a focused campaign in the anti-immigration age and some of their slogans were considered to be xenofobos by critics.
Heinz-Cristian Strache, the leader of the Libertad Partie who won more than 18 percent of the vote, made his campaign against the head pupils and the burkas, and moreover, expressed its opposition to the foods considered in relation to Islam.
In his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European hero" to prevent Islam's emergency.
Both parties try to prohibit the construction of mixtures and mines, arguing that they were symbols of the current Islamic policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the strongest political block of the country, indicate that the change was mainly made by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel prohibition for Gary Glitter
The courts forbidden to Gary Glitter, the fascinant star of guest rock for children's sexual abuse, to travel to France and Spain.
The judges imposed Glitter a prohibition of six months after he informed the supervisory authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
The police of Kent made the prohibition of traveling to foreign on Thursday after the magistrates had produced the evidence of the previous convictions of Glitter for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates Judge in Kent, but was represented by the lawyer Corker Binning.
A port of the Judge Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September, at the Court of Ashford Masters in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s travellers to the foreign as to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities who wanted to travel to the foreign, as a result of the registration of sexual offences.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel to the foreign for more than three days
and it is also necessary to report to the police the date expected by seven days of prior exit.
Kent's police said he wouldn't discuss the individual case or the possible stopping place of Glitter at the gate.
A police porter said: "Kent's police will do everything to protect children in this country or in the foreign country.
A police porter said: "Kent's police will do everything to protect children in this country or in the foreign country.
"In our view, it is easier to monitor someone remaining in the UK because we are here the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protection to the inhabitants of Kent is the main concern of the police and we work closely in cooperation to monitor the behavior of sexual offenders registered in the county and to reduce at least any risk that can exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after passing 27 months in a Vietnami prison for the abuse of two girls, with age of 10 to 11 years.
When Glitter was released, he fled to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he was ill and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through the pass control and finally flighted to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to enter him, and he flyed back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on returning to Britain.
He probably came to Heathrow's terminal on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker was to the Uxbridge Court of Magistrates, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as sexual offence.
Glitter had been incarcerated in the UK for four months in 1999 for children ' s abuse images.
One source of the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacques Smith, the Minister of Interior, was quiet and pleased to know that they were prohibited Glitter to travel to France and Spain.
"Master's head outside scene to extract his character" Sunther Bauer_Photograph
No balls, no flights, nor shops of stars.
The essence of the great teachers of the flamenco, displaced from the concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On one side, the artist.
Another one, the person.
Unfairly saved in the intimity, in those moments you go to the public, when you find the privacy of a shooting, the depth of a shocked look or the extremity of hands, disappointed because they will not get out of scene.
The German Sunther Bauer alternate in "Flamenco-people" the theatrality of some in scene with songs, dancings and guitarists with the least known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photograph collects the particular iconography of the flamenco from various areas.
Incl. in the programmement of the Photophoto Flamenca, the exhibition "reflexes the international importance of flamenco, most day" explains the creator, who claims that "Flamenco-people" can be people but, when seeing the photos, the observer is not the typical images of artists in the scenario.
These people "in the street" are artists who are able to transmit to the scene of patience, tristeness, joy... safeguarding the public.
To capture the personality of these artists there are no photos from the scenario.
Take your personality and character inside.
What I interested was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the largest flamenco."
With the sabor of the "Cant des Minas" Festival, Bauer began in 1.997 a long trip to turn the songers, guitarists or dancers with a plate room.
They are retrats that, due to the selection of the camera and material, remember the classic photo.
The application of various structural media breaks with the classic basis of the image, trusting it in modernity, the idea that reflects how Bauer itself understands the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day."
It's not the action of the dance, the song or the touch in itself, but the personality of the artist, its character, which causes with its art to the public.
Search of a meeting with the essential, with the doubt that is visible in a way of feeling, being and being, and have been the constant work that presents these days in the El Fotomata gallery.
Unknown figures of the flamenco such as Dego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebriyano, Antonio Canales, Vicente friend, among others, set this selection of almost seventeen photod artists.
The project has been converted to an antology of the flamenco, which will soon be published in a book which will collect the spectrum posts.
The passion of Bauer's race led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTProject" (SportARTProject).
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photograph admits that "I like to turn people, know them and can enter a moment in your life, it is a long or short moment.
I think in the photo the path is the hardest gender.
You find or face people, persons, that you don't know, or they leave you just a few minutes to get the photo.
Despite these circumstances, like photography, I always try to make my ideas realized."
This collection of the current flamenco retreats that leads to the title "Flamenco-people" is shown in the Galaia El Fotomata, located on Number 20 of the Mata Street, parallel to the Hercules Alamed, where it can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the news that writes is "a fear"
It is surrounded in places that are still not known and seen about unknown matters, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is able to get out the new project in which he works, a news that has as a protagonist to Roger Casemant, a Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through Amazon.
The always favorite Nobel Prize of Literature condemned in his pass by the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today is "that's a worst" and that "all indicates that it should not write" the news.
"If I was sensitive, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I hope it will ever end," concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days have seen passing through the city of the Auditor to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The city and the dogs" was one of the figures highlighted in the third edition of the word party and complied the prognostics.
Vargas Llosa, who wins the premium There is Festival for being the most voted writer by the participants - an ancient edition of "Our mutual friend", of Dickens-, filled the lowest of the theatre Juan Bravo.
Pronounced by Felix Romeo, found a public delivered to him very shortly the time in which the Peruvian, with a slight memory and with great doses of humor, recovered how he born his literary vocation, resulting in the "extrordinary aventure" of "lear" and "living more than what he lived"; how writes of "disciplined manner" to fill his "illusion flow" with a intense documentation work, correcting and refusing; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandromas had influenced his vocation and what "image of memory" is the basis that his history is based.
The Spanish newslist acknowledged that "no way" is to measure and to know if books change life, "but I don't believe that literature is a pure entertainment, a eyemera experience," emphasized Vargas Llosa, who said that this is "having effects" and "it makes people most incomplete", so he asked the writers "not leave to the competitiveness" and "assuming responsibilities" their vocation.
Climateology takes Pozoblanco's feast, which also remains unrejourable
The celebration of horns that closed the abono of Pozoblanco feast was suspended in the morning of yesterday, after verifying the advertising residents that the placing floor was not found in the best conditions.
Thus, the company, in accordance with Ferdin Bohrquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the flight celebration.
The meteorological inclinations have been thrown with this feast, since two of their three feasts have finally not been able to celebrate.
The Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned tower flight.
The card composed of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a Castilblanco lock.
So, just the Wednesday, there was a party.
In him, the triumphant was Daniel Luke who cut three ears and went out to shadows, after leaveing passes with sweet and ethical.
That same late, Alejandro Talvannte went out of his two sides with health and a prayer, which gave more tendencies than his tore.
Yes, the worst was The Juli, who passed through the sweet of Los Llanos without punishment and glory.
In his second tour, after a fence of relief, the brochure of a large part of the public was gathered.

5 less than 10 of the mature.
Traffic control in the urban term of Armingón (Alava).
The agents give the two busy busy, and they're going to flee.
Your load, more than two tons of hachy, was not like to stop.
The agents persecuted them and stopped one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., reported in a communication by the Department of Interior of the Vash Government.
The arrested person has been accused of drug trafficking and public documentation.
The incident was registered when several officials of the Arab Traffic Unit carried out a control of transport in N-1, on his step through the municipal term of Armiñon.
They were disabled to stop a truck for their inspection when the driver dismissed the commands, accelerated brushly and shooted the control.
The agents started their persecution until the vehicle was stopped a couple of miles later in the arc, when their two occupants were shocked to run the road through a forest area.
The ursaines finally endeavoured one of them and entered up from the 2.178 kilograms of haches that transported and found after inspecting the furgonet, a Iveco Daily.
The next part of the vehicle was loaded of haches fat, so they moved to police dependencies to an exhaustive and weak inspection of the drug.
In addition, officials confirmed that the matrix had been "duplicate" because it did not correspond to the collection of the carton documentation, so that the arrest was also sent to an offence of public documentation.
Ertzaintza continues to investigate to detention of the other suspect, which has been able to flee to the car, as has been said, and to determine the origin of the previous drug.
The detentor, A.A. J., of 28 years, was transferred to police dependances to carry out relevant diligences and will take place in the next hour.
Stop the Heather Locklear act to drive under the effects of any medicine
Actor Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) to drive under the effects of some medicine.
A testimony saw doing strange manuscripts when trying to get out of his shopping in Montecito, according to the magazine People a portion from the California road patrol.
The testimony has detailed that at 16:30 hours, Locklear "I was shooting the accelerator down, making a lot of smile, trying to get out of the parking car upward and behind, and after walking back, it passed several times above its sun snakes."
Shortly later, the Witness, who, when he looked at the beginning, had not recognized the actor, saw that Locklear stopped in a nearby autopsist and went out of the vehicle.
This person warned the emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police's patrol came, he found the actor sit inside his vehicle, which was shutting partly the road.
"It was disorientated," so the agents brought her to the specialized center of drugs and alcohol to carry out a test.
According to a police portion, the actor has been cooperative and the excess of alcohol has been discarded since the first time, although "as the officials first observed, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of any medicine."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect to drive under the effects of any substance that has not been specified and entered into local prison at 19:00 p.m. although it was in freedom some hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was out of Arizona’s treatment clinic where it was recovery of an anxiety episode and depression.
Calls calls for the Future Federation of the UU to take its competence in the Silva case
The General Coordinator of IU and Deputy of the Unida Izquererda, Gaspar Llamazares, has assured today that it will be the regional federation of the training that should take a decision on the case of the former concept of Youth and Sports of the Helping of Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who decreased the last week after being accused of conducting families.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the exciting organization that you have to take its competences," said Challars on the action that the party must take with which until now designed in the sevillan composer.
However, the IU leader declared that the need for "transparency" to be presented in the possible investigations on irregularities that Silva could have done: "I have always defended that this type of matters have the maximum degree of transparency."
At the same time, he stressed that the training had "strict ethical codes for all public charges".
May's Sand', Garci's epic appeal
In spite of the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdoos, José Luis Garci recruits the famous resurrection of the Spanishs against the Frenchs in Sangre de May, which is the most ambitious film in its film with about 15 million euros of budgets.
Thus, the cinema has tried to "illustrate the torrent of persons and the social analysis" which has always admired in the work of the known newslist, explained today during the presentation of the kin, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevar would be in front of a wide list of interpretes.
May blood, with a metro above two and a half hours, is shocked this Wednesday in cinematographic rooms to become a ministery for Telemadrid over four hours of duration.
The great admirant of the literature of Galdos, José Luis Garci assured that he had fulfilled this round "un son of child," which should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community three years ago engaged him to roll a conmemorative cemetery for the second centuries of May 2, which has always accepted and when the story was based on the National Episodes.
The total of 15 million budgets of the Madrid Community are for Garci a "single opportunity" to environmentate with the decorations and the suitable clothing of "A A Atolond Spain that was equipped to fight, since the fight for independence led to the people to a great delay with the kingdom of Fernando VII".
But the cinema regrets that he did not have counted with a financing such as Alatrist or Goya's fans - more than double of the Sangre de Mayo -, so he couldn't roll some plasma scenes in a guide signed along with Horacio Valcarcel, with whom he has cooperated in almost all his car.
Hence, the director of Return has incitated the ordinary form of work, set up with the actors, with whom it usually tried before starting the wheel, and those who do not caught, by viewing it "humillante" and considering that "Part of the office of the director stays in acquiring the theatre and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which it works".
Many of the interviews that match in Sangre of May retain before their camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
The candidate to Oscar in four occasions - from which he won a -, Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, its own Sangre of May, Seven French bill tables, and finally selected, the blind tours, are not representing a young generation of Spanish cinema, "what is what must be known," has assured.
With this film Garci does not expect premises.
"In the beginning you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that you're only working for prosperity, and now you agree with making a more film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional trayectory.
Isabel Bayon restore the essence of the sevilla dance Tortola Valencia
A sevillan bathroom will home to a sevillan bathroom too.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, father of catalan (Flornance Turtola Ferrer) and his mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in Triana's barrier, and three years of age moved to London with his family.
It was a free dance dance dance dance in Eastern dance.
There was a pleasant life, a pioneer from the liberation of women, such as Isaac Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was buddhist and vegetarian and abomined for the abolition of the corse that prevented the free women's movement.
The life of this woman that marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars, made Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed me this character and looked incredible."
According to the ballet, "We do not want to tell his life, but to collect his spirit.
The titles of their dance suggested me a flamenco ball.
So, "the dance of the marijuana" suggested me a giant, or "the snack's dance" a few tanks.
His dance was sensitive, and my dance has said to me that my dance is also inside this esthetic", says.
The mount has two exceptional cooperations: the de Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one of its shows, as he did in the "Open door"; and with the master Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally wanted to cooperate with whom he was outside his school.
"Matilde does Tortola, the personality of the mature.
I am happy because you have accepted acting in my work and I feel very honored for it."
The assembly also accounts with the musical and guitars composition of Jesus Torres and Peace Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, Puga and Moi de Morón; the persecution of El Pajaro, as well as the violation of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of a actor, Juanfra Juárez, "what does the role of the eternal composer of this type of artists that were divine in all their extension, and they are always loving of them."
In the work, there are also some ways of life of this woman that has been developed in so far away places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to all Europe, as it was normally in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it's of those women who have a huge influence in a certain time and now nobody knows and makes it much less valued in their work," says Bayon.
The spectacle will start today at 20.30 p.m. in the Vega Lope Teater.
The publication of the "Journal of a newly married poet" also closes the Trienium
The presentation of the first edition of the "Journal of a Poeta Reciencated" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Joan Ramon Jiménez was married to Zenobia in March 1916, is marked within the activities of the Council of Cultural Board of Andalucia to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized in order to remember the fifth anniversary of the conception of the Nobel Literature Prize and the falling of both.
In this way, the "Trinia Zenobia and John Ramon" ended with the reedification of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Museo del Nobel House, and with the enthusiasting exhibition "Johan Ramon Jiménez: That light shooting," which was inaugured last May and, after traveling through the different travel provinces, will be expected to travel to New York during the transition of the International Congress.
The Council of Andalucia also acquired a total of eight hundred examples of the "Journal of a Poeta Reciencated", edited by Peter Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal travel poets.
America is less liked without Paul Newman
"Atimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from the actor Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausenance of Maliciousness", and gives the idea of the U.S. cinema disappointment, and from all America, to the influenced idea that Newman has gone.
Look that you cost to give him a Oscar.
And that's gone since 2007.
And I knew I was very sick.
That's how it's been a mass for everyone.
"Atimely what a feeling is beyond all the expressions, and I have now lost a great friend," sweared Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
Nobody was afraid to make the smile or exagering.
There was a father of China and the Patriarch in a specially dark moment, fearing terrorists and markets, with the American self-stimate by the grounds, looking for desperate reasons for dignity.
When so hard is the time and without fail the men and little bears to admire you to stay, it doesn't necessarily be Luis Cernada to love Paul Newman.
I was incarned for everyone a ideal almost platonic of beauty and reality.
He was formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defenseer of lost and winned causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his first gentleman died by overdoses until his case and organic food mark.
A whole gift to a country that has costs to overcome a suicide food culture.
The expansive wave of the admiration bar Hollywood without taking attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the English English Daniel Craig, found that he didn't died a man but a era.
Another English director Sam Mendes said that working with Newman was no longer than the top of his career.
The bad boy coming from Australia, Russell Crowe, was to call Newman his most inspiration.
"We have left the very high list to all," observed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are trying to live as Paul Newman lived: maintaining a high chance requirements and have a serious and distant private life from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even impossible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone to try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He was divorced once, but then I was married to Joanne Woodward for 50 years, which was faithful when he certainly overwhelmed the opportunity to not be it.
"But for what I'm going to eat a hamburger out of the house, if I've got a sweet inside?" I was smiling himself.
In the heavens it was the pride that his daughters in the earth correspond to their fans, something that isn't so common in America.
"For all the major roles he explained, no one was so proud of both of the devoted husband, loved father, solitated grandmother and dedicated philantropus," they say.
The imperfect cart of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that they celebrate some olimpied in Madrid and, after the fall of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask, are we ready?
If we follow the example of the work of yesterday, I say no!
The perfect career called it, and my judgment has been the worst career in which I was.
An unpropositive pillar that, since then, if they have taken into account as a evaluation, and I would examine, it would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go through parts and from the beginning.
The deprovals start with the dorsal collection, which makes you have to go before.
What doesn't seem bad, but if you're already going to give it everything (including the chip to avoid shoes in the cart).
Well, no.
Here they did you just go to collect the dorsal (only unpropositive, go only for that) and (for the relevant collar), sought!, there was only the 'S' s for the shore (speaking, because I need a XL ball)
In what world we live?
Or did they have decided to buy only smaller shops with less sweet and cheap?
Well, things like these are a mine compared to the day of the car.
Besides having to go very early to collect the chip, the collar when reaching is of 15 minutes and there is also need to leave the skin.
More than 35 minutes longed the wait, something incomprehensible for a car where more than 11.000 people are expected.
Then, as he had to wait, he started the cart, and we had not left the mochila, although once achieved, the collection was worse.
Furthermore, the rain led the waiting over 40 minutes, which joined with popular rebellion contacts and attacked the box.
I think about 500 people surely tomorrow we'll have pulmony, and some like me, they won't even appear with the right time in the classification, because of the chip who told me that, I imagine, it didn't mark me out correctly.
Since then, if you asked me for the perfect care, this would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we'll continue to dream with a well prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft Search Recipient (virtual)
In the Microsoft Emergent Technology Conference, a new human image recognition and interaction system, a species of artificial intelligence without a lot of intellectuality, but has been able to carry out some basic tasks, such as requesting a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move by the company's camp) by listening to what is listening to the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remembering what they're taking place - and listening to and understanding the key words of their conversations.
To group presents according to the discussion groups.
In the sample video, the receptive detects a third person but understands that it does not belong to the group that is talking to it and that it is not a company employee.
She asked if he's there to visit someone and tell him that he'll take him soon.
Everything's blue screen.
Incredibly.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has best things in which it is focused, for example in the next version of its operational system, Windows.
This week has been very talking about a strategic change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and you don't have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers come with the prestigible instead of commercial loads, they would be five times faster - man, Steve, will be for less.
Everything finding that Microsoft, after version, has added functions and "extra" to Windows.
The change of the rubber is grateful.
Microsfot has the right, the operational system will lose importance, and also the software.
When Google Chrome went to the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was the first step of Google to competite with Windows.
Many have noted with awareness that a browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary because it is the necessary board to understand Hardware and software.
Fills the same role as your wife or husband when you have to tell you something to your dream.
It's true.
It will never disappear but there is no need to think about the "more" of the operational system, not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Balmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People are always less attention to the operational system, and more to the web browser.
The computer is shocked only to execute Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and each day we pass more time by navigating than in the window environment.
For what are half of the applications coming in the system?
It's less.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less, than Vista.
less weight, less reloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interesting to integrate your online services and to be an alternative to Google.
They need it desperately, in fact, and I bring a little example.
The photo of this post took it in one of the relaxing rooms for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
In the refreshing machine, a card requests you to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search on the network.
Last week, in fact, a delay was also confirmed in the new Windows Mobile version 7.
It will not be reached at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2010.
In Microsoft you will certainly search for the joint Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more computer day.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, will pass facture.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso led her into the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio lighted one in 'Diather of blood' of Edward Zwick, the same as Al Pacino in the 'Padrino' of Francis Ford Coppola, and is part of the uniform of the muscular gay paroquia.
And if we're putting a list of star appearances, we can get back to the image of that shooting snake that led weight in a ambulant circle.
In fact, it's not more than the typical men's inner shoes in wood, ceñed and without food.
The 'tank', which calls the speaking angle, but the Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels depicts on all others.
First, for his rewarding name - although familyly you know it as 'Marcel' - you have to see with the sport because it receives his name, according to the legendary, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, who loves the songer Edith Piaf.
'The Marcel' emphasizes on the others by its excellent cocktail, by its unix court, by its distinctive shooting and by the small Belgian flag (as well as recognizable) that the most emblematical shoes models lead as details in the shoe.
And care, because the production of the Belgian signature is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college boxers, back boxers, boxers of cafes, cotton pants, marine shops, babies, mini shorts...
Take thoughts for the comfort to underwear.
Although it's a pain to leave them as an internal clothing.
They're too nice.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry."
His great appearance with his sister has not prevented you to develop his own personality.
Monique Cruz is wide but full of vitality.
Cruz’s sisters are now very seriously taking their new activity in mode.
For Monica, they're much more than some famous girls who give their name.
It has been in Paris in the promotion of the signing Mango in his new seat, in addition to the presentation of the most important model premies than the Spanish house sponsorized.
Calm and timide, win in short distances.
Tell us you're doing in Paris.
I came to present my sister Penelope and I for Mango in this new summer winter, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango in this fourth time working for Spanish house?
My sister as well as me love the film of the 50s and 60s; from there we get many references.
Then I like to lose me for a city and observe women as they are clothes, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do it very much.
Bailarin, actor and designer, you're a very polyfactic woman, right?
I think yes, but at the end, everything is one and there are many common lazos.
I liked my clothes from little; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to hurry in the armies of my daughter and to see his clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better to go to the attraction park.
Then, with dance, I always tried to care how I was clothing.
You know that dancings are very liked to make us our styles for classs and tests, to look at the shore and feel good.
And in the role of the actriz when you give the clothes to you, it's when you really find the person.
Then, everything will be united, that's it, with very respect for designers and professionality.
You haven't done a lot about 30, have you got a crisis?
He's dead.
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
Find that the woman is done, she has experience and shiny life with less errors.
For me, the biological watch doesn't scare me.
I did the things I wanted from little, and this has given me a lot of internal happiness.
So you think it's mother or not?
From then, I know I'm going to be a mother because I ask the body and, moreover, I want to be a young mother; that's not I want to lose it.
As regards the candidate, I'm not worried about it.
What I'll do is to give him a lot of happiness to my son and to educe it with a lot of love.
As regards the cinema, you're depending on several stars that you're rounded last year.
So, and I'm already grateful to see the light.
I, that I'm a woman who comes from the theatre, I'm very intimidate and worried, all I want for already and clearly, can't be.
I've won't look out the last hour and 'Search for Christ'.
Looking like they look...
A few days ago, you got a passenger with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not me to a passale to make a model.
Just calling me Naomi Campbell, whom I had known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a well-known disfile for his organization 'Women for a better world' and the cloth that we showed - I took two pieces from our collection to Mango - was sought to restore money to this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that kind of heart of Naomi.
They say so many things about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not certain.
In addition, I remain with that very good part in which she is involved.
She asked me to dismiss for a so nice cause, but if it comes to ask me to do the pino, so too.
For the benefits of women of the third world, what you need to do isn't.
Reciprocal alcohol driving drivers should install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver to have three administrative sanctions by alcoholic sanctions, to install in its vehicle a system that prevents the steel vehicle to start, or if it is not soon.
The initiative was already announced in June last month and now appears in the annual memory of the State's State Office, which is a pilot project that will have a period of one year.
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver, so it will also receive a fresh reducing course.
In the experience, as well as the Vial Segurida Inspector General, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the cars complained more than once by driving vessels returns to the car.
Alcolock would prevent it because it is a system connected to the vehicle which measures the alcohol rate in an espirated air and prevents the car starting if the driving driver is not sweet; or when a alcohol concentration is higher than the permitted.
The costs of EUR 1.000 are higher and would be corrected by the sanitation.
In this regard, a study carried out in the EU in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduced up to 65 per cent of the offences during the first installation year.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
The measure is covered to administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing these behaviors before they in criminal crimes.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done in a ordinary way, and, however, the reform necessary for criminal way requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is still not available on the Spanish market in no commercial modality, although it has already been installed experimentally in certain industrial vehicles and public service vehicles.
Only tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote to a PSO's initiative in which it proposes to install this system in school bus as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 17.40 p.m., the time in the programme was at the Presidential Hagar of the Benito Juárez de Mexico DF aircraft in which the Spanish Air Force travelled the Princess of Asturias.
The sun was out, but his rays were still forced to use the hand in a visa way to see the real couple down from the flight.
At the footstep of the scale, the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities.
Hours had previously asked for the street, the taxist, if I knew that the Spanish princes visited the city to formalize a official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you can't go to the airport to load at that time...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But Mexico's press knows who are the Princes of Asturias and the importance of the travel.
Many are expecting in the hamgar of the red helmet and a military ship formed by 27 marine soldiers that interpret the salvation of honors.
The Prince appears to be sounding, clothes of sea blue, and she, Princess, meleans to the wind, very sweet, does not use its usual 'peep-to's', maybe they had reported to him that in the DF threatened to torment.
Regular a sound and an eye stop to photographs before passing to the room where the official committee is expected.
At the gate of the hotel where they stay, one of the four large cities, waits for you for a mexican television newspaper.
The best-building premium of mode
Probably there is no place in the world the most appropriate to present a modest prize, which Paris and perhaps not have a living designer more exquisite and good living than Valentino.
I have only presented the second edition of El Boton-Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international projection of the new talents of the mode.
It is equipped with a cost of EUR 300,000.
Last night Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs in Mango's fleet at the 54th housesmann boulevard of Paris and almost crying about the emotion.
Indeed, it is the second largest shop from the signing in Europe and has been inaugurated by 1.335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
Many events, joined with the desire to thank you to the Developer Valentino who presided the jury of the jury of the jury, made that we ended in a dinner of luxury in the operator Garnier of Paris.
With the nearest Chagals, the Presidential Gala table prepared by Mango, he was still more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart slaughtered and triumphed heart, by the recent failure of his brother, was put a clothes of the House and one of the right sides of ELAH, which cut the breathing, and from his son Luis’ arm, a canon of nearly two meters of length - accompanied to Valentino in the presidency of his home dinner.
Andik, ladies and gentleman of Mango, did the honors and it's so sweet that he ended, near the Rotchil bar without everybody, because both were given them to two ladies.
Monique Cruz, who attended the shop with snakes and shops - and for the dinner, transformed with a long black sexy clothes, was excited when in the night walk by the opera, together with Goya Toledo, taught us the ballet test room and she, remembering other times, took up to one of the bars and made an 'grander sweet' sweet.
Ines Sastre did not remain in the passing by the dependances of the palace, but first he taught us in the mobile phones of his son.
On the next morning we could enjoy the view of Olivier Martínez’s presence - another channel that moves on the moto - and by John Travolta, who came to the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with its sabans, its toilets, and had requested before, that there were no looks in his room.
Stars under the star sky of Paris.
Oh there, it's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There is no 1000 to 1000 more a way to forget the cootic and frenetic life daily.
And if it was little, all are gathered in a book that will bring the relax to the book books on September 30th.
The depertoire is almost punished when it sounds every morning at 7 o'clock, but it is even worse to imagine in the shocked rhythm that implies the current life.
The office is called tension and the computer's sword pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21th century.
But there is no one or two methods to fight daily extension and problems of disconnection with the work world.
No, the number is up to, nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Under the Yoga positions, the classic massage or 'spa' treatment, Susannah Marriott meets on the pages of a book all a 'menu' of opportunities adapted to the enjoyment and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways of relaxing' and its calm will come to the books of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in fields such as work or through personal relations, this 'manual' is unlike such faith.
It also provides other procedures to be in contact with nature or receipt 100% natural that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline does not run for your ventures to restore the body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the sofa, disconnect the mind and focus on reading.
Sleeping talks
Some kids talk for the night.
I'm not referring to those who are very calmed by telling us something happened in the previous day, but to children who speak to be sleeping.
The first time that happens to the best, you bring them a slow, but it is not really important.
It's a good change in the dream that is called sleep.
It's quite frequent, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of you have told you that she spoke for the night.
This phenomenon can appear in a very sporáctic way (one time in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodicly (all day, once a week, once in monthS...), on the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause to determine its appearance.
It is often related to other dream changes, such as the pains, night treasure, night enuresis (slaughter) or soundbulism, but it doesn't have to be so.
As we have previously mentioned, they can also be associated with high feed tables, stress situations or overwhelming situations.
In all ways, it is a little studyed phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be speaking in a calm voice tone, swimming words, a smuggle or all the other (graps, llantes, long speechs...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, it would be convenient to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to verify whether there is a question that generates a lot of concern and gives it out in this way.
We have said it is a good change, therefore it does not have treatment, except that it is associated with another dream change that can be treated (e.g., if it is associated with a dream appnea or a stress table).
What can be done is taking into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to smell the kid before I'm going to sleep.
So search for quiet games and avoid television programs or series that are fearless or little violent.
With very nervous children and costs to relax them, relaxing techniques can be used to help them get a certain internal calm.
This will like the child to have a more quiet dream.
Once the dreams appear to try to keep calm.
I recognize that they are inoffensive for the child and that the next day will not remember anything about what happened.
Useful Councils
Don't let him go.
It is inutile, because he is not conscious, and you will break his dream.
Although you're talking, he's sleeping and so he's relaxing.
I recognize that if you are shown very anxious during several episodes, you would agree to consult or find out what is what generates such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what you say (who isn't the most ordinary one), do not spend in the attempt to make a questionnaire to smile information.
You won't get nothing, because when you're sleeping is not aware of how to organize your thinking.
In addition, you will hear what you say, but you do not know what you are dreaming to say so, with which very carefully about how you interpret the information and the conclusions you know.
You never give him the child that you could ask for the night to know his secrets.
Don't even smell.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In summary, don't worry about them, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
They're finished!
The fútbol club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way of the victory in his field after a long time of missing.
Without a good game, the team created many times of gol and was able to make a gol to win the game.
The ritm was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficult to express themselves.
After a first trial of the captain Kauffmann who shooted the squad with a shoot of fars, Illhaeusern cuasi would take the "poder" and on the Funterfick round, then with Hirn above, Romein with the foot point or Debold came to prevent the defense of marinemarie.
On the other hand, we didn't stop passing the central campsite and just left Riahi in a attack position.
The second time was crucial, first with two occasions of Riahi and Timerale for shamemary, and immediately after the opening of the Marker for Ilhousians with the Marais Gol, well situated to collect the ballon rejected in a first trial of Debold (53 ').
But Illousiens cannot know a long time their happiness and will be obliged to return back to store a twenty-minute later and leave their team partners in numerical minority.
But there will be no problem for the 11 illusionians who returned a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of game during which, after a significant fatful snake, the ball passed very close to the cross-border field.
Sarkozy finds funny fishermen
Before going to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a round by Britain.
In view of the resistance manifestation of fishermen who had strongly affected the last Monday the entries of several bretton and standard ports, the President of the Republic decided to go on March last morning at the port of Gilvinec in Finnisher to find there his representatives.
They promised to join it " with a constructive spirit " and expected that " come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit corresponds to the general " crisis committee " created by bretton fishermen to achieve measures against the increased gas prices, which marks a record to reach EUR 1.14 per litro.
According to Eliseo David Martinon's portfolio, the Chairman will " discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help its companies to be competitive and to save the conditions of marine jobs and repayment " .
Fishermen expect Nicolas Sarkozy to firmly feet.
On Monday morning, they carried out operations to friendship the traffic in Morbian and Calvados, which were so higher than 10 km.
Quiberon's sport port has also been blocked, but the connections to Belle Island have not been stopped.
"A filtering bar" has been placed in the Quiberon Peninsula.
The mariners have already shown their determination by shooting the alba, neumtic and wood palettes before the Brest's carburant deposits, and Lorient, while manifestations were placed in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement passed to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, such as in the Sable d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the boats remained at the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty boats blocked the movements of trade ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Crossic, in the Loira-Atlantic region, stopped late the blocking of the important Donges total rebuilding.
Bologne-sur-Mer fishermen decided to wait until the meeting of this Monday will take place to think about any action.
In Guilvinec, the " Crisis Committee " must think about the march in the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting provided for in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some braton fishermen do not want to be represented by the members of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
" The wheel will continue " because " fishermen did not leave " and " they did not want to move to Paris " , for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas oil rates, are currently paying about 50 cents per litro, but believe that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached only with a gas oil with a price below EUR 0.30 per litro.
The magnificent Paul Newman

Analysis of the historical session of the Paris Bolsa
The Bolsa of New York accused a historical fall last Monday after the Chamber of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98% or has never been seen in Bolsa about 800 points, and Nasdaq was 9.14%.
The industrial index Dow Jones fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.

With 228 votes against and 205 votes, representatives refused to the secretariat of the United States Deputy, Henry Paulson, the means that I requested.
About two Republicans of each three rejected their plan.
"This is not a good sign sent to the market, which sees the Congress impossible to adopt a plan, " said Lindsey Piegza, the Financial FTN.
"This shows how the market was counting with this plan ", added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days is "the late."
" If the project is really deadly (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the relevance (American Central Bank, N.B.) to administer the crisis, which would cover more credit conditions", reported Brian Bethune, head of the Global Insight Economic and Finance.
And more focusing on the feeling of emergency, " every day that happens is announced the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, Mrs. Piegza underlined.
After the Washington Mutual chief last Wednesday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by their rival Citi Group.
In Europe, the crisis slowly accelerated, which caused emergency interventions in the benefit of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets face " not only a crisis in the United States but to a global crisis ", added the financial analyst of the FTN.

Obama, winner during the first television bathroom
At the first debate of the Thursday between both candidates in the White House, there was another one to know who triumphated between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Without surprise, the general quarters of Republican and Democratic campaigns declared their own victory in this television duty that has been followed by a third of the American families.
The political analist David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, although honorable, was not "blunt" to allow her to spend down in the trials for five weeks of the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose survey of the public view published last Saturday, gives five advantages for Obama (49 per cent against 44 per cent for McCain), considers that it is the democracy who had been good.
Among the indecisive electors, which are those who are accounting, Obama grew over to 39% of the surveys, while 25% of them granted the victory to McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama could confirm his benefit on Thursday with the expected benefit of his member of his own candidate, José Biden, during the first and the only public debate with its rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to subsidy it.
He has good instincts ", even though Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventh-general McCain proved that his insufficient experience in the field of external policy, underlined the "intelligence" of his adversary on these issues that were in the heart of this first care.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand... " several times accused.
" I don't think that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be the President, " has also assured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in the Republican television advertisements.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without disconsciousness, it was shown concise and necessary.
He highlighted its ability to take good decisions and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done it ", replied, this weekend, a democratic television advertising that reproved him to the Republic because he did not consider the importance of the impact of the crisis on the United States " .
"In the twenty-five minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama declared yesterday, before 20,000 people had been gathered for a election meeting in North Carolina under a rain.
He did not say the words "media" or "workers". "The financial derogation clearly favours Obama, which is considered by the United States as the most capable person to save the economy that is on the borde of the precipitation.
"The next week could be a decisive episode ", estimated, yesterday, the influenced and democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared the " good economic instincts" of Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final consequence of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that, despite the reduction of taxes of 95 per cent of the United States in the Wall Street overseas, the Senator of Illinois also pointed out that the achievement of a possible energy independence from the country was its first priority, with the creation of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear centrals from here to 2030.
Actually, both candidates had assessed the issues relating to the financial saving plan of $7,7 billion (4,70 million) adopted last night by the Congress and extremely unpopular.
"In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Youths and opposites showed the last Sunday in the main place of the Belarus capital to reject the results of the legislatives in advance.
Some hundreds of Belarus meetings were held on Sunday after the end of the election centres in the Minnesota central place to protest against the fraudulent nature of legislatives.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate the power of President Alexandre Lokkachenko: "The dictator, he has to dimit ".
Some recognized that they have not voted, "for what, because they will do what they want with my vote, " says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that I had made good to foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is ready to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visa for 40 Belarus leaders and the congelation of certain assets, may be highlighted if these elections are considered cleans for observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
"We have been placed to the electoral committees and our observers could not participate in the counting of the votes," said Youri Potemkine, the porter of the Union of Democratic Forces, a hisogeneous reruption of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change, stressed by Alexandre Milinkievitch, the former candidate of the opposition to the presidential election of 2006 and the leader of the movement for Europe, because the important one is who accounts for the votes, and in our home is the executive power.
If some of the opposition Members enter into the Parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
"But their entry to Parliament may mean TV appearances, meetings in regions and law proposals. "
The opposition should therefore be in the political game because " must start dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, is in a crisis, and if we don't reform, we are risking to make Russia's protector.
But we want to be independent. "
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, following the election process, does not recognize the validity of the vote.
It stressed that the participation figures seem to be too high, and that the generalization of the vote with advanced (26 % of the electors in Minsk) promoted manipulations.
"Have you noticed the elections? Ask the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the election centres.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition to the Parliament, which will be better to the power. "
The silence of the night returns again in the place of October.
In the television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Committee are welcomed for their success.
The interview - Sangre returns to be safe
Hema-Québec celebrated his tenth anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his President, Francine Decary, had a reason to rejoice, because Hema-Québec returned to be one of the most safe and effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he recognised the public's confidence that had been seriously discovered by the polluted blood scandale in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service have been contaminated by human immunedeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and public discount, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey, chaired by the judge Horacio Krever, which intended to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and to make recommendations so that such disaster would not be reproduced.
While the judge Krever late in presenting his relationship, some provinces then created a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau Committee complied with this mission.
As a result of the Gelineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and both territorys.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec started its activities, almost 38 per cent of the people had yet confidence in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Decary.
The situation was degrading.
After having made many efforts to improve the security of blood products and much work during the years they had continued, we have recovered the public's confidence ", said pridely that at the beginning of 2008, about 94 per cent of the Chebeca population had the following confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Decary, however, remembers that " confidence is something extremely fragile " .
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec applied the precaution principle.
At that time, we were attended in Europe at the birth of many cases of the human variant of the local vacuum disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, account of Decary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we support in one of the main recommendations of the Crever and Gelineau reports, which, when we do not know and when serious disease can enhance it, in this case the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that brings death inevitablely, sets out out of exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we rejected the blood of people who had remained more than one month in the UK since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown out of any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us so that the principle of precaution that was applied had a meaning. "
In 1999 there was a more sensitive technique of HIV detection in the market: the nucleus acid tests that allow to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not the antibodies against the virus, where the tests were based until now.
Nuclear acid tests allowed to accumulate the period between the time the person has been infected and the moment when the first virus can be detected in the blood for our techniques, the specialist explains.
We could reduce this period in a less than one week.
We decrease so substantially the risk that some donors are infected without knowing it and cannot detect them.
These improvements allowed significantly to reduce the risk of combating AIDS by blood transfusion.
Today, a person every 12 million runs the risk of receiving HIV contaminated.
"This means that you will have to distribute 12 million blood products before someone is infected by HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes each year between 4000,000 and 500 000 blood products, it will pass over 24 years prior to an HIV transmission case for a blood product.
I think that today can be received or prescribed a blood transfusion to recover health without concern", states Hema-Québec's head.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products security.
You never know what pathogens could emerge in the system.
Last year on the island of the Reunion, the Chikungunya Virus, for example, is transmitted by an insect in blood.
"The need to be constantly monitored ", follow Dr. Decary before emphasising that, in addition to a safe supply, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
" The needs are increased because the population is old.
Since more aggressive cancer treatments, patients often need a injection of red glucose or plates.
Population age has also results on the network of blood donors that regroup only by average term 3 per cent of Quebequees admissible to blood donation. "
All persons with good health, 18 years of age and who meet the admissibility criteria may, however, give blood every 56 days, or 6 times per year.
In the meantime, 14 per cent of the people proposing their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or Malaria, for example, and if they traveled to a country where Malaria is reign, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3 per cent, we managed to maintain an inventary that covers the needs of hospitals.
Penuria is very rare.
But members of this donor network must be renewed as they old and can't give their blood anymore.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since the current life is very disappointed, we rarly find the time to pass an hour to give her blood ", Francine Decary is afflicted.
With a annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including oxy, heart valves, eye globals and skins that are almost exclusively used for the large skins.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before they are stored in Hema-Québec, which also managed the only public blood bank in the Umbilical Round in Quebec.
The humble coron that was formerly considered as biomedic waste is filled with a rich blood of mother cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leucemia.
"We have celebrated a few weeks ago, the place in the bank of our millennium shows the blood of the humble coron and is expected to get out of more than thousands of them per year.
We have to begin to propose it for insights at the beginning of the next year, ", Dr. Decary needs to describe this curon blood plan as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed of not enjoying this " because Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and cost-building programme in all Quebec hospitals.
Softbol - The impact on semi-final
Montreal Impact was qualified for the semi-final of the eliminatory series of the USL first division, thanks to a victory of 3-1 (4-3 in summary) at the coast of the Seattle Sounders, last night, during the second and decisive partition of the final room series in the Saputo Stadium.
The center camper Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive gol at the 90th minutes of the game.
After the first time without gol anywhere, the central campsman David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many occasions of gol.
Roger Levesque was the only one that disappointed Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first party of the ida and turning series of games, the Impact had suffered by 2-1 in Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in semi-final.
Thunder lost 3-1 in the back game on Saturday afternoon in the Minnesota, but the Whitecaps accompanied the semifinals by 5-4.
The Impact should be addressed to Whitecaps on Wednesday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Soon – The goal of Kovalev's victory
The three number one of the Canadians is ready to operate the time.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn has animated the attack in a winning by 3-2 from Canadians to the free barriers against the Florida Panthers last night in the Central Bell.
Costitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a gol, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev took a step in this winning, the Tricolor room in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory marking the only gol.
"I'm still not ready, before the Russians.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play the maximum in the first time, announced Guido Carbonneau.
But I think it applies the end of the party.
There was a beautiful ovation. "
Check is occupied from North
The First Minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general Council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Boldu (left), tried to be elected during the partial election of today.
Refusing the limits of our last large northern border ": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest had presented with visibility, remaining in the large lines, in the end of the General Council of the Quebec Liberal Party, Lévis yesterday.
After him, during his speech, images were designed.
They disfilated, in three major screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric embars, mining exploitation, from Quebec viewed by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means, such as during the election period.
The first minister believes that elections will take place this autumn, although he saw that his time was very full.
The " North Plan" is the fourth side of a "vision" which the first Minister intends to have for Quebec, the of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on the hand of work with France, a partnership between Canada and Europe and harmonity with Ontario.
In recent discussions of the first minister, the opening of the North – the northern territory to the 49th paralel – had never been subject to a presentation.
However, the first minister was limited to explain why the North was " a joy to the great potential " , but did not give a term, investment amounts or priority in future projects.
What could be particularly developed is: hydroelectricity, forest, but in particular the mine sector, which is covered by the growth of emergency countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " niquel, cinc, copper, platino, gold, plata, iron, titanium and also diamant ", according to the list of Mr. Charest.
This " territory two times large as France ", " is our home, is in Quebec.
It is not only our home, but it is in us,” he insisted, as to show that I requested a national founder.
Quebec was built very thanks to his relationship with the North, underlined: the ride to gold in Abitibi, the Quebec Engineering, the Bahia James.
"It belongs to us, it's our future," he added, after having made a theatrical suspense to contemplate the pretty map behind him.
North, 70 per cent of the Chebecue Territories, is a part of the Labrator who always re-evited, required the first minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated.
There is a border line in which it is not agreed for a long time and, when the time is presented, I reiterate that position by the Government. "
Furthermore, " with climate changes, we need to remedy our Northern vision ", he declared about the Northwest Pass, which will be open every year because of the funding of the ices.
In this new geopolitical context, the first minister considers that the territory is a duty.
And the people of the territory, the First United Nations and the Inuits?
The first minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful to them and that the project would benefit them, especially for youth.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Peter Corbeil and Michel Léturneau (ancient deputy of the Czech party in Hungary), already began consultations near a tremendous communities.
An interminist committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Sports and Natural Resources) has an important role.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a significant meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting at which " a common vision will be given " .
Northern Development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, ordered and respected for the environment " , promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is continuously with the first liberal ministers before him.
" As the previous liberalians, we thought another way to transform challenges in new times of growth and development. "
This was one of the recurrent themes at the end of the week, which started the Wednesday with a great cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of John Leage's arrival to the party's power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rebuild the Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adelard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Leage that made the peaceful Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Boursa who made the Bahia James our party knows to make the future ", says Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invited another reference, the conservator, the John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, the first minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the subject of Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric emballage project, Mr. Charest stressed that his service was planned for 2012.
"This remains among us, but I expect to be there," he trusted his warriors, urging applauses.
Indeed, the first minister, who said in April that there would not be elections in 2008 and without doubt in 2009, did not delay the possibility of starting this vote, as the law allows it.
It stressed that his time is not yet full, especially because of a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council for the end of the week, delivered to the Liberal Chief a platform containing nationalist resolutions, in particular " constitutional aspirations " which had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec claims, in particular, the recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished to name Quebec members of the Council of the Radiodistribution and Canadian Telecommunications and have a veto right to make decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcome the great lines of the North Plan with scepticism.
The chief of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, emphasized the North Quebec Development Policy that the Landry Government was launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal Government, reaching the power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If it had done, "we made progress today" commented Mrs. Marois next to his candidate in Jean-Talon (the vote that has been done today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec was able to support the adoption of a Northern Government plan.
"But what you want is that this is not just a spectrum," commented leader Sebastien Proulx, in replacement of Mario Dumont, who returns to holidays today.
Letters - A unhonorable country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) in the Harper office, which allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "vergottenance" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who brought an instant struggle for justice, and that he worth all our admiration, which says everything about the relationships of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only, among all Western countries involved, who has not repatriated their national that is closed in the concentration field of Guantánamo.
It is a government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that his crimes occurred.
The only Government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, rejects its promise and lets live in human conditions a soldier child.
The only one that shoots with false justice to assess the guilty of the accused.
We recall that UNICEF, International Administration and the Association of Canadian lawyers, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to enjoy the benefit of a fair process in Canada.
It is this government who closes the eyes of torture: it is unlikely that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, without doubt forever after many years of explanation.
We still do not realize that, but we now have a huge erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", which is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that does not mean.
It has already arrived the time where no more morality is: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprisoned to a Canadian citizen as he wants the government head until now of minority (what will happen after October 14?).
Many electors believe that they will find salvation in a party that pleads the Virtud, the Law and the Order: I don't see that this government has rejected what the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews' ridicule is caused by this renewal and for nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In its edition of 17 September, Le Dever published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president and director of the Canadian Mine Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logical, Barrick Gold states that the largest aury company in the world tried to spend a process of six million euros against three authors and a small editorial house to cause a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that judges are independent and imparcial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution by defamation, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would harm anyone to support an opposite position to your own?
The result of the plot has little importance, authors and editors of the Noir Canada book should pay considerable amounts to prepare their defence and fighting, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the balls almost without the mine.
The tactics, in these unigual struggles, often consists of ruining the demanders in order to put up a friendly arrangement that will love the opposition in addition to resident whoever is going to re-examinate the issue.
If Barrick Gold really loved a public debate, it was in front of the public view that would have had to present its vision of facts.
On the contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates in Canada are normally made by change of ideas and not by shocks.
It was because the minera opened its books, its employees and established a real debate, through journals, media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that would have been able to clarify the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust in the public opinion and rejects the requests and substantial letters for the authors of Noir Canada.
Maybe Mr. Garver could explain how to ask a "publical" debate by depreciation of this opinion?
According to the vice-President, this word seems only to be appointed to the lawyers very paid and not to all Canadians; this represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, delegators also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and the editors of Noir Canada do it all because he rejects the brutal way of the mine.
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and judge it, but as a basis for civilized changes in arguments, and not in the context of what many people understand as a death persecution (forwards the " public debate ", Barrick Gold has just set out a request for the authors of Noir Canada intimidating them to use this word).
In addition to the surreal speech by Mr. Garver, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack against university's freedom of search and truth, essential for all democratic societys.
Denied the right to quote credible sources and to discuss the facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss the subjects that disappoint the rich enterprises of this world in a country such as Canada, in spite of many persecutions, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wants a public and transparent debate, it could follow the scientific standards used by the Noir Canada authors.
He has a right to answer.
The university world, which we belong, knows for a long time to manage the debates and disagreements and to solve conflicts.
The unforeseen persecution of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, in contrast with what you want, you do not want to do a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put devices that limit such abuse persecutions.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans are agreed
Bush and the leaders of the Congress, once republic and democratic, finally reached an agreement on the most important economic saving plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan of $7,7 million, which intends to spend the financial crisis that takes to Wall Street for months has still been confirmed by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it provides for a better control by the electors of their implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the invested public money, the new provisions to contain the number of lack of payment houses, as well as a right to control payments paid to leaders of supported enterprises.
The American Secretariat of the Tesor, Henry Paulson, President of the Representative Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Representative at the negotiations table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after the midday night, at the end of a negotiation martyr that had been held two days.
" We make great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the markets, " stated the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"All has been done to cover the economy and the USs before the current crisis in Wall Street, " explained the Democracy.
"It's the fundamental point: if we do not do this, traumaism, caos and distress on the daily life of the United States will be great", states the Republic of Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had been very rapidly concluded in the last hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new failure in the humor of investors.
The last time they had been fixed was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, which have been late in the negotiations, were more favourable for the agreement, without forgetting expressing their impetus to be obliged to reach this extremeness.
Senator Barack Obama was granted some provisions to achieve the agreement, especially the owners would allow to maintain their home and the wage of the leaders of the State surviving enterprises.
"When the contributionrs are requested to take extraordinary measures due to the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to be happy.
But these measures are necessary ", commented on the American television.
His Republican adversary, John McCain, was interviewed in another chain to know if he would vote by the proposed plan, answered: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote. "
"The important points I read [monster] that is something that we will have to divide and with which we can go forward.
He said that the option to not do anything is not acceptable " .
The plan of 700 billion intends to purchase with the money of the contributors the duty debts, the risk assets and inconvenible from the American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by a immobiliary bubble that first led to the shock of hypotecary risk credits before being extended to other common forms of credit titles (PCA) and to cause liquidity congelation and department from banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of Republican elections that had made changed the first agreement project last week.
We believe we have been out of the shock since the democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only assured by the government, better than purchased.
In order to strike up the stands for the whole world in the Congress, we also added a provision that if the government had to take loss for five years with this programme, it could imply new rates that would like to help him to restore money.
The new plan prescribes the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which 100 million more can be added if the President seems to be necessary.
The payment of the other 350 million would be confirmed by another vote by the Congress.
Instead of their aid, Washington will get participations in supported enterprises that will be divided to you in case of wine and which can be sell again when the torture is passed.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to delay the embargo procedures in relation to housing with immobiliary loans under this plan, as well as to establish limits on reimbursement and metall compensations paid to the leaders of the crisis.
The architectes of the plan would like to see it subject to the vote of the Chamber of Representatives since today and to the Senate on Thursday.
Despite all its efforts, it is still not sure that your plan will be adopted.
Some people continued to protest against this project, both from the Republicans and the Democratics.
The Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Committee of Finance of the Camera, declared his electors that " with any evidence Washington did not understand " .
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But it is not the use of contributions. "
The Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in the Congress, presents otherwise the problems, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Fourty teachers of economicity, including three Nobel Prizes, were written to say to us: We asked the Congress not to press and carefully examine the way to take ", said the Congress last night.
At the same time, in Europe, we had again the test of the world's naturality of crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the parcial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11,2 million euros (16,3 million dollars).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French BNP Paris bank was denied to purchase its competitor in slaughter since $2,9 million had lost (2,9 million) during the crisis of immobilial risk loans in the United States.
Fortis is employed by 85 000 people and is part of the twenty larger European banks and the 10 larger insurers.
"This is not lost money, he declared the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Boss yesterday.
Instead, we have the right to vote in the bank and influence.
It's just something that the warrants and the families appreciate now that the times are uncertain. "
During that time, on the other side of the Mancha, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that suffers the financial crisis.
According to the English Press, the government would be charged for all income in the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 million euros (75.5 million dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander told to know yesterday that it was the one who would buy the bank's banks and bank accounts.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented their triumph for so long.
The American actor with a lovely dream had been released from his narcist side?
Yeah, and no.
His power, his sensitivity and a talent that was clearly also will have been left from the record of power that have the true sacred monsters.
But that's a great underground runner!
Paul Newman died on Wednesday 83 years, because of a pulmonary cancer in his Connecticut cut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of the fast years.
It is less phenomenon than Brando, who seemed much and was considered for a long time as a rival in the cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also the apostle of the freedom and stall of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood makes many magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from the German Jewish father and the mother of Hungary origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without ego, the last quality mark.
Because in him, a whole country was designed to be a loving country of self-doing man, the fighter of the Pacific war, blessed in battle, which, at the beginning of the 50s, studied the dramatic art in Yale, then frequently the Actor's Studio of New York before triumphing in the theater, in the television and early in the film.
This man who struggled by civil rights was also the car driver who was classified in the second position at Le Mans 24 hours in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a couple of modelled since 1958 with the actor Joanne Woodward.
They also disappear with him the secret sides of this secret, discreet and compromised star, allergic to the scandales of the spectacle that we don't know very well.
It's a honored man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death tried to the cinefils this weekend, while their large roles were covered in the black screen of memorys.
More than a mid - century of the seventh American art in perpetual change defies through it.
Many remembrances come back in the memory like the cow-boy with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensible wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the adjusted zinc table of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More closer to us (1990), we call to his sensible Mr. Bridge, distressed by a marriage that did not comply with all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have passed to the film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminally tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up there Likes Me, Robert Wise, is a role to James Dean, which actually launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic eating in the solar film The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar to the best film in 1973.
Awesome biller player in the magnificent film The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), will repeat the personality in The Color of Monney de Martin Scorsese, who valued him in 1987 his only Oscar between nine names.
This face that changed with the years, he was him.
He's got it.
The times change during their career.
Young people know it mostly thanks to the Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977) in Reggie Dunlop, trainer of a hockey team on ice little ortodox.
His fans returned to see him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With the last role of the Irish mafia mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the rise was rich.
On the contrary to several Chinese legends quite shortly left the cart, Newman remained much in the world of the cinema, claiming Hollywood, gold, speed and conceptions.
The French cinema Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge that lives in " the underlying " and which judges his too supported benefits.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman when the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
However, less often interpreted the role of young galan than marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, cabins or unexpected, whose races reflected the rebellion.
As performer, Newman revealed sides of his real public sensitivity not very well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (as the news of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, described a woman's melancoly box.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdosis gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, the work of pump and tristeness.
"Every of the numerous homes that were discovered last night for Newman, his great friend and former arms partner Robert Redford (we had worked together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
Generosity, love of existence are important races of the falling actor.
On the other side of his legend's career, there is also a great warrior for civil rights, ecology, independent China, a contestant against Hollywood's excess.
We have seen your face to reigne on the wine salt bottles, the salts, the gallets and other foods, judgeing this method as a bad method, although it started as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to their Child Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, better than be satisfied of your mito, it will be compromised until the end.
He left them to his five daughters a letter containing these words: "Every and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the care of a American artist so luxury and generous.
A model citizen.
What were they produced in the Succio & amp; Co.?
Soon, on 8 October, the criminal process will be initiated against Yanos Zuschlag and its compliments.
Political and its commitments to commit significant damage frauds in a business way, continuously and organized way in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Fiscalia, the funds obtained in public competitions were used in their own purposes, justifying in many cases the compliance of tasks with false facture.
The public funds and the funds - in its totality about 65 million HUF - have been part of the stores of the Fiatal Organisation and in part in the board of individuals.
The method, which was given to know by researchers also, was to justify the cover of the funds obtained in public competitions with false facture behind which they had not implemented really, the different associations had never complied with their assigned obligations.
According to the accused, most factures were false.
For that reason, householders were obtained in the market of the division of Józsefvas, and circular seals were made in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that, on behalf of which company the false facture had to be carried out, was decided among others in that round by the Supreme Baltic region, Yanos Zuschlag sent to Istvan Lados.
This last condemned that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He requested facture for its consumption, and they were modelled to make the factures that were presented among others in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Deportive Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor and Capital Appeal.
These factures were signed in most of them by Istvan Lados and their compliance András śri, who, according to our information, had better written the reports required to obtain public grants.
During one of his "study wheels" Lados elected a brain.
According to two factures sent by Zuschlag and its compliments in 2003, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the center manager, many people do not fall at the same time.
Similarly, the facture issued in the summer 2002 for the Jobb Jövæért Foundation - later called Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert - was filled with formal and contextual errors.
As a hostel of Badacsonytomina was just three rooms and more than ten people couldn't stay there in one night, but in the facture, there were hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of great fantasy also exaggerated when they pointed to the Gastronomic Center Pigal Kft. Because in the holding of books of the same – according to the information provided to the Fiscalia - had no document named Jobb Jövæért and Hopaá.
Gyśz Farkas, the company manager, informed you hvg.hu when it was quoted by the fiscality and showed the factures, so I knew it was false documents.
"In the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in a wrong place."
He acknowledged: In addition to the formal problems, I did not agree that, according to the facture, hundreds of people were accommodated, because they only had just once rooms in which there were not many people.
Furthermore, the facture also included food, while the restaurant hasn't worked.
Factory manufacturers were not informed that the travel agency elected in Budapest organized exclusively travels to the outside, so that in the effective payment factuals noted as a service of a travel within Hungary, which was not matching the practice of spending facture of the Agency.
Furthermore, as was known during the investigation, the VAT also included in the document, although travellers outside the territory of the European Union were exempted from taxes.
Among other things, the IVA was also incorrect in the four documents sent by the Hotel Revfullöp Kft. for the foundation of Jobb Jövæért, since the company services are not loaded with 25, but only 15 percent of VAT, and the hotel employees only extended factures that were made to machine but the facture was manual.
In addition, the "expeditors" also made other errors, such as in the case of a company in which they put into the facture as the activity carried out by road transport that was known during the fiscal investigations - not performed the company founded as investor consultor.
Similarly by formal differences - inadequate format of the facture, it is known that false factures are sent to Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Bytes Pont.
Like in Ravenna Bt. or the Sport Camping of Kunfeherito, whose representatives refused to have sent these factures.
The falsificators noted that when the Fiatal Városért Egysület group was there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyrigajhaza was in the liquidation process, so the responsibility of the liquidation process - according to our information - had refused to send this document.
The factures were consciously dismissed
Another group of false facture manufacturers is composed of those who were aware that they should send physical factures.
The Fundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvay, on request of Ballodal Fiatal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued a facture for about four million HUF named the Egyuttt Foundation to Harmadik Evezredért.
Collab Kft's manager. - According to the accused - one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, was convinced to issue physical facture.
Similarly, the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, provided factures for a closed value of five million HUF to the foundation of Jobb Jövṣṭért Alapítvány, the Atlasz Egyesület Association and the Vörôsfenyś Egyesület Association , without real economic activity behind.
There was no capital movement, since they then cancelled the factures prepared, but forgot to make the documentation into this entity.
The following group of false facture manufacturers include those who have any link to the accused.
For example, Iván Kubatov was the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trio SL with fixed seat in Budapest, which was employed with the trade of fuel and vehicles.
This company issued numerous factures for a closed value of 18 million HUF in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the research data, these factures were purchased by the Kiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft., which is under liquidation process since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Roman who Iván Kubatov should have issued also the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that sent on behalf of the facture company for Atlasz, Hopaah and Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvny covering its own amount.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were found by Roman albanians on express request by Iván Kubatov.
Nevertheless, any of the companies actually worked because of the accused that they did not receive work.
But it was profitable from these companies, since at the request of his compliance, the lawyer Z Solt Szente, who prepared the registration documents of the company, spent factures on behalf of the companies for the organizations associated with Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and Y-Generation.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade was totally 15 factures to different entities for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The Fiscalia considered that Kubatov received the VAT and 10 per cent of the facture.
This man also used the company in Szi-Beri command to issue physical factures used in the Biztos Pont competition.
Y-Generation and Sövetség to Modern Magyarországert presented a complaint in January 2006 to Tacsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), the Socialist Party's public utility entity.
From the competition, 5000,000 HUF obtained respectively, but did not use the money for the contest objectives.
In order to not find this, they presented five physical factures from the Work Team Kft TMA.
These were the factures found during the record of Arpád Kemecsei at the Headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
part of the accused will probably report in the court - as they did in the Fiscalia - the course of false facture.
The most interesting can be the condemnation of the main accused Yanos Zuschlag, if you decide to dismantle everything.
Since its confesions have not been very detailed, and although he repeatedly promised to speak about everything, this has not been done until now.
The question is: What is interested to do?, for perhaps in change of the majority of money - 50 million HUF - socialists have reached an agreement with him so that Zusi would like all the responsibilities.
On the other hand, for these days, he was even able to oppose, since to eliminate his carcerary conditions requested home arrest, but he was reiterately rejected.
While the numerous authors of extremely higher economic crimes, which have never returned the money, are free or at least can wait at their own home, he has no possibility for it.
Psychology of the oversets: Why do we pay more money?
The participants of the substances are intended to pay more money and excellence the product.
Neurologists and economics at the University of New York found the neurological - economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to the study appeared in Science magazine, people do not want to lose competitives such as eBay substances, so they prefer to pay a excessive price even.
Scientists tried to establish the neuroological scheme of this " game" through experimental substances.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the one participated in a substate, while it was reviewed through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of persons involved in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win the money, but during the substances, where it is an essential element to support more than the other, the game losing was intensified the functioning of the stretched complex under the brain cortex.
This brain area, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the nervous "auto premium" mechanism.
According to scientists, the increase in the plants is explained as a prevention to not cause intense reaction of the road.
In order to fundamentalize its theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial monitoring study.
In this experiment, three groups were opposed to a person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply communicated with the real value of the product concerned, and its integrants posted.
Another group further was promised that, if they win, they would receive $15 more prize.
Instead, the third group received $15 precisely prior to the substance, but in the case of the loss of the substance, the integrators of the group lost even that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one, the triumph and the other the failure was highlighted.
However, by verifying the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group that played “the failure” were ready to support even more than the members of the control group and the “ganner” group.
"This results cannot be deducted from any existing economic theory previously.
Thus, until now, they explained the phenomena of the substances only with the joy of win and risk prevention.
Only the visual neurological methods helped to solve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now arrive to a third explanation" - established Andrew Schotter, professor of the economy power of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
In the world some 50 million people suffer from hepatitis B or C chronic, and in Hungary the chronic illness is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of counted in this country is calculated in hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousands are treated because many of the nurses do not know that they are counted.
Hepatitis name is the common name of different illness diseases caused by virus.
The symptoms appear to be very much; they are characteristics the infection of the hepatitis and the clergy, but their pathogenic agents and occasional diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses dependent on pathogenic agents are propagated through two major forms: hepatitis A and E for food (e.g. with water or contagious food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruss with blood and body humor (esperma, vaccine humor, saliva).
Re travellers are recommended to be protected by vaccine against virus A and B, against C is not vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consumption of infected food, are shown by a general state, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After it appears in the skin and white eyes, the excretion is clear, the dark color skin and the curation can even last two - three weeks.
Any year, a million people die in the world in cancer and hepatic surgery caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that, according to calculations, only one of each ten counted is receiving pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment, hepatitis can produce hepatic cirrose and even cancer.
Most containers do not know that he is sick because this pathoological agent is paulatinely destroying the hepatic cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
It is therefore very important for the premature recognition, the systematic medical control.
This disease is much more frequent in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tatuages.
Today there are some 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can also be discovered with a laboratory routine control, it should be worth consulting the family doctor when experienced some unknown symptom.
The disease has treatment if it is discovered at time, it is possible to exclude the body’s virus, so it can be eliminated and prevented cancer.
On September 30, the World Day of Hepatitis was organized first in 2004 by nursing organizations.
Its aim is to call attention to the causes of the chronic infections of the hepatic evented by virus and to the importance of premature recognition.
Does it less pain to whom believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calm effect that also enabled the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experience: analyzing how religious faith affects human pain - reported the British Telegraph newspaper.
In the context of this unique experience, electric shock applied to 12 Catholic believers and the same amount of athes, while all were looking at a painting of Virginia.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanne technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of investigations in which at the side of the academics also participate scientists, philosophys and theologists of the various departments of the University.
The analysis occurred in the following way; they set a chispenant instrument to the left of the patient, which applied the electric shock.
The investigators requested him to the participants of the experiment to finish their views in two paintings; to Virginia, the work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century and the Dama of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The investigators had the hope that the Virgin Mary spectacle would cause a certain religious spirit among the faithful ones, while they chose the oil of Leonardo because he was not too different from the other, and they thought that he had a calm effect.
Patients spent a half hour in a MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric chocs in four subsequent parts while observing the picture of a religious topic or the other.
The Catholics claimed that when looking to Virginia Maria, they felt "security" as people "protected", "settled and reigned peace in their hearts."
When observing the religious theme table, they felt a 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonard’s work.
The psycholog Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such impacting image you can get a similar effect with the atheis also, there is only the appropriate image.
"We should find a person who feel very positive, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
The English Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases of reality change our personality" - added Wright.
After these magnificent results, one questionnaire was only: What effect would have on the regulation of pain if the Madonna of Leonardo or another paintinger of his skin would be shown to the faithful ones?
Even though the vision of a Virginia of High Quality Maria would still be better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
In its tenth anniversary, Google can state: it can be found in the box of people as well as in the sky above his head; you know where your holidays occurred, to which doctors visit and what is what they interested.
But, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is not yet enough.
On the other hand, the sceptics that make a paralel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently declared the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to gather the most possible personal data about its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goals of Google founders: "We gather in a system all the information in the world!".
According to Google's leader, the company even after ten years of work that returned to the World is still at the initial stage of being able to handle all the information.
To the question what's going on within five years Schmidt answered so: I want Google to answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the best work I would agree?" - but software can not answer such simple questions as there are no sufficient information from users.
Not all internates are aware that during their browsing on the Network are precisely stored the key words searched, IP addresses and pages have been taught when the search ended.
Thanks to Personalized Search that has been debugging two years ago, users can store their own navigation history, they can return to see what they were looking before, which they opened and thanks to this history will generate more personalized search - in this logic will be based on the Recommendations, where the system will offer us products and services on the basis of previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if you use my data against me itself, if you receive information about my activities? - Ask those users who are worried about seeing the Google informative monopolie.
In most cases, the potential represented by the company is what can be fearable and not the adjustment, the fear of punishment, the angel for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that they are not only kept, but also in reasonable cases, all the claimed expressions, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of internal persons.
The most discussed example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedofils when Google gave him to the Brazilian government the information of his web page, called Orcus, to identify the pedofils.
Instead, international persons concerned about human rights, in May, when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the defence of electronic rights, examined the court that had reasoned in the fight with the FBI: according to the sentence, it could not be obliged to Google, by any of the points of the Constitution to provide any kind of information requested in secret by the FBI.
(In the same time, the federal government has achieved its pretext to strengthen the child's protection law for some 50 thousand web addresses and some thousand searched phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the full lists of web pages and key words of the last two months.)
This is quite contradicting the view on Google: they criticize those who fear to provide their personal data because they think that their intimity is harmful, their private life when they start using Google services, and are rebelled against it as against multinational image companies.
While while, the geek-American culture and its enthusiastic followers, internate and users of other countries, come in them in the future generation, "the corporation of vanguardy", not to their rival, Microsoft, catalogued by their Windows as the World Conquistator, so much as both are in the same goal.
This may happen because Google on the other hand of Microsoft, does not request users any identification code, no money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package, constantly updated and seems younger, more collaborator than the official guiding practice of software.
But it may also be because geek is precisely seeing the very problematic relationship between the rights of people and the Internet that is just one of the key words mentioned in the past few years: the Web 2.0.
The website 2.0 is the collaboration, leave the intentional shoes behind us and use the available communication channels, and while the measures of these variables individually are still the same: show us yourself.
A normal young man can have profiles on many collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music costs, then they can include in a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, where the most recent photo galleries that are stored on the Flickr or Picasa.
We can know many cases of those who are discovered, for example, that the girl, when seeing the flow of photos of the next morning of the common friends, it is known with whom passed the previous night his fraudulent boyfriend or can take away the employee of a company because it writes his sincere opinion in his blog on the direction of the company: one thing is safe, the definition of private life has been completely remarked.
The "on line" life of a person is what she shows from himself - this is the definition which is hidden behind the conduct of the youth today.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to escape the Google monopolie, you can do it (e.g. by using the Google search system, but don't leave sheets).
There are many people who do not want to register on collective pages to avoid finding them, but can be replaced by Google's "on line" applications, from text editing software to the image applications and reading of news with alternative versions, which do not connect with gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile on us.
The public opinion almost expects openly the day in which Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 million is more than IBM (140 million), Intel (124 million) or Coca-Cola (110 billion), the advertising surfaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of advertising agencys, while the services that are being introduced are increasingly caused to serious head pains not only to Microsoft, but also to many other software developed companies.
Critical observers, however, will also find the alarming contradictions: for example, the upper direction rejected routinely the protest of employees after duplicating the price of the child guard of the company, considering too much the limited number of employees of food, but it is nothing compared with the fact that in 2006, Google had been sent before the Chinese government and the company, according to the agreement, filtered any information that violates the good moral and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal regulations of the company says that they will not announce any new service with advancement, but only when they were ready to work, what if it is sure is that the predictable problems of the next months and years can return to the World: while some believe that the project of scanning and book files and Google magazines will buy such sizes that the company will soon be quoted by the United States Supreme Court, others fear their health system, because in it we can create our entire health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it can provide a good primary matter for the scientist writers, the Scroogled, a newspaper of Cory Doctorow's popular, describes in the future orweliana, where a man only of the Google data can be described alarmally well.
Two young ones of age helped to remove the legs to the author of the double murderer of the city of Ozd.
The police asked two ages of age about the double murder of Ozd who, according to the reasoned suspicion, helped to remove the legs of the crime - said on March the portion of the General Commissioner of the province of Borsod.
Young people acknowledged the crime that was sentenced to them, and they are currently accused of criminal offenders.
The two minors, according to the information from the Hungarian News Agency, are two girls, can be defended in freedom.
For compliance, you can receive up to 5 years of prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - is in preventive detention since Sunday .
The crime is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and co-meditation.
During the investigations, the 23-year-old youth had to be a large amount of 53-year-old man.
The accused did not want to pay his debt, so the Wednesday last week quoted his creditor to the office of an Ozd company, where he killed him and then killed the 9-year-old daughter of the victim.
According to MIT information, the young man has been prepared for the crime for a long time, because he did murder with a previously hidden weapons on the place of the crime.
The police analyzes with a expert on the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Varsovia Bolsa presented a offer for buying the Prague Bolsa
The Varsovia Values Bowl offered twenty million euros - about five million Czech Koreans - by 100 percent of the actions of the Prague Values Bowl.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Varsovia Values Bowl, confirmed the offer that the Polands did, although previously the cheques have excluded the Varsovia Bowl from the possible new owners of the Prague Borough.
The reason is that the Varsovia Bolsa is in the hands of the state.
99 per cent of the actions are in hand of the Poland State that within some months wants to sell 60 per cent of the same.
The Cheek Economic Journal E15 reported that the offer of Polands has been the highest among those who were offered by the Prague Bolsa.
According to the Czech press, until now they offered the Bolsa de Vienna, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Bolsa, the Stock Exchange of New York, the London Bolsa and the German Burse.
Petr Koblic, the chief of the Prague Values Bowl last week, declared that the worst new ownership would be the Varsovia's Varsovia's values and did not discover the possibility that, in a future disappear the Prague Values Bowl.
The experts calculate the value of the Prague Bolsa at about 5 to 10 billion coronas.
According to the actionist agreement, about 90 per cent of the actions could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Values Bowl is the Patricia Financance Investment Bank with a share of about 25 per cent, following the Bank Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
on the financial crisis from the view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their march comments on the increasingly deep financial crisis of the international crisis are talking about a "settled September 11th".
The global financial disaster should be the North American President - thinking the Republic of Rome - has not even been able to achieve the support of his own party for the draft law presumably made, which is the objective of resolving this unexpected situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", which I spoke of the multimillionary investor Warren Buffett, it is better to talk about a "seventh-seventh."
According to a part of the madrileña press, Washington is the exhibition key.
In view of the World's error of the United States' political direction, it was the one who led the global economy to the edge of the abismo.
It grows increasingly the danger of the demobilization of the North American monetary system and then will impact on the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the vote of the Congress, it is the danger that Washington does not offer a political instrument to address the crisis.
World economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the largest transformations of capitalism history is carried out.
You can't be opposed to this threat - put the Ginebra's Days-Anzeiger.
Some states today are still able to cut it out of savings to the smooth financial institutions, saving them so from the slaughter with the money of the contributors.
But if the domains will still be deleted, then no longer will be sufficient or new funds, nor the new impoversies.
The Member States of the European Union must leave their nationalist egoism and centralize control on fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received only the moon more than 100 billion euros - remembers the De Nor, adding that the more real concerns that, as the North Americans have done, European contributors should pay much money to solve the crisis.
The EU has not yet been seriously occupied with the crisis that happens as a smuggling by the Old Continent .
The "salvador" should not immediately present hundreds of millions of euros, but would be good if they are defined: In what cases the funds of the contributors are justified to avoid a worse?
Intelligent car imitate the flight of the householder
What would the best method to develop technologies to avoid colitions, if not the imitation of existing obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, the guests.
In a surprising project presented in the Japanese CEATEC, the awarders gave the start point to the Nissan engineers to design the next generation of colision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokio, designed the BR23C Robotic Robot Direction System of Nature, which gave him the features of the kitchen, with the final objective of establishing a system that can evacuate all colitions.
During the flight, each avenue creates its own special oval space that actually seems very much to our security protection capsules - explained in the Kazuhhiro Doi exposure, RP technological director and development and research.
They develop an important role of the eye composed of the wounds that are able to see in all directions in an angle above 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composed eyes, engineers used the measuring system by laser rays.
This identifies the obstacles before the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters in an angle 180 degrees, calculating its distance and sends a signal to the vehicle microprocessor that will immediately be transformed into a maneuver to avoid colision.
In a fraction of seconds the barrier is identified, then the vehicle robot imitating the switch movements, change the direction by turning the routes in the necessary measure.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is completely instinct.
"If it wasn't that, the vehicle robot could not react with the enough speed as to evacuate obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Labor and the project of vehicle robots.
It should be reacted immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable internal corner of the security protective capsules, in a cluster within which it is currently considered inevitable to all types of colisions.
Everything the process must reflect what makes a pleasant to earn others.
This process must be performed in an open and closed eyes.
However, on the other hand of the legs, the movement can not be moved above, down or diagnose, but can only be bidimensional and exclusively in the direction of the rounds.
Thus, instead of the unfinished possibilities for kitchens to shoot others, here only used as a possibility for the car robot the rotation movement and acceleration in addition to the fresh.
BR23C uses polymer lithium batteries that are lighter and more energy density, which means that they have a longer life duration than litio-ion.
According to Andoh, the importance is the instintive and intelligence reaction and not the data processing capacity, not much less than storage.
This device in each second should only process some entry signs and react according to the case.
It is not necessary to store these data or react with an instintive logical based on the data of the previous manuscripts, so only uses some decades of memory.
No memorys of gigabytes or megabytes are needed.
This is the first step to develop the technology to immediately equipte obstacles, which, according to the calculations of Nissan, can be incorporated within ten years of manufacturing models in series.
Another possibility for your application is to integrate the GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to his destination, earning the existing obstacles on his way.
He's already named this nice kid.
The written version of the financial savings package of $7,7 million was prepared in various phases to purchase bad credits from banks.
In the first phase, half of the money will be paid.
According to the East Coast's time during the new consultations held until midday night, the leaders of the Congress reached an agreement about the financial rescue package of $7,7 billion in total, after several days of discussion, reported Reuters.
We have achieved a significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, President of the North American Congress, said that it is not just formalized for agreement in a document.
The adoption of the package was supported by both candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking about the result of the commitment, stated: this programme will work and will be efficient, but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not to save Wall Street, but to give it back to the economy's car.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8 of the night, according to Washington’s time (or before two of the Monday's Monday, according to Central Europe), without making a spectacular salt in the bags.
On the draft law called emergency law for the economic stabilisation of 2008, the first Monday will vote the North American Congress and then Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi, and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress achieved during the night and we appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the portfolio of the White House.
The programme is different from the original proposal for Bush administration to pay $7,7 billion to purchase fund values for bad quality credit.
Now only half of the $770 million can be spent, using 250 billion immediately after the vote of the Congress, likely the Monday, the Ministry of Finance will purchase credit fund values, bad qualification and the destination of other $100 million depends on the decision of the President.
This programme will be monitored by a special body in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 million can be paid after a new Congress decision.
According to the Law, the Ministry of Finance may apply a combinated tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad, hypothetics and credit fund titles, as well as other "venvenous" credits.
The purchase can be made in substances or in direct form - have informed relevant persons from the Ministry.
The law allows the undertakings concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial card guarantees the concerning elements, for which the companys shall pay the amount corresponding to foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated that the law ensures the necessary financial resources, which can even reach $7,7 million to meet the urgent needs of the North American Financial System, to purchase bad financial means, to ensure their assurance or to prevent risks that could cause the demobilization of some major financial institutions.
We do everything that is necessary to be ready to introduce the law as they set it - accompanied.
Instead, the chiefs of the banks who are in sight and expect the State's aid may contain with the official limitation of their compensation, which the North American argot simply calls gold paracayed.
Only in certain cases the payment will be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of support of the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministerial purchase in the framework of a grant, an additional tax shall be imposed for gold paracay, unless the bank's failure head is judged.
When purchasing directly bad credits, the government will act aggressively in order to ensure that the compensation of heads is not exagerated.
In addition to that previous, the existing gold paracay contracts should not be changed, the limitations refer only to new contracts to stimulate also the participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the North American history that will be enforced by a legal limitation for the income of the Directors-General - commented this measure by the Democrat Barney Frank, President of the Committee of the Congress, responsible for financial services.
The State will also be entitled to purchase actions from banks participating in the programme, so that the risk of contributors will be reduced, as they can eventually even obtain profits from the transaction in the recovery of the economy and the bank.
According to the draft law in the next five years, the Chairman should submit to the Congress a proposal on the way to return the losses of the financial sector.
Of course, there was both sides who expressed their reserves on the project.
This is not what the North American citizens commanded us, i.e. they are not protecting the dollars of the contributors - declared the Republicn Congress in California, Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur stated: the measures urged it to be the same as they were responsible for the demobilization of Wall Street.

Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities to take place around 12 January the North American and Hungary agreement on the exoneration of visa - the minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about that in Chicago, before the Hungary residents there.
In its opinion "precisely everything depends on the construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic".

Like Obama and McCain want to demonstrate that they are more skilled than their rival to get out of the country of economic crisis.
According to the recent surveys, when the economic issues were planned first, Obama returned to a certain advantage and dismissed the advantage of McCain that had been obtained after the convention of the Republicans with Sarah Palin' candidate to the vice-president.

Press Journal of the German speech area
The right group is intact, only that within the own group the most conscious electors were converted - said The Spiegel about the weak electoral result of the CSU in Baviera.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a ruining coalition.
The spiegel (split.de)
In the electronic edition of the German magazine, Frank Walter, in its article titled "The Baviera Revolution dedicates his parents" analyzes the reasons of the CSU's devastated drama.
According to the well-known polytolog, the CSU's erosion had been launched long before Beckstein-Huber's triste duo had taken his duty.
The social Christians for several decades were developing in Baviera - and now these modern citizens are those who give it to it.
Change of a era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
The failure was not completely surprising for the CSU, but the Sunday ended a process that had been predicted for almost ten years: the insufficient hegemony of a state party was disappeared.
10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU obtained 47.7 per cent, for the first time below 50 per cent since the 50.7 per cent.
This has been repeated three years ago, in the 2005 federal elections, that is, yet, during the same time, it was Stoiber.
The reason why this is the respective modernization of the CSU in the devoring province of its progenitors .
Sociologs have been pronouncing this 40 years ago, but in the rythm they were very wrong, but the secularization, the results of the education and residence of the northern Germans in the developed regions of Baviera had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the CSU electors.
Modernization also increases the possibilities, and it also has political consequences.
The right group is intact, only within the own group, the most conscious, more critical and more captured electors.
It is surprising that in the past few weeks the conventional groups of citizens were more than the CSU; the autonomes, the small industrials, the bachillate and the diplomates.
Thus, at less than 40 per cent of the support to the CSU was recruited.
Press (depresse.com)
The Conservation Journal of Vienna: "Who with whom?" in its article entitled "The Presidents of the parties are very reserved in coalition issues" - is the confused situation of the internal policy after the Austrian elections.
The SPOP wants to negotiate with the EVP.
EBP prohibits that the SPOP is invaluable in its internal matters.
The BZÖ is open in all addresses to be negotiated, and the green green still do not want to consult coalition.
The elections were already held, now all around the coalition; at the debate held in the public television, the leaders of the party only let them see something of their barajas.
Warner Faymann, President of SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the EVP.
The SPUE wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties is possible - this already exists in certain provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the EVP, in the position of vicecanciller.
He stated that in any case the era of Schüssel-Molterer was disappointed.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted carefully to the red offers.
He said he will certainly not be able to achieve cooperation if Faymann tries to spend in the internal matters of the EBP.
It is still open on the party if they choose the opposition or enter into the coalition, these questions must be discussed in any of the OSP itself.
The President of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, opened in all addresses.
"In order to prevent the red-natural coalition, we are willing to take the government's responsibility" - said Haider.
Yaroka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equality has been started in Paris, its advisory is France that this year is also the President of the European Union.
Livia Yaroka, deputy of the European People ' s Party for Fidesz, in his full message, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called attention to the segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that are affecting the Guinean children and also the greatest obstacle to the prevail of their interests.
This high-level conference was inaugured - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities.
They attended the meeting of representatives of Governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights organizations.
Yaroka, according to the press office of the Fidesz Group in the European Parliament, warned that, in addition to the discrimination in employment, the Gymans remained outside the labour market first by their low-school level.
"The majority of young giantians have not ended the media and because of the bad quality of basic education, so only one insignificant part can get university diploma."
Yaroka also stressed that education, as fundamental human rights, has a decisive role in the prevailing enhancement of other human rights.
Investment in the education of giant children to a premature age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the European Deputy, these issues must be widely conciliated between the Guyana and the non-Giyans.
As soon as the school begins, a giant student will be more opportunities to become an active member of the labour market; through revenue taxes and consumption taxes will also contribute to the national budget.
"To the giant as citizens of the European Union, they must ensure the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of secret and low-level education," said Livia Yaroka.
According to the European Deputy, the objective and active unit of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate school desegregation processes, so it is essential that existing and planned anti-discrimination directives should be correctly implemented.
"They have to break the victory circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, there is a need to provide the possibility that the democratic space ensures that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights."
The objective of the European Summit for equal opportunities organized annually since the Berlin meeting last year in the sign of the "European Year of Equality" is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equality of opportunities at European and national level of Member States.
CSU: thanks for a transitional period
At the end of October, a decision will be taken on the success of the failure of Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral derogation, there have yet been no heads on the tops of the Bavarian CSB, and the debate on personal issues has been posted at the time.
Erwin Huber, the Chairman of the Partie and Sonther Beckstein, the first Provincial Minister still remain in his positions, but it is not known until when the grace will last.
The happiness of the duo, which has suffered a disastrous electoral catastrophic of 17 percent, will be decided at the extraordinary Congress of the party that will be held on the last weekend of October.
The integrators of this critical duo left interrupting: they do not so much to their posts.
In this way, they intended to calm the angry members of their parliamentary group and their basic organization, who one day after the "tsunami bávaro" requested personal consequences because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, who was on the top of his career - the Christian social unity reached a 60.7 percent, in change now, a year after the shooting against Stoiber, just 43.4 percent.
The CSU was 46 years old in Baviera, which gave 18 percent of the German PBI.
While in the province of the South, with key importance for the Hungary economy, conservators continue to predominantly, in the future without duty to coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the restructuring of the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agricultural, one of the possible successors of Huber, also has a place in the reduced intellectual group that begins negotiations with the Liberal FDP and the Legal Selectors on a possible governance coalition in Munich.
The strange of the destination is that in the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli's parliament, whose action against Stoiber was used for the shooting of the Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly removed from the scenario to the local political ambitious.
The CSU's maximum leaders are now investing all their energy to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber will also receive an active role that until now he moved the funds, the former provincial and former president of the CSU qualified on 28 September as the day of its political career.
The Monday Huber made some critical comments to the DDC, in his view, they would have much more supported the brother party.
Other CSU politicians also interpreted the derogation as a warning for the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the September 2009 Federal Tag elections, Merkel cannot be able to be shocked if they are not able to realize together with the CSU that played a transcendental role in the success of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, he could hide his deception for failure, the losses of the CSU will not negatively affect the large Berlin coalition.
What is of course relative: it will not be easy to treat the blessed CSU and the crisis of continuous social democrats.
The SPD with its 18.6 per cent has reached its worst result since 1946 in Baviera.
The opposition of Lukashenk: 110-0
After the elections of Sunday, there will be no opposing Member in the Belarus Parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and the stability guaranteed in the country of Alexandre Lukashenko, in turn, according to the Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe (OSCE), which is better explained by the violations of the law committed during the vote account.
OSCE, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral result.
While the legislation of the country of 10 million people, integrated by hundred and ten Members, has no opposition, before the elections to eve the unified opposition under the name of the Democratic Forces of the United Nations (ODSZ) expected that Lukashenko, who four times renewed his mandate after the elections of the 2006 questionnaire legitimacy, resulting in the change of the Constitution, would "accepte" the entry of some Members of the opposition in the Parliament.
Thus the ODSZ removed the boicot that he originally wanted to do.
In the fund of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which was more economically depending on Russia, who took a credit to modify the import of natural gas more likely in Russia and contributed to the sale in Russia of Beltrasgaz, the owner of the gas that passed by the country, wanted to improve its relationships with the European Union, which did not allow Lukashenko and the other high-level politicians to have an anti-democratic regime.
It was a sign of disappearance when the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, emphasized better on positive phenomena and not on the errors, for example, the prohibition of participating in a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the primary report of the Monday of the OSCE criticized even the same campaign, in which the candidates of the opposition could not appear in the press - and in particular that opposition could not be presented in the vote account.
With all this opposition, it is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners and Minsk are available to a small conflict with Moscow, rejecting the recognition of the separation of South Ocean of Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus theoretically represents a federal state, one month ago, which is considered the two regions as independent.
- We have made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has been launched - has declared to our journal Alexander Milinkevich.
According to the candidate for the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable to maintain this situation, although "the regime is afraid to allow the entry of such an opposition to this Parliament without weight".
The opposition is not planned to organize protests when seeing results, but try to reach the electors their message about the need to make economic reforms.
- This is clearly caused by many problems because we have to print the press of the opposition in Russia, local authorities make difficulties before their distribution, but I see even so that they are increasingly those who support the change between the older age also - said Milinkevich, making the allusion to Lukashenko regime, which believes that their main result is the creation of social security, they do not even consider the juveniles, which are officially the most subsidied by the regime.
Since the country's debt and the increase in trade deficit is only timely the decomposition of social security which "seeks the silence of the cementarys" - said Milinkevich.
The Russian observers against the opposition policy qualificated democraticly to elections.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, declared the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "The people do not believe in the words but in the facts," so that the lack of opposition is not another thing than the witness of the mature of Belarus electors.
Brunetta: "Despite now, you'll be disappointed before you start working"
It has never occurred in the Palacio Chigi History that they put automatic doors to control the entry and output of the staff.
But since today it starts with this measure against whom you fix and then go to the bar to take a coffee in work time.
This newness has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary-General of the Council's Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"Automatical doors say Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" requires the minister.
"A new time of responsibility and transparency is now opened.
This is Reformism", underlined by Brunetta.
With Palacio Chigi, the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Council's presidency.
For Masi "the selection of the automatic doors is also important from the symbolic view point".
No resistance was found by employees, assured the secretariat-General: "he has been a change shared by workers and has been the cooperation of the employees."
Finally, not more work-time breakfast; no longer coffee and medium-moon.
The word of Brunetta, which suggests, is: "A good capuchon at 7 of the morning is a holy hand."
During a convention at the High School of Public Administration
in Rome, the minister says that "in three months the absences for public employees have been reduced by 50%, it means 600,000 people more than work in a year."
And adds that public Administration must be more effective
Italian, "the wage dynamics – the Minister explained – in the past 8-10 years have been dual in respect of the private sector and well above the inflation level".
For now, millions of public employees have been joined to oppose the standards of the Brunetta Decree by adhering to the request supported by the Codacons.
"When the Minister of Public Function shows numbers, the less autentic work for the cause of disease – writes the association of consumers – the people of the 'vagos workers' is continued to increase .
In Italy, millions of employees of the correct and productive public administration have been united to declare war with the egitimate decree standards."
In particular, the Tar would be responded to the exclusion of economic treatments accompanied by illness due to service; the extension of the time-by-care visits of the nursing employee and other aspects contained in the new provisions laid down by the minister.
Labour accidents, Napolitano: "Decisive Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents, 3 people died and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data actually confirmed that white deaths have been about 1.200.
Numbers that demonstrate the gravity of a phenomenon which is one of the main causes of death and cause nearly a double of deaths in respect of murders.
To encourage the attention of institutions, social forces and information about this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates the 58th national day in all provinces of Italy by victims of labour accidents institutionally established on October 2.
"The worried data distributed by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm as critical as to the question of prevention in the work", says the President of the Napolitan Republic, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, Mutilated and Invalid National Association, Peter Mercandelli.
The head of the State expresses its "gratitude for the continuing associative commitment to prevention in the place of work, protection of lesioned workers, assistance to the families of victims and the sensibilisation of public opinion".
"A 'basta' has been demonstrated, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by its size, are raising the clamper of the media and the participation of the public view, instead of the cotidian reality, we propose dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that " there is no doubt a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is to take the numerous school initiatives for a more direct consciousness of young people in the world of work.
It is a duty to maintain the attention to the phenomenon, not to strike the alarm on social gravity, to apply and to improve legislative standards.
By its part, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths are an absolute social emergency, which opposes the conscience of each of us and imposes all institutions a decisive effort to spend an urgent end."
"The data on the accidents in the work seem to indicate a slight and slow path, but this doesn't want to make the number of white deaths too impressive", noted the President of the Anmil Peter Mercandelli.
"We do not really want that this "reducing tension" is translated in less attention, because it is just when the attention decreases the tragedy.
"We believe that at the general level is still too little to combat the phenomenon of accidents and the media can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, at our criteria - Mercandelli has emphasized - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the school world. "
"It is a further effort - he has added - in order to concentrate the communication and awareness of the public view.
But, above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibilities by employees about a phenomenon representing social emergency."
Mercandelli has declared "the progressive deterioration of the subsidiary protection level for the victims of the work" and the "assistant deficiency to which the system is directed in the past years".
"The goal is to return to the employer's security - he has added - because the luck of whose accident is not to have to depend on the gift available by the legislator every time."
Mp3 readers in charge, risk hearing
Listen to high volume music for a long time using portable musical devices like Mp3 readers can cause permanent lessons to hear.
It is regarding the European Commission, which, in a disseminated communication in Brussels, refers to the opinion of the Scientific Commission of emergency and recently identified health risk (Csserri) of the Ue, published today.
"This scientific opinion – read in the note – shows that 5-10% of those who, for at least five years, listen to music with portable musical devices per week more than one hour per day by holding high volume devices have a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I'm worried that such a high number of young people who use frequently portable musical devices and cellular phones at high-level can inconsistently ruin their ears in an unremeditable way", says Meglena Kuneva.
"Withful tests – continue the responsibilities Ue – emerges a clear risk and we must react quickly.
Whatever accounts, it is to acknowledge consumers and to make this public domain information.
We should also review the existing control systems on the light of this scientific view, so that they are widely effective and that they have steps with the new technologie."
Bruxel had requested the Independent Scientific Committee to consider the problem, seeking the great use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the rude that it originates.
" Scientifics - concludes the Executive Ue – confirm that it is a cause of concern, and the European Commission will now consider together with Member States and interested parties that measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure from portable musical devices and devices. "
Today, there is already a European security standard that limits the speed level of the portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as an auditive damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of smile.
These damages can be limited by recurring to solutions such as the reduction of levels and the time of speech exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee you pointed out that the users of portable music devices listen to high volume (ma 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limit in force regarding the maximum permitted sound in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions, but long-term periods, cause a permanent loss of auditive capacity after a 5-year period.
It means that 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the UE.
Rome, German guides the Commission for the future of capital
Today, in March, the accounts will be opened in June.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the capital of Rome" which has been established this morning in its new seat behind the Charcalla Terms.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission discussed the main points for Rome.
Once we closed the doors in March, the joint and the Joint Council evaluate analysis and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "Official Ballo" of the Municipality and its intended Gianni German.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – aimed at sublineing German – must provide proposals for the development of Rome, where those who are politically decided, together and the municipal advice can then be defeated.
There is no sovereign role position, just the will to have a place where to develop a great project for Rome.
The work will be lost in March, because this experience must have a precise period of time.
In June – announces the purpose – we will present the strategic plan by using the Commission's work for the future of the capital of Rome."
The complaint of the Commission of Inutile, since its opinions are not binding, German answers: "All depends on the work that will be able to implement the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission, and I am also sure in Rome, its support will be essential.
The policy is almost always in the ordinary and emergency management, which are backwarded..
We, on the contrary, want to look over there and for a long-term perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
The aim of Rome is also to point out that "This Commission is not an inutility or a banality: it is absolutely free, does not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to participate and raise the best minds expressing the capital."
For Germany, in fact, "It is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or inmovil, to allow our city to make a real level salt, from which we have absolute need, thinking with an unilateral spirit to their future."
A future that, needed the purpose of Rome, would not only be limited to the current common borders but also look at it "not only in the optic of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital, but also in view of the role that Rome can and must develop as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
The first anti-American president.
He wrote a American political note that is interested in spend independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions cleaned the United States economy and the tube relationships (as he also do today from private citizens) with the Islamic enemy."
Increased attacks against Obama while the date of election is near.
he wrote a woman of Miami on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great face of stone: he believes he wins the highest charge of the nation that has had two rulers and five black senators!".
They are in fact attacks that do not say much; they are clearly racial attacks and do not respond to the question of the electors: will it be a good president? And they are the sondees; everyone say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case there is also one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
One journal of the Mississippi, in the sides of the south of the United States, wrote a editorial: once in the chain to vote, we will know who will vote the American patriot.
Get out of a side of the US mentality covered up to the last.
"True what you want, we'll think about where the cross is, if about Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if we get Obama, we'll go from America.
This is never before now, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasons, the winning weapons for the Democratics is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the errors made by Bush during their mandate? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent it home to casts in the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and Americans have not been forced to make the valves.
Similarly, Irak for most has been the weak point of Bush.
Whoever will assume the position of George W will have a huge duty to develop.
Using, the economic fall is also feeling for journalists: in the newspapers it is time of cuts. Many gives the Internet's fault, "assis" of the printed paper.
Five American journalists have been interpeled by PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pesimists about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared to feel less concerned about the credibility.
You don't feel isolated as once.
The problem for American journalists is money, money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, the courts carried out in the room where the editors work to carry out the newspaper, is a great problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to interviewed journalists, if the traditional journalism, as the majority of the public understands, is substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pesimism predominant today about the American journalist.
Six over ten journalists and executives are convinced that periodism at the national level follows a wrong way.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Implementation against emissions.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest editorial houses are opened up a break on the Internet, for many views like the "assistant" of the printing letter.
The "economic pressure" that the journalists warned has increased up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are brewing the technology in hope "what do something good" by journalism.
The largest root today in the American journalism is among whom the newspapers – or directors – and the journalists working for them.
56% of the national executives are certain that their journalists share the same values, while at local level the percentage lows to 23%.
For some of this, you must see the "security of the work".
The executives that think to lose work in 3 years are 47 per cent at national level.
The periodic staff is 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always at the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a major country like the United States, with 300 million people and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and Internet employees often offer what they want and become a question of "total or leave it".
The directors receive almost always good payments, while the editors can win up to $10,000 per month, but the jubilation and social security.
For holidays, the reasoning is complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 days after a number of years.
But American journalists, by their appointment, are "held" followed during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL OF ROMA, COPPOL TO THE CHAPTER IN GROTTAFERRATION
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the immobiliary Danilo Coppola that he had requested to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Copy this shocked banking in the field of anti-contraction investigation on the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the arrest process on his charge, last week, he obtained home release, transforming it into obligatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentilni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested the real estate to recur the road from the city of province to a capital room.
According to the court, these travels (for which the pm has voted on the other) would enable him to influence your society and access the evidence they condemn it.
Elites in danger
The phenomenon had already been shown a few days ago with the vote of the representatives' camera against the rescue plan of $700 million launched by the White House: a significant part of the Americans was, and this, but is interested in punishing Wall Street to save the economy.
He confirms the New York Times last night reports that the current crisis is disarmed by the Republican party, always, but shared between its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and community business institutions, and its new soul, in change, conservatory, enemy to the "featers of Washington" and the world of the financials, strongly overcome in the states of the Centre and South.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotent with the voice of whom he spoke to the principle.
This is only a example of the changes, the major mutations, which the current economic earthquake announced: not only in the United States but also in all Western and not only here.
It seems to be in the United States as in Europe for many years as incubating phenomena that with the new climate they solidate and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the renovation, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double state-sovereign category in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of bank-financing institutions, which have, if, strong relationships with the outside, but above all, are more compromised with the balances of families living in a single country and in a single state.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for whom she governs is, namely, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and the families that, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears economically, but it is politically and exclusively national.
Politicalism seems to be substantially outside the game or have no lot to say: the crucial test is the European Union that is divided as always between the different interests and the different state strategies does not reach any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that all are expected to have an intervention, rescue plans and reactivation, new rules and above all the funds granted: since the court is only the state that has the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to reduce things.
They also have the necessary means and legitimation to be used: two incalculable resources, values in certain circumstances where no market probably and no organization can never be available in the same measure.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-nation is in perfect synthesis, with the greatest importance when the new development of the economy aims to allocate it to a very linked factor: territoriality.
Paradogially, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of technology, always but sophisticated, of the inmaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already intended to dominate the world, we realized that our future will always make the accounts with little inmaterial things such as water, culture and oil.
Everything that may be certainly transported from one place to the other of the land, but are also bound in an absolutely circumscribed space, a territory.
So who is a sovereign, he certainly has many more letters about whom it is not, and whoever has the disgrace to live in an uncultural place without oil and without water.
I'm coming to the second novity but I'm taking a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitablely says policy and leadership.
In this regard, economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective conscience of the need for a leadership is the request of some who knows to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredited for existing leaders, inadequate economic species with many dark areas.
And together something more deeply and in a certain worried sense: a discredited, intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of lejany, which aims to imply all the leading class of the Western countries in a growing number.
It seems to be more advanced, in various places of the population, the conviction that before its actions are the same as those of the social elites until now, the same way to feel and be, their culture in understanding terms, to have done the same time and to be more strange to the views of the majority.
The demand of leadership, in a few words, is subterraneously a ratified but powerful movement of the leadership and the traditional political structures that are shown in an electional "revolutory" or in the slowly changes of collective humor of these last days, from the conservative outcome in Austria-Baviera to the failure of the social-democratic consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American congress against Bush (and also with the victory of the right in Italy which has something to see).
It is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rides, their newspapers, their reliable intellectuals, their format would say somewhere, make it more difficult to understand and then represent, what has been taken today is the deepest roads of Western society and that the economic crisis renewed, growing and potentially affected.
Before all this speaking of a "mass rebellion" today is frankly exagerated.
But have open eyes, surely not.
The super piece to walk on the walls
Winning the serious laws thanks to a super pigment and in a future walking on the walls like the aran man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and a team of four institutions has now been very closed.
With an adequacy of only 2,5 cm squared scientists could have taken a body of 100 kg on a vertical wall.
The American Journal of Science has published the discovery of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the researchers team is an evolution of existing that uses a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of the pigment can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a spaguetis pile” explains Zhong Lin Wang from Georgia Institute of Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired the shoes of gecos, rebuilt from the microscopics that can ensure the animal's perfect adherence.
The tests about different materials such as the glass, the twin and the paper of liya have shown that the new adhesive is ten times but powerful of the pieces of this piece and at the same time" is easily out of the walls" Liming Dai, researcher of the power of the Engineering University of Dayton.
COMINAR ON THE PAREDES? -"This material could be useful as transitory adhesive" adds Liming Day.
You can walk through the walls exactly like the araña man? You know, but researchers think about a very less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubs are heat and electric flow drivers.
Other applications might have to be considered with the airspace engineering.
For the moment, nothing of superheroes.
OTRA INVESTIGATION - also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to searching for a new adhesive.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers have presented an adhesive fact of micro fibers as powders that are cleaning the powder during the movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adherence.
Pharmacies: never with fruit game
Attention to the pommel juice, the naranja and the snack.
These drinks, mostly consumed in summer because they are refreshing and rich of vitamins, if they are taken together with some medicines, change their absorption by simplifying or decrease according to the case, efficiency with serious health consequences.
Repeating the risk of fruit juices, freshly associated with the absorption of some medicines David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in the course of Filadelphia, sent a new alarm: enough pomele, naranja and manzana vessels to reduce absorption of some medicines, cancelling the beneficial effects and risking the health of patients.
Pommel game was already under charge because it was retained responsible for increased toxic levels some antiarrithmic, antibiotic, angiolytic, antihistaminical and neuroological medicines.
FARMACOS RIESGOS – The same Italian pharmaceutical Agency had given the news in a board of information two years ago by alarming doctors and patients not to subsist the risk resulting from this mixture and to take care of what drinks are taken in the case, such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NEW SOLO POMELO – According to experts, the naranja juice and the manzane contained substances that inhibit medicines.
A large list of active principles imposed by pommel and other games.
From here, the call by Michele Carruba, Director of the pharmacology Department of the State University of Milano: "This discovery is generally indicated to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies that may eventually enable to change the information notes of the same.
Thus, it is always necessary to read the illustrative brochures of the medicines that are living and if there is something that is not clear to us, let us not be impressed, ask the doctor or the pharmaceutical” underlined the experts of the Ansa Agency.
The Economic News to Paul Krugman
The nobel economic premium has been assigned to the American Paul Krugman for its studies, trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neighbor who teaches Princeton University and is a New York Times editorial notes.
Krugman is one of the most critical of Bush administration decisions on economy and external policy.
A few months after the arrest of 11 September 2001, Krugman had planned in a editorial published by New York Times that the second event would be but decisive that the first, in the result terms for the United States.
A prediction that defeats a lot of polyemics and that for several years has been reprovated to the economy, but that is now clear.
"I'm surprised and a little sharp of how the memory of Enron and Worldcom's failure scandal have disappeared rapidly from the public's attention," Krugman stated at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economist of great value", but also a distributor with a very aggressive style, especially critical against the excess of the liberalism of Bush administration."
Open Office, edition of the third edition of the package'anti-Microsoft'
It is the day of the OpenOffice.org 3.0 launch, the open source of personal productivity that aims to attract always but users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work of voluntary developers, which are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several news: to the Welcome screen and the less largest revised interface, are added other more consistent, such as the compatibility for the Mac OS X operational system and support for the new ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2, the last ISO standard version.
Attention also to multi-operation with the Suite Office 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.doach, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as which allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentation, for example, to send it electronically, or to import the PDF file into the graphical processing module, by maintaining the original aspect of the page.
Always on this background can be created "Hybrid PDF" documents that cumulate the typical graphic of Adobe with the elements of a calculation sheet or text editor.
Cooperation is a element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet, they may be involved in different users, avoiding change conflicts, in the development of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some enterprises are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the web (on the cloud on the clouds) and should give the final result in the next weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded in the address http://it.openoffice.org/download/0.0/download300.html and is added to the English that was found in the view since Wednesday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is available for the Linux operating system.
A request can also be sent the cd of installation to home or to work.
And if the theme of free can be a gang for dissemination in houses, it is in business field that Open Office is the test suite, try the big platform, and can already be counted with several projects in public administration and schools.
And not even the realities offering an ideal training, consultation and assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business perspectives could be opened.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the calculation sheet that replaces Excel; Impress for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of known Access is the program that allows to work on the base date; and last Draw the graphic module.
Objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and it is likely that we have reached nearly 3 600 million, with the output of the new version, it is possible to exceed the expected number.
Also Kohl result is the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the tour of France: it is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, team Gerolsteiner, the third classified and winner of the best squadr.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper La Team.
Kohl, 26 years of age is the fourth positive corredor at the Epo of Third Generation, after the Italians Riccardo Riccô and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also they from the Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of the carbon blood camps enter between those carried out in the last few weeks in the Lab of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the contrary tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third position to the Tour and smile against the two years of canonic discalling.
To confirm the positive doping news of Kohl to the Epo of the third generation is the chief of the French antidoping Agency, Peter Bordry, who stated to the Associated Press that he informed the news to the Austrian authorities.
Austria has 26 years of age been located in the podium at the edges of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, joining the best scatter.
INMIGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES ON PREGNANT, ITALIA ON RIGHTS?
Italy of migrant country has only been transformed recently in a privileged destination for immigrants" accepted with hostility.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a country of racists? It is what the New York Times is asked in a long article that has been dedicated to the debate on racism in Italy by part of the case of the young Abdul William Guibre originating Burkina Faso murdered in Milan for having robbed a galletite box.
This case shows what the New York Times defines the "south paradoxe": the northern regions are at the same time where "mas integration and work" are registered but also the highest anti-immigrant feeling of the country and the highest support of the Northern link."
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times also quoted intolerance episodes in Milán, Parma, Rome, Cimpino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also, the new legislation aimed at immigration and facilitate the expulsion of citizens is quoted as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
Tendence is marked by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Napolitano, found in Benedicto XVI at the Congress, has asked that the State and church work together to fight racism."
Training students of the car hire accommodation, up to 900 euros for a room
The market for universities does not know the crisis.
According to Sunia’s last survey, a private room was able to accommodate a 900 euro student in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Napolis, 600 to Rome.
"The phenomenon has already taken very serious features until the point of excluding the right to study a large part of young people for the high costs that the family would have to support – explaining the responsibility of the Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities, the strong demand has completely deformed the market to develop a generally increased process to residenties."
In addition, in most cases, there is a series of violations: typical contracts, unregistered, without limiting of canon, under linked equipment.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions can be regulated through the review of tax taxes.
Seeing the survey, we see that in Milan, by a bed in Brisa area, there are approximately 450 euros; by a single room from at least 650 (Narre zone) to a average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria zone).
In Florence a bed costs a average of EUR 350/400, a room around 700.
In Bolivia, where students are concentrated in the nearby university areas, 250/280 euros serve a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 per individual.
In Rome in central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bolonia) you request some 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only less but low values ($550 per individual room) in areas near other universities (Ostiense and Science).
Economy is only if it changes the peripheral area: EUR 300 per bed and 450 per individual room in the Prenestina area, Centokelle and around.
In Nápoles for a bed you are 300/450 euros, for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed, you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 per individual.
in the towns but girls prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a higher weight in the city economy.
In cities like Perugia, where the phenomenon of accommodation to students and foreign students is more frequent, a further anomaly is recorded: an increase of 25/30% of canon to foreign students regarding Italians.
Welcome to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historical rooms
The historical cinematographic rooms closed by encouraging the multiplex.
"A city without film rooms in a blind city, is like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornator is effectively photographing what is happening in the major Italian urban centres and also in the cities of province.
The marginalization process of Chineses, which is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the features of a true cultural crime, with the birth of the great meticons in Periferia and the consequent departure of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city.
Until almost always are historical places, full of memory", such as if he died a friend, a known part of which was shared with a place and so emotion," observes the director of the new Paradise cine, the film that had been twenty years ago wins the first Oscar and the great prize of the jury to Cannes, which accounted for the poesie of a provincial movie and nostalgia for the way to live the movie that may have lost forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of commercialists are clearly speaking: in the past five years they closed 316 traditional Chineses, and most of them are over the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Napolis, Boloni and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions but suffered by the clores are the first, Emilia-Romaña with 82 chines less, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsibilities of their disappearance are the avenue of multix, these three Italian regions that have made recording the largest number of new metic kids: 195 pantals but in Lombardia in the past five years, 81 are in Toscana and Emilia-Romaña.
“Italic exercise has been irrationally developed” observes Paul Protti, President of Anec, would be useful to build new structures, but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of those already existing, because when a town room closes, not all its frequencies are ready to be transferred to the meticons.
For not talking about the lack of funds for traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is confused from the ethics and moral views, that the government does not respect existing laws.
In order to support the sector, it would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year."
In the case of Bolivia, the first Italian city concerned with the clores, he decided to repair with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the mono chamber is in the historic centre and in the Periferia.
Among the planned standards exist a mediated tax facilitation for public managers and benefits in terms of mobility: spectrums can enter the limited traffic area and have special tariffs for the station.
"It's a initiative I like," observes Giuseppe Tornator, and I hope that other cities continue the example of Bolonia by putting up other measures.
It is true, in contrast with the extra power of the meticons, traditional rooms must improve the quality of sound and image because the public is now more demanding.
The defense of traditional cine is a theme that was always important for me: the closure of the cine of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the chispa that convinced me to carry out the "New Paradise cine" which I had been thinking for 10 years.
I lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk before the Rialto or the Cyril of National Trade already closed, where I lived so many shared emotions, to not see the cards covered by the powder, I turn to the other side."
Lazo between policy and randheta, the Chamber of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The alcalde of Gioia Tauro was available to uniformize the elections of the Municipal for interested people in the Piromalli coast."
The accusers of the Antimaphia Directory of Calabria give the intending and vice-president of Goia Tauro Giorgio From Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafious association.
Also arrested Joacchino Piromalli, the intermediate elder between the clan and the public administration, and his grandfather, the boss' honour, already condemned by mafious criminal association and compensated 10 million euros.
"Depreciation of any legal and moral standards, and in good sense," the applicants write, the two local administrations had expressed the will of paying consultations to the lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been permitted to the mafious family – they write the judges - to be officially in the within of the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration. "
The Chairman of the Regional Coalition Agazio Loiero does not hide that "The agreements between the bad organized life are a lot" in its region: "There are areas where mafious intensity is stronger than others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians that resist the pressure of the "andrangheta, heroes that keep clean."
The arrests of this morning are accompanied to those of the last July after the police had announced the head court of the mafious Piromalli family.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, in 1991 and always by presuming conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been subjected to the load of administration of the municipality.
Jorgio Dal Torrione, intendingly, from the Udc at the time of the dissolving, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as a leader of a right centre coalition.
I exploit a scandale when the Prefecture orders the dissolving of the municipal Council.
I call on the vice-minister of the internal, who was Marco Minniti at that time, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to request the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions held at Dal Torrione, judges write, "the availability to support the requirements of a entrepreneur, representing a very close group of Piromalli clan, harmonizing the elections of the public administration on the interests of mafious families."
When the energy is born from the oaks, the greats are down in the scene
It is an exterminated increase that is more than 70% of the planet's surface and are now discovering it, the great world energy companies.
Those, flows, mares are the new renewable sources on which they look like Chevron.
The possibility of recursion of marine movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, the investigations have been intensified.
When the price of oil low, in 1980, the idea of use of marine energy was separated, but now the environmental cases and the new increase of oil makes an impulse to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the global electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of the sea halls.
This amount would be the double of the production currently produced by the nuclear centers.
And it would be the flights and the seas.
Gringing to the attack.
The first company to support marine energy has been Enersis, which 2005 has undertaken an agreement to build an implant in the northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it was a revolutionary step.
At two years of distance to support marine energy are always but among these companies that have always voted through traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the ocean energy technology - he has declared the portion of a company associated with the United States oil in the American Economic Journal Wall Street Journal – and it is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation concerned is about the obtaining a permission of the United States energy committee to implement a project to explore marine energy in Alaska.
It is a quite important sign, if the EU continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to implement new perforation.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and New Jersey Ocean Power to follow the way energy coming from the sea, the total invested until now, although not detailedly indicates an increased interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about a technology still starting, because marine energy is no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, the effects such as Portugal or Scotia are slightly dimensional and they do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
In order to produce a wide range of energy, a technology should be used with a greater environmental impact.
And options are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of good associations between them.
The force of the balls, which makes move the goods up and down, becomes hydroulic pressure with pistones and cylinders inside the same.
The pressure makes a turbine turning a generator at its time.
The electricity is sent to the coast through submarino cables.
For now, four of this type's implants in development, at the expectation of the federal approval, in addition to energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, in turn, already produces energy for a commercial centre and for a station, using submarin turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement when there are merries, it turns the balls of the turbines, creating a rotative movement that produces the generator.
Verdant said he has a long list of customers at waiting for the authorisations required to use energy.
After the shoes, the shoes.
A particular interest, they say in the Electronic Energy Development Institute, is now the potential of marine.
Although it is a intermitting phenomenon, the marines are more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the oils, and therefore, but reliable as the source of energy.
It is mainly about the energy of the marines, such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others near the coasts, has invested $7 million in 2008 and is expected to be investmentd in $35 million for 2009.
