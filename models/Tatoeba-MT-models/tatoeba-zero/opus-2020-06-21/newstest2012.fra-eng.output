Parliament has not ratified the amendment for Tymosenko's release
The Ukrainian Parliament rejected, under an amendment to the criminal law, the draft cancellation of the paragraph on the infringement of Julia Tymosenko, the Chief of the Opposition.
The deputy refused in second reading the draft amendment for the reduction of punishment for economic crimes, which could open the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to seven years of prison for having concluded an unsuccessful agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The court is not definitive, and the court must act on the appointment of the sentence in December.
Tymosenko qualified the political vengeance judgement of the regime and has also caused a trial-partial suspicion process in the West.
The draft to cancelle paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 Members.
It would have been 226 votes for approval.
libyenne winner
Libyan Liberation or rebellion has already tried.
Muammar Kaddafi is entered in a unknown place in the wilderness, and without him the war has been finished.
It's still to determine the winners.
As it is cotume in the region, election winners are Islamic, but they are moderate or radicular.
The Provisional National Council has decreased the ordinary law of Charia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a country without criminality because a flight is cut off.
Women can forget emancipation, the unrespectable events of their faith are passive of capital punishment...
This is the Coran who will join in the place of the dictator's personality the company composed of opposite tribes.
In Libya, it will rule a order as we cannot represent it, and as we would certainly not.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and probably would not be advantageous for the Libyans.
It is especially surprised that Islamic warriors accepted the aid with recognition of the unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not a American General who directed the NATO's shocks but instead God whose size they celebrated at each attack.
So when it is to search for winners in Libya, the western is not part of it
We participated in the tissue, servicing Islam and our peculiarity have been distracted from the dictator as a political alliance without any benefits.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militaryly occupated by Libya.
So there is no problem for locals to cut off "crossed".
Is that without soil occupation, oil companies will easily be accessed to the black Libyan gold.
It may not, and the western will finally be able to avoid a decent protection of human rights.
For little to prevent these adeptes of the chariot.
A new crisis era begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the investors' visor.
A round of statistics has passed on Tuesday in Europe.
Each of the states published the reliable information to the GDP for 3A.
The Czech economy has staged this last quarter while France and Germany are growing.
The compulsory market covers all records.
Investorers are not only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The Euro Area Statistics Offices, Germany, Czech and other countries of Europe have previously published their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP has a planned growth of 0.5 per cent, the France's 0.4 per cent.
The two countries have changed data for the second quarter during which Germany was better than planned (0.3 per cent instead of 0.1 per cent instead of expected), however, France made a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (the question was to the origin of stagnation).
Czech economy has grown by 1,5% during the third quarter.
But the GDP has been staged and, according to the Czech Statistics Bureau, it is confirmed that it is directed to a progressive reduction in economic growth.
The results are worse than analyst previsions.
The most important events:
Czech economy has increased 1.5% during the third quarter, but has been stagnated during the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy has increased 0.5% according to the scheduled and periodically revised data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union has increased 0.2% between July and September in comparison with the previous quarter, as a result of analysts.
The Greek economy has decreased 5.2%.
10-year-old income is 28.45%
Income from the obligations of Spain and Italy are being shocked to critical limits.
Problems start to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The income of the Czechic obligations remains below 4 per cent while the situation is in the region.
The ECB should be the safeguard of the last instance .
The Czechs were qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate qualification for 200 million
The football representation succeeded its harder mission in the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the Super Cech and Garden Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football was carefully defended with a good part of chance in the second part of its qualification and will not miss Europe's championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed reporting.
No special excitation during the first part and a large part of chance for the second.
The Czech representation also wined by the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification for the Championship of Europe.
The mountains were found under pressure until the second part because of a specific Czech defence.
The triggers of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who gave two chances to mark a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech, the Czech representation will not be excluded in the Championship of Europe in the next year, and also a reward of 200 million corones in the Czech football box.
From the first minutes we played a warball football.
The two teams were difficult to mount combinations and the game was mainly focused around the central line.
The pressure of the national footballers has not occurred in the Czech Defense that has responded exactly to long tits even during the first half-time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a human bouclier
Several hundreds of high school students have created a human bouclier around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support the nuclear programme of their country towards a possible Israeli assault.
Students began to pray at midday before the site and then desired the death of the EU and Israel.
Several hundreds of students from the universities in Spain have created a mardi human bouclier around the nuclear technological center of Spain where the uranium is transformed.
They thus expressed openly that they would defend the nuclear programme of their country in danger of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) observed in its last information that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapons.
In Israel there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear institutions.
Students began to pray at midday before the site and then desired the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose aim would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where the uranium is ruined.
Food of a child obey: not take a small dinner and take the charcore for dinner
More than a third of the children from 9 to 13 years of age have superpoid problems, 9% of schools have a weight above the average and 5% are obtained.
As the current research shows, obedient children come from families who have a malade lifestyle.
This again shows the importance of the environment in which it evolves to be human and the models that it turns.
For example, in the tables of obsessed children, 50% is more often found than in children's families at normal weight.
19% of the obsess had food at dinner according to the investigation carried out with awareness action "Observity is not an accident"
In the biggest families, sport is not also a custom, which is now the case of most of today's schools - only 15% responded that at least once a week the parents found the time for active movement.
Inquisition under 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and participated in 900 primary schools in Czechia.
It was the second edition of "Observity is not a chair", action supported by the General Health Assurance and the Unilever Society.
Since the beginning, more than 12000 students from the sixth to the third were registered in this project.
One of the determinant factors that cause dramatic increase in the number of superpoid children, or obsessed, is the absence, a correct and not enough physical exercise.
"Solo half of the children concerned shows, for example, eating 5 times per day - dinner - dinner - a dinner, which is the basic principle of good food," says one of the results of the investigation.
Without a little dinner and charcoter at dinner
Specialists focused on the fact that for healthy development, some basic details such as a small family dinner at the same time need.
In Czech only 23% of the families of students eat at my same time.
In the largest part of the family, each one takes his small dinner alone.
And the worst that has been said is that a tenth of the population does not take a very small dinner.
However, the small dinner is the basis of a good daily food.
The questionnaire showed that in the familys of obedient children more often consumption of sick fresh.
Almost each student - without talking about weight - drink every day of sugar drinks (70%).
More than 40% of the children concerned are regularly sports but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepar your food
Another part of the survey allowed children selected (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare their own food from opportunities proposed according to their own guest and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years are far away, at the plan of healthy food, of ideal."
Among their favorite plates there are many meats, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is, in particular, a large preference for sugar limonades", is indicated in the results of the investigation.
To dinner these are the skins that took the first place just before the white meat.
Children do not want feculents and preference for fish and vegetables was very low.
Healing on health
The investigation also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of control of a group of participants to the investigation that had filled the questionnaire after the sensibilisation session "Observity is not a accident", the results of the investigation have been attended by a well-determined will to lead to a healthy food.
For example, the most marked has been for sugar limonates since children began to give consumer water preference.
Childs were most often covered on the questionnaire the white meat and fish as the main plate and would reduce the sugar plates and the "knedliky" (Czech speciality of bread sweat or land poms).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for the stylists, I have put a little angry of the fact that there was a lot since the beginning.
I didn't think about what would happen next.
The exhibition of three specialists of speciality, personal housing and a seminar on what happens.
And it'll be worse.
We are closer to final reviews and waiting for practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courses the same day and Sunday is really "boured".
This time we treated with the Alenka Director (we have no boys) in order to smell the woman who has no standard mention.
And women of this kind is most.
One has a small cock, the other one a boy's body, without special curve, one of the superpoids.
The stylist must know how to optically adjust large arms, extend a cup or well to add the necessary curves.
We have thus come to rejoice the personality and also not to have too seen kinds of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong sweet and pronounced hacks and a fine size.
For example, if there is a difference between the size and the shoes in such a way as the shoes or pants do not pass out of all, the shock is to do it in measure.
And you will not regret it because the swimming swimming smell is inevitable.
In a measuring juice you'll feel much better than in the swimming, swimming and do not hold the ceinture and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can be allowed to make Tucker style with coated tissue pieces, or even broders.
Of course, there are many examples of different appearances and I am glad I have the whole week to take all the information received.
But I'm also afraid I had to do what I have to do at home too much.
Each season receives a celebration for the day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality mode and its appearance.
I should "hail" Miranda Kerr, that maybe you know about the Victorian Secret.
I am pleased, because it's better than living in Briney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who took about 100 kilometres of these last days (not take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and cover from magazines or search on the Internet, print and work graphism.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
It is also important to reflect on the graphic part of the styling.
The styleist does not only have the physical but also creates the productive pages in the magazines (for example, the trends for hands, mantels, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, a styleist and graphist, has maintained us all of this.
But this,... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three specialities invited a variety of aspects at the Sabbath Meeting of information on the various types of persons.
Honza Pokorny, Stylelist, Jakub Polanka mode graphist and Ben Renc, mode photo.
Jakub recalled us that mode is a illusion and the styleist should know how to use it.
And a talent stylist can work with a single habilement in a different way.
The variability is for this primary example.
For example, this tritch-coat that must be taken classically with a jean and a t-shirt as a light mantel, but it can also have the nucleus body, with scarpins and take it into photo as a rob.
Or it's enough to remove the skins or the skin and immediately have a new look.
"Joy with that," he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following counsel: "To work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You could then start to contravene there," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what to do with what, why, while in the mode magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statements on mode deployers.
I know again, thanks to Ben's model photo that the styleist must have much more habitual variant than those that are photographed.
It is to say that for fashion story that has a ten pages (of a decade of models) I must be prepared to "retail" at least a quince.
Also, a clothing and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We need to take into account this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style are sometimes the half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
It's enough to look at Madonna, which is not a super cloud, but its image and marketing made it a world star.
In Czech, the approach to the use of the Stylist Services remains still fresh.
And the acquaintances sometimes considered them unnecessary (which is enough to know something but what I looked at the second rang).
And if someone makes himself a styling of our side, we should then take into account the fact that he says with a great probability a completely different size (ther smaller) than what he actually has.
We still have to navigate on the google and ensure if the bolevard information makes the event of the questionnaire celebration, if it has maigre or big, etc....
Honza and Mario put us Sunday on the heart that he does not enough to stand up in the mode and know assembling models.
It must communicate with the people he has, and it is so important to be a good psychologist.
If you have become people, don't flee, keep his opinion.
"When a manager asks you to strike his army and fill it with new elements, you can't throw everything and say to him, My God what horrible."
"You will find some things that you will find pleasant and that you will advise with what to bring them," said Mario.
That has shown us concretely what should contain everything that the "placovka" or "stylist" is called.
That's the one you're growing around the size and you're on yourself for everything you need.
Besides the clearly defined things such as skins, depiling roubles or even even the food sleeves, it is also found from the nylon fil (which the stylist uses for photographing products such as skins, or heads), special clips with which you are shutting a clothes in the dust, if it's too large (the epingle or other type of agraph is not useful because they could be clothing) or a kitchen.
So we were not only people who listen, but who have tried something practically, they have taught us how to look like shoes correctly.
And during the photo session in the kitchen where the surface is equal, the seed could, at a fortiori outside.
And that's how we colled and collapsed.
We do not have the right to touch the skins so that we do not hurt by inadvertence.
There is, therefore, a real need for skills.
Mario made me happy when he welcomed me for my creation.
The account I've made isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of course
I begin to understand more about doing styling a professional isn't a walk in a rose garden, that everyone tells what he wants.
The need for speed The Run is discussed throughout America.
Revision
In the origin of an unfair course is transformed because of a set of stupid errors of persons who have nothing to do in a matin movement to work.
This is up to a certain measure the ambition of each one, but it does not serve to anything if no one wants to do anything more.
The new subtitle The Run produced great expectations before his outcome.
He promised to take a new direction with the Need for Speed series already old and out of a type of game from playable parties that would not only be counted with points.
So we were curious how to be the pleased passages during which the main hero sorts of his car and did what he lived.
As this is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different than what was expected.
It's potentially arcade course games but the whole shooting shoot into the low because of some unnecessary errors that have already existed for several years.
It's not really errors, but instead the expression of an incomprehensible fainence from the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are taken in the adventure with the main hero Jack has characteristic problems and to resolve them to participate in illegal courses through America.
You sit behind the flight on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
Itinerary is divided in ten steps and then in more than 50 courses.
This results that each course is done on another item and steps planned in different environments that are sufficiently different from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling one moment that the game offers something identical to him.
Some environments are pretty nice even if the graphic level is the same type as the previous series.
Finally, it's not the end of the world.
But the driving through the desert, in automne landscapes or in high-ranged mountains is very pleasant.
The tests are in more time allowed by a typical element.
For example, in the desert you find in a swimming swimming tempte that reduces visibility in a sensible way.
Then, in the mountains, you must take attention to the fact that a alanche does not fall above you.
On the side of this, the different courses are well organised by each other.
There's only a small number but it's enough.
There are moments to overcome the number of adverse (such as in a classical course) then you will run against the clock (the classic with the chronometer) and then wait for another duel with an opposite.
Sometimes you also have the police that enters the game and try to make you the difficult situation.
The newness is the passengers outside the vehicle.
This is an interactive animation when most of the time Jack shoots before someone and you must help him by seeing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What's surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type you're expecting (for being real there's only three).
This result is well as because this element does not risk gender and place, in the context described above, in elements that accept the game.
The conduct model is in the tradition of the previous games.
This means that there is no extraordinary thing today but it is not possible to say that it is negative.
For real simulation, you must go to see another.
But even though we can find better in concurrence the conduct model is very well with the type of course design.
So everything's okay.
The problems start to appear after a certain time.
With the difference in the conduct model, the collisions are not yet at the point.
We are not waiting for this game a complicated deformation and collision, but when you don't have, at a collision with any object, the less idea of how your car is conducted, it's therefore not completely good.
During the slaughtered overshoots, you're touching a few times slightly, but otherwise your car is part of swimming pools.
Or it's in midst.
Thanks to the restart system This is not really a problem but it really does you.
Restarting is made so that when you've dropped the figure or you've been out in the decort the game brings you at the last point on the entry.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you must start the game from the beginning.
So it's another tool, for the case something doesn't happen as it's necessary, and something about which you really can account.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and the solution must be found in remembering the piece of the questionnaire.
The big here of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For instance, there are some virgins that we need to pass in a certain way, unless this isn't happening.
Otherwise, you will meet a place given for "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute in retard.
What is angry is the situations when you're seeing easy the adverse between two cars coming in inverse sense and when you arrive, you need to put on the side and switch them or swallow them well.
It's equal if you go before him because it's "called" in such a way as for the given situation it always arrives near your neck.
The opposites still have other advantages.
During all the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without worry about time, and you have always the same opposite that you are before at the same place.
This exercises the most final game when you run on a long bridge inverse sense.
The opposite must pass at any price before you.
When it passes before you, it hides the view of the other vehicles inversely and enters you in collision a lot of times.
You can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivant and full of adredaline, but it's clear that you're shocking quickly.
And it's harmful because through a simple conduct model the game is interesting and the places with so many action you don't have time to follow everything happens.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique items, that the course order is like there's no chance to cut off or something else.
The original idea is the changing of cars during the courses.
You need to take care of the essence pumps on the shopping because you can change it in the car, however, most of the time you have enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sport cars are ideal for the towns, the large American cylinders for the right authors and the super sport cars to exotic automobiles on very technical drives, for example on the mountains' roads.
And the challenge mode, which are courses in particular places you know about adventure, is very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you reached the highest driver level, different objects start to dislock:
This is online connected with the Autolog function, which, among others, compares your results obtained with the other players and offers other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult cuts to understand is the situation of the last course of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the metro tunnel (that is like) where you run in the darkness on the roads (that is like).
Your speed indicator indicates you between 150 and 200 km/h (oriented) and behind you is a metro line that sends you the car directly to the helmet.
At the editing we had a debate for a few days to know if someone really reflected in the creation of this game or even if the authors really take us for wicked ones.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasing and in some cases really super.
What is generous is that in extreme situations, the image does not hold the level and in some cases tragicly.
This applies especially to accidents with a large number of participants when a fluid image does not serve you anymore.
The sound part is good and the track is in the selection.
In order to enjoy the greatest number and especially the youngest public, a new sound track was created in the style "I melange everything," but we can wait for that no one will buy the game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: So the Run is really confused.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes, we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in the past few years.
But this game gives the impression of not being done.
The amusement is really good but prepare you to what the faults shoot you in the eyes with the strength of a aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassadrice near the European Union:
Czechs are as negative and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically deleted the balance between institutions"
"I didn't wait for a so hard war."
"This will take 5,6 years before the situation is calm and all players have a new role", so Milena Vicenova began its exposure to the Czech Ambassador near the European Union.
When it has succeeded to describe the various EU bodies and their relationships so comprehensible and visible, as a large number of conferences from the University of Justice Charles could turn it into it, she showed how it took its word "comprehensible and openly on Europe" very seriously.
Madam Vicenova has been honoured to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"When the beginning, the criticists he was facing, that it's a round, that he can't fill any mission and I have to say he cut the souffle to all the people because he plays his role in perfection."
"He is a man who knows listening to 27 Member States, while communicating with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and the Defence Policy in the context of a response to the question: "Who is the European Union?" "What phone number I have to call?", therefore, as an important step towards the university and a greater flexibility of EU policy towards states, like China or India.
Nobody wants to prohibit our syrecky (coat sweet smell that feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also stated the agenda he lived, lived and lives near the European Council.
She qualified the Czech Presidency two years ago.
Czech Republic has resolved the amount of financial crisis, gas crisis or well organized a Summit for a Eastern Partnership.
She qualificated the loss of a very negative governance and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation to the EU is now very busy.
According to the words of Madam's Ambassador, "the activity struggled its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved yet now.
The new Northern Union budget must be adopted, which becomes very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As the budget seems to be mixed and in terms of economies, which priority will be given, at least those countries will be helped to be resolved in the framework of future negotiations.
Madam Ambassadrice recalled his slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a comprehensible Europe."
"I really don't like abreviations, foreign words, the gardens that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that no one does round or tortuous corners in Brussels, bananas are differently large or no one has forbidden us to do syrecky."
It wants to better use the EU environment and see more Czech in European institutions.
A Europe to several speeds is waiting for us
According to the Ambassaded, the Czech Republic has the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who do not see things just in their negative aspect than positively.
It is also regrettable to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The mistake results, according to it, of several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their incapacity to write a motivation letter and a low support of the Czech part.
In addition to a Czech presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Cree me, when you come to me, the Poland, the Magyar, the Slovakia, this Frenchist said, "Hey, what are you doing there, that you still do this group of Visegrad?" and it is not all content."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in a future nearby there are new hard rules on budgetary policy which are expected by Member States.
This is the concept of a Europe to two speeds, if it's several speeds, which prevails instead of a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and other out of the area."
"We have the Schengen space, we also have the strengthened cooperation institution."
First of all, he was said that they cooperate among them the countries who want him and those who do not want him remain in their circle."
"There's a lot of institutions of this type and there's a really two-speed Europe," said Mrs. Vicenova.
It also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basiss that all the topics with EU impact should be discussed between all Members of the EU and not only the members of the eurozone.
History of a mark:
IBM innovator starts the second century of its existence
If someone had to search for the vocabulary that is most close to the IBM Strategy, the nearest would be "the long term".
For a large public IBM is the symbol of technological revolution, it is a strong resentment as very current, but since his creation has been a hundred years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was drawn by the first chief of the firm, the Visual Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He left this slogan that a large number of world problems can be resolved so that people want to think.
His slogan "PENSE" has become the press around which life will be developed (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to editing in 1935).
This was the basis of the culture of the health company developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thinking of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM survived hundred years because it remained still faithful to its basic values, and it was not afraid to change all the other around it.
This has allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century, we will reach further" was extended for the anniversary, the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well prepared system
Watson, in the thirty-first years, began to take care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - the only IBM people were the first employees to have the vacation paid, an insurance paid by the employee more a elegant employee uniform and a well-developed reward system for inventors and commercials.
Similarly, IBM has a relationship system with the well developed customer.
The society was generous in the discovery of talents - as one of the first firms to abolish any form of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy because it will be a woman- Virginia Romatty, which should replace Palmisano to the head of IBM.
This works at IBM for 30 years and is currently employed by Head of the Ventes, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM does what is called hamy, online brain-storming, from which many future strategies and innovations are made.
It is not surprising that there are many ideas - in the firm there are about 500000 people working.
A institution with a good name
This is the internal and external image of the company which ensures a safe position in business areas.
"When the IBM's beginning had an institution instead of a strong technological concept", said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Economy Professor at the Harvard Economic School and author of the IBM book.
"IBM is not a strong technological but a strong, helping to solve business world problems using its technology," added Geogre Colony from the strong Consulting Forrester Research.
As it said, there is a difference in entering the market and establishing this market.
IBM - or the "Blue Grenade", as it is familyly called in the United States with respect to its slogan - in hundreds of years, has grown up to become one of the world's largest strongest firms.
Of course, it is the strongest polyvalent technological - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, accommodation, services of the server to nanotechnology.
It has many patents from all the American technological firms and five of its employees received a Nobel price.
For example, the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the disc.
This year, IBM was recovered with $220 billion, the second strongest technological, according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it was the first time that exceeded in 1996 Microsoft.
Preview in advance
These are not all innovations and manufactures that have prefered customers and time - for example IBM did not have the same effect on a own OS/2 operational system, online service Prodiged or well from the IBM PCjr computer:
"After your business is built on the advanced move, you can't emotively remain increasing in the past," notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work.
For example, the Microsoft Conqueror that holds on the base and remains under the Windows operational system.
A technological perspective
In IBM income, services, which are formed for a fifth by software and hardwares, have a preferential place.
However, in 1990 she was with the most strongest hardware participation motivation.
Since the year 2000, IBM sold low income for $15 billion, it invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues in investments and even since 2008, when the new financial crisis was overlooked for the first time.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of his first Chief Thomas J. Watson, which also increased its volume of investment during the great economic crisis.
Is it now apparent that IBM passed the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM action was projected from 2008 to fusion of 120 per cent, and the net benefit of the steady continues to grow.
The logo of strong IBM is to change but not its values.
This can be expected that this flexibility matrix of other crises.
IBM history: From shoes to flights in the cosmos.
IBM company (International Business Machines) was born 100 years ago in New York; she had initially the complex name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She was named IBM in 1924 - first of all it was a mark used by a firm succursale in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the fusion of four solids whose history is linked to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as old "points", the pendules that registered the arrival and the department of employees.
The new company's architect was Charles Ranlett Flint who had presidened the Society's Surveillance Council until 1930.
Flint built the chief of a strong competitor Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then made the shadow to the founder of the firm - it's about Watson's ideas that up to now the identity and culture of society.
Watson's leading to the steadfast in 1952.
IBM, as he says, starts with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - the tranches of skin and meat until the registered castles.
Over the first four years in which Watson was directed, the business rate was multiplied until up to $9 million and started the firm expansion in all parts of the world.
Watson was for the firm so unreplaceable that after 40 years of direction is his son who cares for the director's fault, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its IBM direction, the development of artificial intelligence begins and develops the first programing language.
In the 1960s, people and computers helped NASA to guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercure, Saturn and in 1969.
Among time in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family - IBM System/360.
The classical PC that determines the time computer standard with the name of IBM 5150 arrives on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sells his manufacture of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, but purchases the Pricewaterhouse Coopers company and began to take care of advice and services with a high value added.
The strategy that has succeeded in IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a more intelligent planet".
Its objective is the intelligent illusion of technology in non-operated areas, such as transport and urban management.
For the field of IBM trade, a "Smarter Commerce" platform has been developed just a few years ago which helps trade managers in the whole commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong story also on our territory.
She created her succursale in Czechoslovakia in 1932 then the first central and Eastern European country.
Today, more than IBM RT, there is also the Brano's strategic outsourcing outsourcing centre.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and there is also the world's research and development team that concerns the recognition of the words.
Rychtarova about his unfaithful husband:
If you can keep this ring, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said, it's finished!
After his husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years of age) became a body guard and loved by Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina would still hope that Joseph wake up his red dream and return to his home.
Only she could not wait and has established clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can return home, but not as my partner" explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova was asylum in Bartosova in her house, she did not have to have her couple.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted to move from Ricany, Pepa did not restore the song.
And he announced in public that he loved him.
With the time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's connection and finished by telling him adède forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who his husband is sweet.
If Rychtar and Bartosova are separated there's no wife to welcome it on the step of the house's door.
"It's my son's biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put it out."
"He's no longer my old ancestor loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," left Rychtarova filtering by showing that she was dismissed from her husband but they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him isn't a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and not change."
"My wife set a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The society continues, I care for repairs, garden, immobilier, I buy."
"Avec Darina is on a completely normal discussion but we do not cook together" said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't prevent it.
"We do not cook together and he doesn't interest me to know where she gos, with who and if she has a connection.
I know that it's my fault, I got lovely of Iveta, and I take the whole responsibility on me," said Joseph.
The worst vices of women: Is that also related to you?
If you ask men to determine the typical visa of women, all of them, like the other, are able to get out of their "many."
My ladies, you're going to know in the following lines of women's vineyards that come to pump the blood of men's veins.
Budgets
Your half makes you comments that you are depending on the purchase?
Do you have to buy you at least a week?
Are you pleased to buy and packages at the time of money?
In your case you can talk to buys like a vice.
Some women think they should limit their patience to purchase.
But you will say, who would stay in the kitchen of clothing shops, to search for yourself sweet clothes and then try them all in chain (the ideal of different colours)?
And even though most of the women buying is a hobby, this may become a real hell for man.
Remember how many times you have told your friend that he's waiting for the entry...
Insatisfaction constant
"I'm not too big?"
"I would have to swim up at least 5 kilos - I should start to do sport?"
"I'm sorry?"
Do you not remember these phrases?
Yeah?
So you are part of these women who are obtained by their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are allergic because their partners are always in a complaint of their appearance.
The strong sex is not to say that more the frequencies of these complaints are increased and the more women become empressive.
Own and ownness at the first place
It's like an infinite manage.
Lay the windows, pass the aspirator, clean the ground, make the powder, cover the bathroom - and that's two times a week.
You make comments to your partner that he walks with salt feet on the clean ground, to children they have out of the lavabo, stored the face of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
If you are just suffering from this obsession, try to have the mind that nothing is needed to exage and that order and self-relatedness must not be at the first place in the family.
However, this unforeseen desire of selfishness may defeat your relationships and even the family peace.
The work of the skin
"But this survival used to the powder."
"Do you want to put these old chaussettes tomorrow?"
"A smooth service has nothing to do on earth."
If you do this work on your partner in this way several times a day, you'll really decompose it.
It is obviously that you don't think about badly you want to be impeccable.
Maybe if the men knew it, the women wouldn't have to do so much sake...
Disamination, vision
The disaster, the persistration, but also the insults against someone are also the own of certain women.
Women are particularly involved in relationships and are so pleased to treat subjects such as who, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us let a little unforeseen persistent vision out here and there.
The heart hand is, however, a particularity of women.
But the worst is those who advise, persiffer, even missing others and are for their endurance - especially to work in a collective of women - especially dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped their participation in the Victory of Philadelphia
The hokeyist Jagr participated two times in Philadelphia's victory during the Monday NHL match on Caroline's glass and is again heading of the productive Czech players for the competition.
From the view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who still made a pass and was appointed the best player of the match, he marked in the two cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also registered two goals during the match.
After the match, Jagr declared to other Atlantic journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the match he would give his ha-trick."
"I heard it."
"Any time this feeling falls above you" explained Jagr after his Giroux action marked a goal of the first thieve of the Flyers.
One minute later, there was a second shooting of the Czech team.
Voracek struggled behind the Hurricane's goals for the palette and presented it to the buyer Maxime Talbot.
One second before the first break, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a decent, but the beginning of the second party belongs to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he marked three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player of the link but he really is part of the three best," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd like to play carry with a hokeyjist like him."
"I'm really happy of this."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years in the NHL other team players have tried to play on me, now it's my tour," added Jagr.
Caroline made a dragon of this match because with a purpose of Tum Ruutu and again Dwyer on a punishment strike it ended with a different goal.
Matt Read did not lose other complications that ended to two against one.
"Pronger has performed excellent attacks in our area."
"He put on the palette, I took the speed and (Read) went to the most remote round of the castle.
"I tried to strike it and I came there," describes the last goal of his view of Voracek.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory head of the East Conference.
The Czech Defenseer of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not end the match with Buffalo in second-third because of a wound in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not face an experiencing defender their advances in two butts lost after a punishment strike by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
That's the fact that the back line was sick, which particularly embarked the local employer instead of lost pounds because they played the match with only 5 defenders.
"It's zero."
"We played the game only with an experimental player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, that's how," said Jacque Martin.
"Replace on replacement is not enough and we couldn't resist."
"We were just trying to simplify the game, push the palette outside our area."
For this, we had limits " added one of P. K. Subban defenders.
Ondrej Pavelect, Czech Defenseer, took part in Winnipeg's thirty-first attack and the winner on Tampou Bay.
5 different drivers participated in uax targets of the Jets, which arrested a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have been developed since 1989
Until 1989, Czechoslovakia was only 5 state travel agencies: Cedok, Sportrist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
The travel agencies at this time proposed travels, especially in the countries of the socialist block, because the travels in the west were very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for the holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (the two in Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period (1962-72), when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then the regime began to have an inclination for the West and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited to the Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist block (as for the Czechoslovacs) to travel individually in the framework of socialist countries.
In the case of the Czechoslovakia citizens wanted to travel individually in Poland or in the Soviet Union, a letter of invitation was not allowed to travel.
However, traveling agencies were also offering travels to Western, with a swimming shop or have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that, it was not yet winned.
The agreement for the debts that were the condition for traveling to the West was rejected to people "politically incorrect" who couldn't travel anywhere.
However, the Czechoslovac currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the western currency agreement to travel to the western.
The Czechs were most often passing their holidays in the country where there were many camping houses and chalets that the Czechs were purchasing, and this habit was hard until now.
The travels of the Czechs have been known since 1989 a great revolution.
Although the holidays in Eastern Germany and Bulgaria were up to 1989, the Czechs last year went to foreign for 4 million days in the world.
The great paradox that we do not know today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to move freely until 1989 because part of the Yugoslavia was now.
The elimination of visa in the last 90th century in the western neighbouring countries has caused a huge short-term visit, especially in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovacs couldn't travel for a long time to the west that everyone wanted to see at least one moment.
For example, travel organizations in Paris sleeped the Czechs in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical trail of a Czech travel was at this time to import with himself his own food conservated, saucisson, etc. to economize.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech Korea, which allowed our tourists finally after decades of years of freely purchase of the Western currency.
Our life level as well as the average wage has increased what has caused around 1997 another important moment.
Through a growing request for traveling agencys, since 1997, it began to prepare tours with aircraft connections that formically reduced costs in terms of the previous time.
At the end of the last 1990s, the Czechs had unvisual links with almost most of the world's developed countries that later facilitated our journeys.
Another interesting moment in the history of the post-revolution tour, when the first air charter was prepared towards a exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as each year the direct air charters take the Czech tourists into the warm countries; this winter will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It is more than 100000 Czechs that visit the exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development has occurred in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU removed the visa for the Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully expand in the group of developed countries.
In 2008, more than half of their holidays in the country (50.3%) had also been held in the history for the first time, and for the first time more than 15.000 corones were expendied by person for for foreign holidays, including attachments.
The General Assembly must find its Chairman, but this may be done by a situation without a solution "a patent"
About 5 months ago, the Czech football is without the President and it is risking that Ivan Hasek's successor to the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a General Assembly that has to take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, it is not always agreed with that vote regulation.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to begin to vote for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pella and Tomas Paclik are interested in the Czech football direction.
Hasek gave his demission in June, and during his departure he called his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that will lead to football in the future.
Only during the year after Hasek the football was returned back to divergences between the Association rooms that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely shown on 16 September when a new President had to choose.
The delegations of the General Assembly were unnecessary to the National House in Prague because the negotiations remained blocked and did not even have a question to deal with how to elect.
There was no agreement on the fact that who has the right to vote to the General Assembly - only, like, the statutory representatives or also the full power officials.
There was a partial agreement since this moment with the support of the Office for State and Law, as the representative of the full power is not possible.
Differences are still on the election regulation.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, planned or extraordinary negotiations, did not bring anything to the situation.
The opinions on the possibility of vote have changed several times, but the Nebralgic point remains still the same.
The question is: how to process for the third tour to not fall into the patent.
"The discours of residence in the following fact: or proceed according to the statutes or find another model," was one of the three Vice-Presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Dusan Svoboda, who represents the professional football in the association.
According to the model rules, the third tour of the candidates who have received the most powerful vote within the room for which it is candidate.
Morabia is ready according to what it is said to be retired so that the candidate will win the largest percentage of the two rooms.
And the Czech party examines the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentage of the voice.
"All this would then lose the idea of two previous tours, and that would be fully rejected the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, which includes objections of the Morrow party, and believes that the best would not change the regulation and vote according to the existing statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also agreed if he believes that the election regulation established under the statutes benefits most of all candidates.
"I would like to vote at the maximum according to the association statuss."
"For there are no ideas of saugrenus imagined by a representative as during the past General Assemblys," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is the first candidate for his exhibitions, particularly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, there will be a new President in Nymbuk, and he believes the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive way.
"The possible qualification today in the Championship of Europe should calm everybody."
"The football will again be on a happiness vague and there's more to join for cooperation" adds the officer of Jablonec, which between the three and the largest experience of football direction as well as at the regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimist.
"I believe in this agreement but, unfortunately, the situation is very tendencious."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are tendencies to want to change the designing regulations."
"This can again cause a blocking to the General Assembly."
"I hope as much as the sacred reason will win," said Rajchl.
It is not a lot of time for a common agreement to all parties.
Some meetings should have been held directly in Montenegro but that can say if the whole football direction will be complete for the match.
The specially painted flight to Podgorice, among other Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, had not been decolled for technical reasons and was searched for a variant to bring part of the Executive Committee on Receptions.
At the end is the Ministerial Meeting, which could be held afternoon, which should be determined.
The Ministry of Youth Education and Sport Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive the most strongly sportive association of the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state donation, the credibility of football, and also the General Assembly of the Czech Union of Sports, which must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the presidency position because he does not see any right candidate.
If the Head of Footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would respond to all that he requested for a new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) would not be put in campaign for this high function.
"If such a candidate exists, I fight for him and do not present me to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik stated to the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to enter into competition with Miroslav Pella and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pella to access the AFRT's head, which preferably would be given favor for this election.
Paclik also stressed that in the case of the elections he would hold this post by the President until 2013 for a General Assembly.
It would be well in the function a experimental and high-level manager but that is not associated with the football world.
"I've discussed with people who had the profile," he said.
"For me it was horrible when some told me that they didn't want to be identified with the Czech football at this time."
"I would like to change this image," he added.
What is said, especially Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the regional football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man who is known in the counterparts as a lobbyist who can influence the vote of delegates in the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable that Pelta takes this position to the President.
"If he wins, the current state would remain and there would be nothing again in the football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high flight trader, it would be even less favorable to football," said Paclik.
What is still the fact that the name of Pelta has been announced a few years ago in the course of listening under an investigation on a corruption case, for which Pelta has gone without any punishment.
"I don't know what prestigious Pella would bring to football."
"And how we would be considered at the eye of the EUFA and the FIFA," said Paclik, who said a while ago, "if Pella becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen."
In the case of Paclik triumphing on Thursday, it should prove that he could cooperate with Ferta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly of September, who had completed a fascination, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go."
"He has great capacity."
"It would be able, for example, to be presented as a leader of the representation."
"But as the Association Manager he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put the nest in what I don't know," says Paclik, who took a great attention in September when he announced for the cancellation of the arbitration Commission with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims it would be at the level to direct the Association.
He, as example, takes his ability to direct private firms and also direct the club of Plzen since last year, who celebrated with his support in May in his first division.
"I have the strength to make something changed in the sport world and to bring it a certain culture."
"I would strive the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Commission, which leads to situations of bad guest," added Paclik, who does not chaste his antipathy to the Head of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonisation of relationships with the Czech Olympic Olympic Committee which would enable the lobby power at high-level policy to obtain more money than game taxes.
"It's one of the key points that the new President should take care of."
"If it is the tax on hair games as the political parties declare, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money goes", he stated.
Paclik does not take its current connection with the Plzen club as something negative even if he himself states that the President of AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pella is again connected to Jablonec and Rajchl with Ducla de Prague.
"It's not the ideal."
I don't see why I translated my actions from the Plzen club to someone if I have to return a half years later," Paclik said.
Pelta promised new statuss for AFRT that should end up the patent situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates to the President of Miroslav Pella promised that, if chosen, the AFRT will have new statutes that should be finished in the future with regard to the election regulation.
The official of Jablonec is very optimistic in Nymburk before the Thursday meeting and thinks that the success of the football representation should calm this helmet before the vote.
Pelta before the election of September which has not been carried out just as to the national representation and to obtain financial resources if it is elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last time before the last two months before the General Assembly, and this delay of two months could well enable him to defend his vision of the football direction and to present it in a wide context.
"The people at all levels have been from football for a long time and waiting for the Thursday there is a President."
"They feel that it is the best time for someone to take the direction of the Association," he adds, but it is mostly associated with the Jablonec club, has worked a lot of years in Sparta and the EU Executive Committee.
This is also for that he has enough experiences to guide the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election there was an euphory that was dominated at Ivan Hasek at the time.
"Offortunately, the June General Assembly of Statutes were approved which were not perfect as all have been seen."
"If no all these different states were interpreted, we would have already had a president since September," Souligne Pelta.
It is just the revising of the most important document of the civil association that has taken all the attention to delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I'm ready to take all the responsibilities in the case that it does not go."
"This is a principle without which we can't exist", added Pelta.
Then he tried, said, to do not face his opposers.
He previously stated that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he had recognized his legal training and that he knew that his candidate advisor would be his first Vice-President.
He hasn't been attacked for a long time from the Tonas Paclik that, on the other hand, does not stop criticing Pella.
"He evolves in the football for a year and has already got some success."
"But his attacks were not more honorable and surprised by many people during the campaign."
"It is also why some now have doubts about his character," said Pelta to the address of his adversary but still, he said, faithful to the proclamations he had done in September.
His strongest weapons are according to her knowledge of football competitions from the lowest level to the national representation.
It should be a football vitrine.
"And I would also try to finish all the matters that start with the Bohemians or the follow-up of corruption scandale."
"I would immediately enter negotiations with the public and private sector so that we could get enough money for all the football," said to the CTK Press Agency two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the football head would not bring any change in people.
"I should know with all employees," he stated in Strahov where it dominates a comprehensive nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophical scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not be in Nymburk for nothing.
"If there's only one point of discussion about how to vote on the third tour we're going to overcome it."
"The football needs credibility, and it will only be obtained when a new leader will be on his head," as Pelta says in optimistic way two days before the probably determinant day for his officer career.
Rajchl promises that AFRT will start working hard under his direction
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected to the President of the Football Association of the Republic of Czech to the General Assembly on Thursday, this would not like a large number of people.
Rajchl, however, promises that in the case where it would be chosen, we will start working hard.
He wants systematic changes and make members of the Executive Committee are responsible for the various fields of football.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians case, improve the relationship with the EUFA and the FIFA, bring more money to the football and continue the work started by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"Come President, I want to take care of football in his whole."
"International contacts with the EUFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a football for youth."
"But I don't say I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in a CTK-conduct.
"I'm a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each members take care of a determined area."
"And I will distribute hard missions so that the football is a big step forward."
"Booccoup of people will not be pleased because it will start working hard instead of criticing others," he added.
He said, he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
" About me, we know I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it's the shooting and if I have people behind me, who will put me cups into the wheels and spend doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he was hesiting.
"There's a lot of people say I don't have to turn away because they're going to stop too."
"It's a trust that I can't betray," he says.
What is reasonable is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"After these two years, I don't want to leave it."
"They have been launched processes that will have consequences in a few years and I would not want anyone to stop them." He said with fear that only in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election the situation in the Union would not come back as she was before Hasset.
"I believe in a systemic work and it's something that Mirec Pella can't do."
"There are people who would do football so that it would only be for those who have been selected."
"We can reprove me a number of things, but surely not to support anybody."
"I'm trying to be a goal."
"I want to do football for everyone because everyone will be satisfied not only those who have been selected
He reaffirms that it's only a President for Czech.
"And if there are those who say the contrary, I'm ready to make the maximum for Morbian."
"For example, it is the time to consider that the second division will be divided in both parts of the Czech and the other wheel whose winners would be first division."
"The problem is now to find young players is not the same as today with only three living teams in the division.
As Thomas Paclik, President of the Plzen Club, has entered the competition for the president's position, Rajchl cannot evaluate his own chances to win.
"I still feel a support from the Czech Room that has chosen me its Vice-President and knows that there will be success with me," said Rajchl, who considers among his future success to economize tens of millions of corones on unsuccessful contracts, television negotiations and game law.
He said, on the contrary, that the fact that the Association is not unilateral is a common fault to all.
While he said about Pella "It's been disqualificated because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility", he believes that the second opposite Paclik is a strong candidate that has offered to football.
"Personn can't doubt Plzen that he has done a super work this year."
"If he was elected, he would certainly continue in what has been started by Hasek and would not make a significant change among people in the Commission."
"He wouldn't want to smell his success," said Rajchl who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
A blue snake
The Julia Stanek
Ovni Ovni, wonderful pools of Budapest: Traveling through Europe can live its blue miracle - and after turning the city or making a long walk, you can leave his feet in gas water baths.
A book shows what nation basin can be experienced as well as well.
When Iris Meder traveled in the past 18 months, there was an object that should not miss in his bathrooms: his bathroom.
When she was swimming on his skin in the water, she observed the artificially arranged shoes, and sloped against the putten marbles that were waiting for him on the other side of the pool and lacked to smile the Art New Methically restored from these converted pools.
If a coated pool was pleased with him, she noted in its book without time all the decent interest details on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 pools were examined in this way by the architecture Meder's historical architecture, and she presented them in its book already published: "Badefreuden (Badefreuden du Bain). The municipal pools of Munich, the historical bathrooms in the black forest, "Beton Hardcore" in the Taunias.
She has conducted its "excepted bathrooms in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Near Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locals in Italy, France, Czech, Slovenia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
Allmand of 46 years is a real fertility of the bath culture.
Meder, explains that it does not have a lot of interest in sport but it feels attractive to the water in a completely different way.
It is unreasonable that nation supporters should be satisfied to observe blue carreals and to meet from the Javel's water bridge while players swear with epipea forests or can listen to the pleasant bird gas of the park.
"I asked me a day why the swimming pools have to be always so laid," said the Vienna.
"I then started a collection of beautiful baths."
The water surface double-building architecture
A swimming in a pool and volatile sauna oils - well-being factor in nation rooms are huge because all senses are shocked, according to Meder.
And if the buildings would be given a little more punishment, the narrow salts could be a real delight for the eyes: "On the place of a floor we have a water surface in the nation halls."
"He's on a transparent side, but reflects from the other side the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optimized in a double way: high shoes, multicolor carreaux, tremplins.
The volume of small "Badefreuden" image makes a generous report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - he certainly wants to make a sweet in the blue.
The collectioner Meder has found notable examples during his research in Hungary.
Besides the wonderful well-being baths like the Szechenyi bathroom of 100 years old in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the castle (walker bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a heat bath with water filled with alcali and (Városi Termaládöö in Yaszbereny) and found in a bottle building.
On the contrary, the swimming pools in full air of Switzerland and Austria offers spectacular views. While a toilet of Zürich's bathroom has the whole city in his eyes, you can admire Arlberg shocked from a outdoor pool from St. Anton: the Turk bath is muned with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski piste.
Maybe the most extraordinary swimming pool design is waiting for swimming pools in Langenfeld: The East Water Dome looks like an OVNI that came to shoot on the Alpes.
In winter, there are three open plates, while in the back-plane the mountains of the Ocean to the heavens.
Alhambra in the black forest
Javel's water smell does not depend on all the swimming pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths have an odeur of soufre, of the arpád-spa in the Bekescsaba Hungary is a strong oil odor, which is difficult to believe, in a healthy space.
The odor produces therapeutic alcalinic water containing carbon hydrogen, which is almost black and its limon skins you skin as you leave in the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for the beautiful pools, Iris Meder also was discovery: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free and full air pool from the Czechoslovakia, she found her in front of a barricad terrain.
The bathroom designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed.
By shooting an eye by the window of the building-Art New in red-blank-yeune, she observed the expansion of bad herbs between the carreals.
She observed a contrary effect in a charming pool in the black forest: Bad Wildbad thermist palace.
This building has already survived three phases; it is possible to discover not only the neo-Roman elements that are out of its design in 1844 but also a sea room in the Alhambra style that has been added in 1900.
Since its 1995 careful modernization, the thermal palais remains the favorite bathroom of the pool expert, Iris Meder, and not only because she is originating Blackzwald.
"It's already a nice performance, but of the foundation of different construction styles in a so sharply unit," said Meder.
With such a palace, the plowed in the thermal pool is apparently only a small question.
Agricultural speculation
The German Bank examines details the sphere of the first materials
Christian Teevs
Does the German bank leave its speculation on the first materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann was responsible for researching the consequences of the speculation of the world's poor.
In January, the Chief of the Group then wants to take out consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: 84 per cent of the Germans are unacceptable that banks split on the first materials such as Maize and Ble.
Two thirds of the questioned persons even require that the German bank and other credit institutions decline this case because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
It is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumers' organization.
The study supports a report submitted by Foodwatch in Middle October.
The author Harald Schumann pointed out in this article that the Specification of the Bours on the First Global Materials, puts the prices towards the high and that the banks share a complexity with global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is practically linked to the Chief German-Bank, Josef Ackermann, although the large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
The speculation of the first material was initially introduced to protect goods against price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts share the view that the partners have been distracted from offers and requests - and benefit from the costs of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to the different criticism of the American competitions: He promises to invest reproachs and said, "No cases are worth playing the good reputation of the German Bank."
According to the information provided by SPIEGEL ONLINE, a international working group is currently reviewed by Foodwatch report accusities.
The examination must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the German Bank's administrative Board must be submitted – in general recommendation.
By the end of January, the Head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be shot.
It could result in a reduction in the market of first materials, or even a complete abandon.
Ackermann built his image
The Chief of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the new, but at the same time confirmed its critics towards the financial sector: "The speculation on the increase of foodstuff prices shows a special dramatic way, whereas the banks today weak to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be in particular under obligation today.
"The German Bank must remove all places from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculations," said Bode.
"It's a little importance, Mr. Ackermann, if it is questioned of disappointed people or if the German Bank's reputation is played."
The consciousness of Ackermann may first appear to be surprising, but it is clear that the group's GDP wants to present a perfect image, a few months before it leaves its functions.
The German Bank announced Monday that the President of the Administration Council will not change anything in what is planned within the Administration Council.
Ll could improve its brand image with a abandonment of agriculture speculations.
And about evental losses, he did not worry about it - his successor will care for it.
One over two would residue the placement on the first materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a strong pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30 000 international people have already participated in the organization campaign.
Bode published the Mardi survey, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 persons on 7 and 8 November.
Only 11% found this legally that the German Bank proposes placements for which food prices are made.
Many customers from the bank would also take personal consequences if they learned that their bank participating in such operations: one on two would residualize, after the investigation, all placements for which money is injected in the spheres of the first materials.
43 per cent would not consult such a bank to their turnover, 49 per cent responded that they would reflect on the resolving of their account to change banking institutions.
21th house in Vienna
The Pavillon who moved
D'Ingebor Wiensowski
An architecture history with high, down and a Happy End: the Austrian pavillon for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 has brought prices, was a museum in Vienna, and was left empty, and was cut into ruin.
Now it is again open and has an exhibition home.
If there is an enthusiasm for a modern post-fight architecture, for its clear forms, his hamburgers, their lived and audacious, and its new building materials that are typical of faith in the technical progress, then the snack of the Austrian Architecte Karl for the universal exposure of Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
Shoanzer's Pavillon receives the "Grand Price of Architecture" for its steel and seen, light and suspended construction.
The construction is considered until now as an important step in the modern architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavillon for the next universal exposure of Austria.
With its legendary BMW 4 cylinder house and its adjacent building in Munich, he was finally famous at international level in 1973.
His pavillon project was transformed as a temporary construction after universal exhibition in the Swedish garden at the south of Vienna, and a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was not physically or technically adapted to a museum - no walls to increase art works, so not a good environment.
However, it has been used so long, until the contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building was empty and was increasingly delayed.
At this time the architect Adolf Krischanitz transformed the Palillon, now he brings the name of "Maison of the 21th century" and will be used for the future as a museum for the contemporary art.
Thursday night the Belveder Museum opened, at which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a piece of chance at any point of view.
The new start was conducted well by Agnès Husslein-Arco, which has become the new direction in 2007 from the Austrian Belveder Galerie.
Husslein-Arco has promoted a historic art historic to a considerable career among others in his youth of artistic patrinistry, following Sotheby's museum, Guggenheim and as the founder of the modern art Museum, she has spent in particular the works of transformation among political men and monuments, and has obtained private and sponsoring funds and established the exploitation.
Except the contemporary art, the works of the Fritz Wotruba sculptor whose foundation has been exposed the same name, a coffee and a library are found there, and a office must be built.
strict supervisory, small budget
For the achievement of Crischanitz, it was the ideal interpretation.
Not only because he had transformed and extended with awareness the Joseph Olbracht's session and he had won the competition, but because he had studied Vienna's technical University and that the pavillon was "a very important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, who lost generosity and slightly after his movement in Vienna and its use change.
During the current transformation there were great problems: the building was "a gouffer in energy", says Crischanitz.
The window profiles of the green façades were changing, the isolant drink strengthened in green fibers were put and the table replaced by a particular safe drink.
The powders of the thermic bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and the full of friendly revestigations have been reliable.
Two sub-sols made place to the new exploitation, a smooth light panel between the house and the road ensures the lighting, a bridge leading to the entry - it is almost a new building, but always light Pavillon Schwanzer.
The outside doors of origin are left, the house is painted in a decent protection against the red-brun color routine.
And the cinema room is even exactly identical to what she was last time.
And all this is under close monitoring of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Some materials that were good and cherished should be found, and who also like the monumental protection office," said Crischanitz and attracts attention to a brown soil.
Despite all obstacles, problems and transformations, the building has remained slow and slow.
This would have been difficult with the Pavillon, "what came from Brussels," said Crischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such architecture is "forever on the bad place" and wants to desire all "wear good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21th century is not on the bad place, because if it is an opportunity for urban construction: around the Jardin Switzerland is just the "quarter of the central car" all newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And there may be another chance to happen: the house of the 21th century could benefit from strengthening another Crischanitz building, because the collectioner Francesca van Habsburg has purchased the Berlin temporary art center, and, as he says, it already negotiates with the city to obtain a site in the Jardin Suisse neighbourhood.
It plans a fixed winter crisis in millions.
The rail road company has developed a crisis plan which aims at avoiding winter accidents.
The number of employees should double.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter accidents and late delays, the Dutch Bahn company will expend more than 70 million additional train accidents this year.
The "Image" newspaper reported to the previous by calling an internal crisis plan to the group, that over 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should also allow better availability of vehicles and rail networks in the case of extreme integrities.
The number of internal and external employees for the deniving of rail plants and which should be doubled and passed to 16.000 people.
The objective is to cut out which from snow and ice to the beginning of the service phase and 90 per cent of the road devices necessary for the service within a period of 4 to 5 hours.
Two months ago, the Chairman of Garden Rüdiger Grube held the government and industry at a conference at the top of the accidents of the winter.
The last winter, the rail road company had a huge problem for the transport of users, because it misses among other reserves in difficult meteorological conditions.
This is how many new regional trains have been expected for years to be authorized by the Ministry of Railways.
Furthermore, there is a delay in the ICE train delivery.
The rail road company has been doing for years, since it has to be done to check the ICE train stations more frequently on the shopping, after a rupture of shoes had occurred on an ICE in the Central Garden in Colombia.
German "Germany Bank" bank pays millions of penalties to the United States.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann in the United States, the German Bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a s amendment to millions.
As the problems of the German Bank weren't already sufficient, the past of this sector's rattrape in addition to the US: the Francfort Institute pays for $145 million ($1,6 million), to resolve a difference due to the failure of five major co-operative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of hypothetic documents.
The NCU Financial Market Regulator is a number of accused banks, and is to encourage cooperative banks to make false promises on the purchase of financial products and would have minimised their risks.
These documents have perished a great value during the financial crisis and led to the banks down.
"We are satisfied, have found a solution to this matter, without the parties in a court procedure," said a German Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank has not recognised in comparison with any mistake.
This is also valid for the Citi-Gruppe, which entered into a payment of $20.5 million.
The President of CNUA Debbie Matz welcomed the consignments of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (National Credit Union Administration) responsible for the United States cooperative banks and is in case of failure to protect customer deposits.
The CNUA is trying to repair the damage of a number of billions of dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first in their genre.
The regulator also took other large banks in part and was assigned to the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As regards the question of hypothetical documents, it is "Morgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are on the base.
When the American real estate bowl grew in 2007, this has been fatal for a number of bank companys.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers grew up.
Even if the events have been held for a few years, at the current time it smells a tempest wind on the American banks.
Investorers and supervisory authorities have intended many means to obtain repair or sanctify missing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has started the largest complaints wage.
It reiterates 18 large international banks, the two financials of the American Employees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are in nature for hypothetic businesses of approximately 200 billion dollars.
The German Bank must also provide a remedie to the FHFA, which is several operations of a total of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurter responds to “substantial losses” but without quoting a specific amount.
The German Bank had rejected the applications as injustified and declared to defend.
WARREN Buffett increases 10 billion in IBM
Buffett, the financing governance, invests colossales in the IBM TI company.
Since March, he purchased actions for a value of more than ten billion dollars.
As far as the large American investor Warren Buffett explains, without stopping investing in IT computer companies, since long-term evolution of companies appears only in bad pronotics.
However, he read the MIB reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
It was already understood that IPM proposed services and computer systems for other IT sectors.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered as a chevalier attack in the financial world.
The TI IBM activity is therefore granted the right to call on "Mr. IBM".
Because Buffett today revealed to the CNBC economic emission that he has purchased IBM actions from a value of $10.7 billion since March.
His investing company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large IBM shared with a share of 5,5 per cent.
Buffett said that IBM never knew anything about this commitment until now.
He welcomed the direction, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
"You've done a super job," said Buffett strategially.
IBM has been placed for a few years on IT lucrative services as an operation of accounting centres.
Intelligence pioneers, who are over 100 years, also offers software and consultations as well as business calculators.
Buffett had until now avoided technology companies.
He says he's investing only in businesses that he understands.
But instead, Buffet is attacked instead of rail fresh, lubrifiant manufacturers or machines.
Her Holding Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 branches as well as parts of a series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former municipal back.
This 81-year-old age was repeated in the 1960s" the small business of Berkshire Hathaway and created it at one of the most prestigious world enterprises, through intelligent investments.
However, his life style is modest.
That's why he is a cult figure for many world investors.
His sense is almost unfaithful to win the money valued the name of "Omaha's Oracle".
After the Buffett investment advertising, the IBM actions increased by a percentage of buses.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, has a bourn value of more than 220 billion dollars and accounts with Apple and Microsoft among the most precious technology companies in the world.
In Microsoft, said Buffett, he doesn't want to participate in it.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell", the Turkeyn media doubt the German right status.
A even newspaper speaks of a "very ideology", which would now be born.
The murderers of eight Turkishs and a small Greek company in the 2000-2006 years had an extreme context.
Following this new, Turkey and the German-Turkey population react with fear and concern.
Because for many German-Turkeys the spectrum that the death has been decreed for a long time has appeared: since the fire attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there was no longer a comparable violence with this extreme right context against the Turkishs.
The fact that there was a xenophobia in Germany, it has never been questioned.
The extreme right-related network, however, reveals the proportions of which the size is far beyond predictable.
"It was a return to blood ideology," "This was the title of the internet parution of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" newspaper highlights, instead, that one of the authors had been a V man of the Constitution, and is concerned about the fact that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme-right bourbon.
It is reasonable to respond to the Turkish community in Germany: she called this weekend to a quiet reminder to the victims of racial violence before the door of Brandeburg.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies had thought about a fifty-first anniversary of the German-Turk recruitment agreement.
It is with gaies colors that the cohabitation was set in scene, symbolized by a history of success.
The reports of some Turkish media are the effect of a gifle: "the gift of Germany for the fifth anniversary" is the title of a article in the Turkish platform "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murderers.
So the German torment of the "Jurisdiction" is not free of striking there are unilateral conditions.
"It begins to pure," Tel is the title of the Ahmet Kulahci chronic.
It stressed that people would have been killed, would pay taxes and would have contributed to the reconstruction of Germany.
The police's action was very critical on the German-Turkey forums and had been discussed by the success of their research.
Why has no longer come to the mind of German authorities to investigate in some extremely right suspicion, the authors are surprised.
More than one has been prepared to at least dramatic means: "If the case continues to be burned, the migrants will remain nothing else than self-defence and weapons."
"It's gonna be the best self-defense."
"The internal peace in Germany depends strongly on the quality of information and relevance of the punishment of the whole network," wrote "Selen".
This means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of the ruins after Solingen fire is deeply accompanied in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has been clearly shown to the Turkishs living here more than there was a tangible threat, and the Germans, about which the infidelity and distance were possible through violence.
However, the attacks increased the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Repeat the errors of the past
Another time, it is the failure of German policy after the attacks of Turkey's press claimed: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Solingen' fire, he sent a condolence telegram to the Chief of the Turkish State, representing the funerals in Cologne by his Minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time in his speech, the number of taxes were produced by the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be evaluated on the amount of its tax charges.
The current report of Turkish media shows once again how many German-Turcs are deep towards the local right status since that date.
In addition to the efforts of more clarification and re-evaluation of the extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is that time necessary.
The Zürich Lake Scandale Bank
The most avventured Bank in Europe is not in Italy or in France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and slowly pained a crisis on the other hand.
It's a German who must lead now.
It's certainly not what Axel Weber was imagined.
After his spectacular department of the Federal Bank, it was known in July, that it would take almost a so-called post in 2013: the President of the Swedish Bank's Administration Council, a large step towards an unexpected and lucrative carriage.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, welcomed, Switzerland for his beauty and the UBS for his recent solidarity and has made awareness of the future colleagues.
"UBS succeeded in the Turnaround."
"I enjoyed the cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But since September, he was clear that everything would change.
A UBS Title market in London had displaced all the bank security systems and flamed around EUR 1.7 billion.
The Chief of the UBS Administration Board of Oswald Grübel, a well known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
from the Chairman of the UBS Administration Board is considered as suffering, and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally returning?
We have already learned that Weber can be consulted from the bank from February 2012.
And it will be re-employed by the Administration Presidency in May, not in 2013, as the Tuesday Bank has reported.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
It is not banking, much more professor of economy and bank President, and it would certainly have needed a time of adjustment.
On one occasion, he takes the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has come to prove again once again that it has been the title of "the largest scandale bank in Europe".
Indeed, the UBS is from a huge side - until recently, she was the largest manager of world assets, and on the other hand, she has been skandale for years on the other.
Nothing, it seems, doesn't get so proud of the Swedish bank.
This began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had a excellent reputation.
The image of Swiss's assets, silent and solid, but also Russians, was combined with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become a very large bank in the field of bank investment.
Thus, the UBS would work on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an academic customer than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had progressed as investment banks in the bond of the largest banks in the world.
That made it impression.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor in Zurich reported: "I've always taken the UBS as a model of good bank before my students."
"When the current optics are asked, how would I just have been able to mislead at this point?"
He was deeply wrong.
In 2007, it appeared that for the first time something did not turn around the U.S.U.A....
In the midst of the year, President Peter Wuffli took a surprising way, which was considered to be a high intellectual and a genital banker.
Some months later, we were pressing for the reasons he had gone.
The bank's division had flamed with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross on billions.
In order to spend this, the UBS announced a capital increase of an amount of 13 billion francs and made a cross above.
For this, she actually found investors, but that, just a few years ago, would have disrupted the sourcils: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was under silence, at the point that the name has never been learned.
It was only the first time.
In April 2008, this was impeded.
The bank had to announce again the losses counting to billions, the President of the Marcel Ospel Administrative Board, who was still in 2006, was the second Administrative Board of Switzerland.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the U.S.U.S. was, taking account of its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the failure, and it was saved by the State.
The National Bank has saved the UBS for decades of billions of challenges, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertable obligations in action, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
Everything Switzerland has been shocked - because it has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country to switch from such big banks.
Finally, the overall overall UBS 2007 balance was chosen by more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphic).
"We couldn't save UBS again," said the bank searcher, Geiger.
After the first disaster, it was followed by the second.
Over a few months ago, the U.S.S. had been captured because of a fiscal difference with America and was prepared to publish the data of the registered customer, which may have failed taxes with the Bank's assistance.
In addition, she accepted a payment of $780 million - in the reimbursement of unjustified benefits from these operations with a increased amendment.
Thus, the UBS had been more or less published that she had assisted tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the skandale, the Swedish bank secret was no longer the same.
It follows the retirement of the Head of the Administrative Board and the President of the Administration Board.
And about the exode of customer money.
Thus, in a few months the bank had lost his credibility in the two main business sectors: bank investment due to bad speculations and the management of assets due to tax fraud.
And as somewhere there was a return to calm, and as we thought, the UBS would get out of it, it was followed by this disastrous stories of titles: a single market of flambe title 1,7 billion euros, before the bank finds that something did not turn around.
And it's published: with investment bank risk management, it doesn't always seem to work.
"In the case of Adoboli, the risk management of too little changed risks,” said Martin Janssen, economic and financing professor at the Bank Institute of Zurich University.
So the financial director of a large German bank is certain: "The problem of the UBS is that it has no risk management."
However, it was precisely the idea of prudence, with which Swiss bankers had taken their function for a long time, that to become a guard of the great world's world's happiness: not too large risks, but money security, and the world could well be able to get out of the Alpine Republic.
Swiss banks' treasures were the symbol of an inebral fiability like Lindt and Sprmungli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS Central in Zurich will still paid with the private Swiss bank's click solid - it's just a little greater.
Later the situation is classic.
The Bank has its seat at the Zurich Central Garage, which leads directly from the Central Garage to the Zurich Lake, which itself is rounded by the Swiss mountain summits.
The buildings are prestigious here, shopshops are among the highest of Europe.
The doubles like Tiffany's, they are found here among the Swiss tradition shops as well as those of the Sprmungli Confessor.
Since centuries, Swiss bankers lived here: from the National Bank through the Switzerland's credit palace to the church private banks like Julius Barr.
We arrived in the UBS entrance hall by a large door.
In the inside, the walls are covered by marble, before they are faced with sweet shoes, and next to the bank's logo, a great label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer looks here: security.
This idea of the Swedish bank has one day or the other disappearance of the market - or traced the two large Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss Credit, as the Chief of a Swiss small private bank finds.
It would not prefer to read his name in the newspaper, as all Swiss bankers also do business with the two large banks.
The UBS would have become too large, especially in bank investment, where the Anglo-Sexons would be further breached.
The Swedishs wouldn't say anything anymore.
"And even when, they have been adapted to the wheels of the Anglo-Sexons."
This was in effect the Angle-Sexone Investment Bank that changed the UBS, making high benefits, and then deployed: no European financial institutions have lost so much money in the sub-prize jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This merry the government coalition of the small country to the seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," wrote the author Lukas Hassig in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With up to 68 billion francs around 45 billion euros, political men agreed to save the big bank.
How could it happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankingers, they see the problem especially to the UBS size.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks concluded a large group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for Switzerland, and recorded an increase without stop.
What helped it is that the two different predecessor banks from UBS have complemented: a rich bank, but in lethargy with stronger asset management in Zurich and a poorer but certainly more internationalized.
However, international investment banks were favorable to have a lot of money access, with which they could turn a large root.
Two names are associated with the UBS ascension: Peter Wuffli, Head of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, previously President of the Administration Board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said the bank searcher, Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the big modest intellectual, which is very well heard in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who slowed a road to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would be faithful until the end in Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," said Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance has arrived before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly recalls the leader meetings during which the head of the Wuffli Group has always expressed the same word: detroit Goldman Sachs.
The United States bank was the most powerful investment bank in the planet.
She commanded the "League Tables", which documented the success of the banks at this time.
After all the UBS wanted to get up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the case of estimates and transactions of mobile values, it played a very important role.
However, business advisers, who had the responsibility, highlighted a weakness: in international interest operations, in the Fixed Income bank garden, there would be a great difference in comparison with the largest banks.
UBS had lacunes at the level of American hypothecarbons.
To complexe this lacquer, the UBS launched in an avventure, which almost costs his life.
The bank is also the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the sub-American sub-princies placements that invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and made the value documents based on American hypothetical loans - but also maintained risks.
Even when other banks were looking for a long time to get down.
"And in the summer 2007, while the market of the American Immobilist was in flame, the UBS purchased there," said Geiger, banking experts.
More euphory is larger the shooting is brutal.
A manager after the other had to leave, when a term for temptations was more difficult than we thought.
Posts at UBS have become exempted and up to now banking.
Those who directs the large bank have almost impossible task.
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank searcher, Geiger, has already a idea: put an end to the investment bank, concentration in the management of goods, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't want to go too far.
But the investment bank must be strictly atrociated, as it is clear until now.
On Thursday, Sergio Ermotti bank chief wants to present the world its future strategy.
Italy, Swiss, was 51-year-old only intended to be a transitional title when the bank was separated with surprise from his predecessor Grübel.
Among the time, it was imposed: it must be sustainablely conducted by the UBS's affairs, communicated the Zurich Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to restore the investment bank to the Middle Ages in the 1990s.
It cancelles 3500 jobs.
But it's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
With what she wants to win the money?
These are the questions that "Axel Weber has certainly already been put.
He says publicly until now only that he'd be looking for a apartment with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.

Intelligent cornels are offered in cities
In many places, freshes are considered "a bird problem" but the experts claim that these very intelligent animals are not cutting cities for a long time.
Some loves, some others want to dismiss from them as soon as possible. The corners belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of the residents are multiplied because of the salt and the brush of animals.
An antidote against the " bird problem " is not yet viewed.
During the first ostfriestical symposium on the corners, experts said that it is no longer possible to cut the fresh of the cities.
The experts of all Germany discussed the possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in towns
Natural protectioners were based on the problems of the city also on the exode of specially protected fresh: the use of chemicals in agricultural products is increasingly destroyed by traditional lives.
The chasse, the installation and the typical covasion trees made a difficult life to birds.
The corners are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 covasion couples in the Western East, in the northwest of which Jever, Depholz and Ahim near Bremen and in Leer.
In 2005, a conflicted project had gained negative advertisements because of the massing of corners in the region.
The critics found the capture of birds in pigs and kill them with particularly brutal gourdins.
"The normal expulsion, evidence, does not serve anything," found the planner of the city and landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nids through the water under pressure or well shoot the trees, often produced unwanted consequences, said the Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Bade-Wurtmberg.
"The animals get away, the great colonies divide themselves and divide themselves in other places."
It's imaging only in exceptional cases as in hospitals, retrait houses or schools.
"We are obliged to live with them, we can't extermine them anymore."
The problem is not to solve in the cities without the inclusion of the periferia, according to the opinion of Madam Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Concevable is a combination of animals with an adverse conditioning and acute offers to allow them to reinstalle another.
Psychologue and ethnology, Uta Maria Jürgens proposed "Information panels at the place of thrombouss" to establish fullly different relationships with the "We can finally support a button in the face with a dose of confidence".
Jürgens co-funded the Ascheberger-Company-Education of Corbeilles in Schleswig-Holstein, road panels informed about the life of these very intelligent freshs.
This project was adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism about the sound caused by the birds: "If a large number of communications, these birds are many to say."
The intelligence and ability of animals are legendary: Freshes do not only use work instruments to reach a regal but also produce their own tools as work instruments.
Ethologists of the University of Cambridge had recently tested four frequencies, at the point of intelligence of birds.
In an experience, birds learned fast that they had to shoot a shooting with stones to achieve such a larve.
Without a lot of training, they certainly recognized that a stone should have some big and shape to escape the platform.
In a second test, the sweet corners should then solve a more trapped problem.
In a cylindre vertically placed, the researchers put a small seal with a larve.
The birds couldn't reach their cup with their bec.
Nevertheless, the researchers had set pieces of helmet pieces to their disposal.
All four animals formed a crochet with the help they breathed the small tissue of the small tuyau.
Three of four frequencies have been successful even since the beginning.

Personal mass battle
The new book of Peter Englind offers deep and generosity. It is called "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The beauty and the chagrin: an intime history of the First World War), it starts with a long list of personalities that smell you.
An advisory to start: take care of this page and make it your brand page.
You will learn to know these people in detail. In this Romanstic account of Peter Englind, this list of personalities will be your GPS, a ball in these moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be disappointed and disappointed in the rums of war.
Peter Englind is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also the new permanent secretariat of the Sweden Academy, which delivers the Nobel Literature Price.
He wrote here a book outside the community that he describes, with precise accuracy, as "a book of anti- History".
It includes a few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no embassy or discussions on strategies and materials.
It is not so a book on what happened, explaining it, that a "write book to what it might look like". We find the "sensors, impressions, experiences and humble."
"Beauty and Chagrin" is the experiences in war of 20 men and women more or less normally, both sides of the war, young schools and botanists at scalers, through doctors, ambulants and sellers.
Some people will be heroes.
Others of war prisoners, some will lose members, they will become crazy or lose life.
Their lives are empty here as the clergs of a church: while some starting out, they are slowly new.
The book of Peter Englind disappears from traditional history books.
It gives a dementia to the idea that the First World War is only aware of the horrible war of the throats on the western border.
"The beauty and the chagrin" describes availablely other war theatres: the Alpes, the Balkans, the Eastern front, the Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under shoes; the Christmas pass in Egypt under the piramides; the twenty-twelve shoes are an untraditional problem.
This book is slow from the first page.
The war invaded the lives of these people like a natural disaster, such as a gorgeous Katrina who able to cut it.
When canon shoots stand away and you're a mother at home, do you stay or leave?
Who will come in any way?
Soon no one can understand what happened, nor the reasons of this war.
According to Peter Englind, "the lack of facts was cut by oppositions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiratory theories, dreams, shocks and rumers."
"The beauty and the chagrin" follows individuals, such as Florence Farmborugh, an English food within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young marine of the German High Sea fleet.
Their stories are mainly subject to memories, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives may be horrible or passionnant, but are more preserved through the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most are treating privacy and ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German school, Peter Englind wrote: "Erplace, partout replacement."
"Substitute Café, false aluminium, smoking imitation, paper bands, wood buttons."
It continues on the food of replacement in Germany.
It describes the "coated rhythme made in the grain of mown (and ends with a false wood oss) ; the smoke made with seed roots and the skin skin of land powder; seeds of wooden skin."
He states that "837 authorised substitution meats are registered in the production of saucises. also 511 substitution coffees are found."
Some stories address honor and courage.
A American person recognizes his own pull against the wildness and says about the war: "You feel that, in all, men were intended to sit in a comfortable fault, a cigarette and a whisky in hand, read a newspaper or a beast, and instead of claiming that such a virus is synonym of civilization, and that there is no barbaring behind your swimming and closed chemist.
On the contrary, a British soldier realized that it can be strong to die, and that no one will not notice or give attention to it.
"When we are resigned to sacred, we hope to have a public", he wrote.
Unfortunately, it is not comparable to "un encountered man in secret".
Other comments relate to the decline of a old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict becomes more an economic competition history," wrote Peter Englind, "a war between the plants."
He entered the arrival of what he called "a new species within the bestier of the beginning of the century: the murderer of well articulated mass and convinces ideally, in well-smoking clothes, who executes his bouquet while sit behind a shopping."
People act unexpectedly; there are so many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englind speaks of soldiers who tried to get a venerian disease in prostitute in order to avoid service in front.
"We find the most largest expression in the powder trade, which soldiers purchase and sell on the genetic bodies in hope of ending in the hospital," he wrote.
"The most disappointed ones apply to the eyes, which is translated by a cecyte of life."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englind is so much but not-obscensive, perfectly adapted to his humanity task.
In decades of short scenes, he introduced the way the war had "decreased only uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, a revolution for religion. "
People start to ask why their leaders make their war.
The best books treating the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "A western nothing again", Erich Maria Remarque, instead of completed.
Peter Englind's work is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most accessible I read in a non-fictional work.
I won't find her out.
But it's like if he had surveyed from his book, enter your hands this page where the list of people is listed and burned with a wheel.
After a first false step, a minute planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some with anti-emitted boxes.
The Monday night was chosen because the Zuccotti Park would be empty.
The operation remained secret of all horses of some high-placed officers, as well as other information from the beginning of the year.
Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was in the heart of the operation, stressing the risks and challenges for the police department.
There could not be repeated episodes in the past few weeks, such as the use of feed gas against manifestants, who went against the department regulation and generated a slow of public solidarity for manifestants.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park of his manifestants was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police were prepared by observing occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against employees - anti-terrorist measures that are to move rapidly a large number of police officers - to concentrate on the Lower Manhattan district.
The last training session took place on Monday night, on the side of Manhattan of the East River.
The orders for movement to the park were reached " at the last minute " , said a habitant, referring to the operation as " a simple exercise " .
"The few of the police I know and who were called wouldn't know they would turn to the Zuccotti Park," said the person under an anonymat.
"The only ones to know that they're going to get there are at the top of the police's herarchie."
The city has stopped a lesson, where the secret of the operation was.
On October 14, the police wanted to clean the park, but hundreds of plan manifestants were resigned.
The mardi operation involved officers of various police units, including the operational forces of the whole district - decades of officers in particular criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and came to the park during the day, in the way of migrants, and then one morning's hour was a propice time.
"It was supposed to be processed when the park was less than people," he stated.
Emergency service vehicles were gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan's bridge, before entering.
The recorded lights and messages retaining high-speakers were liked to intimidate the manifestants.
While the officials in Community affairs were equipped in the blue park of their blue cut, many manifesters simply gathered their business and went away.
No temptation was touched before 1:45, which left time to the employees to gather their business.
Other police teams have been observed on the perimeter, ready to act if arrests were needed.
Journalists in the park have been forced from.
Paul J. Browne, the chairman of the police head, argued that this measure was taken only by security.
But according to many journalists, the police would prevent them from observing the intervention within the park, slowly reserved by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that the television cameras present on Church Street, west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police moved to the western through the wide range of trades of manifestants, including bags, plastic gas and clothes filled with clothes, teams of the sanitation department followed, cleaning everything that the employees left behind them.
Some manifestants who refused to leave have been traced. The images were distributed on the Internet a few days later.
The main group of manifests took place near the camping kitchen, not far from the park center.
Some have formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
A tens of people in the campsite have grown together.
Finally, two people were cast into trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the chadenas.
No arrest was held in the park before 3 a.m.30 said Mr. Kelly.
According to the police, the cleaning operation has been completed about one hour and four later.
According to Mr. Browne, about 142 persons were arrested in the park.
most for " public and rebellion " .
Joseph J. Espose, head of the police department, is the most grateful officer to be found on the places.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department of Detectives, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "not directed the operations" said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police were patient along the side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in the case of the necessary intervention.
Barricads were placed on Cortlandt Street, a house hall north of the park, and on Pine Street, south.
We've seen the police to expand the perimeter over the Zuccotti Park.
Many officers, most of them equipped with bucliers, had even been seen in pushing people to elect them.
About 28 people were from the north.
One of the most lively actions in the night took place in the south of the park.
By 5 p.m. on the south of Pine Street, a demonstrant stole on the head of a police car. Others were seen in raising the pounds of a police truck.
At a moment, a counterplay shock occurred by flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protester were hospitalized.
The Union for School Aids continues the city for Licensing
The unification that represents hundreds of school aid lost their job in the last month requires to marry the city for unnecessary and discriminatory licenses. The impact is disproportionate on schools accepting disadvantaged schools.
The continues are probably the last weapons of the Union, the 37th District Council, to try to cancelle licensements.
Sixty-two school supporters, parents coordinators and other employees, as part of the less well paid in the city, lost their job on October 7, and the trade leaders compared these licenses to a political venture to have not left the city access to a health care fund for workers groups, which would allow to closure the difference in budget at last early.
The municipal authorities denied this accust categorically.
When a municipal Council hearing last month, he said that the licensing was part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council reaffirmed that school aid licenses were not specified in the budget.
The officers of the 37th district stated that they would comply with a complaint opinion by warning the department of education that it would continue; a press conference will be organized for official advertisement of the Judiciary Progress to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
Dennis Walcott and the department of the city's education will be the defence part. The complainants will be represented by eight licensed workers, all of the black or Latin American or origin, such as most of school aids that have lost their job.
Elizabeth Thomas, the porter of the city's legal department, said that the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons of the case and therefore cannot make comments on the complaints.
According to a complaint cut by New York Times, the trademan would put the number of licenses in the most disadvantaged district schools in the city to support its complaint against inequitable treatment, declaring that the poorest schools would lose the most aid because of a regular sub-financing.
While there was no license on Staten Island, and a few in the Upper East Side or TribeCa institutions, 17 school aids lost their job in the 23th district of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th South Bronx districts.
Notwithstanding the loss of five school aids for eight employed at the public school of Harlem 36, where 68 per cent of schools live in poverty, continues claim that "This is not a district of parents who can bring funds to the lack of budget."
The public school '36 has been reduced from 3,26% this year, and funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of additional funding for each inscription of students.
The trade also argued that the directors of Legislative Legislatives could have been wrong in some terms in a memory authorized by the licensing of parents' coordinators.
The memorandum used the term "except" to describe the action, even though "passing" describes more generally the action to move a teacher from a school to a group of workers available by the Central Office.
According to the complaints project, "seventy-six coordinators of parents have been licensed" and "not only because of exceeding".
Completed mission: The Congress finds an agreement on the question of Libya
It seems to be finally that the Republicans and Democrats have found an agreement to the Capitole on the question of raising in Libya.
There would have been a successful succeeding, capture and death of the long dictator Muammar Kadhafi, as well as the American participation.
The Senate's Foreign Relations Committee will take a next march decision, supported by President John Kerry (Democrate - Massachussetts), with Senators John McCain (Republicain - Arizona) and Joseph I. Amorman (Independent - Connecticut), applauded the Libanese people for their revolt and the American troops for their "resurrection".
"This resolution is to honor Libyan's courage while they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"This is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be unfortunate, but the debate on Libya has never been simple until now.
This was a conflict by both parties legislators, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to adopt or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution to authorize the limited employment of American military forces in Libya.
The draft law was winned by a wide bipartisan margin and has never been subject to a vote in the Senate.
But the same day on the failure of the draft legislation, the Chamber of Members also rejected a measure to reduce the financing of the United States operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission was therefore remained in a form of legislative purchase - the Congress is sufficiently contrary to criticize the management of the mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the herb under his feet.
The indecision of the Congress was exceededed by events.
Tripoli was killed under the insurances in August and Kadhafi was killed last 20 October.
The NATO mission has been officially completed on October 31.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "feel the Libanese people for his courage and extraordinary determination for freedom" and "feel the men and women of the United States armed forces and their partners of the coalition in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also states "the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya".
Does the new measure support the Commission for Foreign Affairs of Senate or divid the legislators as last June?
Senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the last version.
His door speaker declared last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read all the last version of the new project.
The Chamber must vote this week to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republics of the Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure supported by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other question, to obtain a vote to put on the Chamber or Senate.
Other legislators have not yet succeeded to approve their amendments, but it is not without trying.
The Amendment of Goodlatte is part of the 68 constitutional amendments to be submitted to the Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recursive - the same law project proposed both at the Chamber and Senate - and others are low variations of a previous.
At least 15 versions of the Chamber are taken into account only on the amendment for a balanced budget, and another point that " would control federal expenditure " .
Some of these legislative projects are identical, but give their support, including the new Republicans who want to give their CV, the chance of being the author of such a measure.
The Law on Budget Control Act adopted in August last requested the vote of the Chamber and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators were voted for a non-compromising resolution supporting the idea of such a amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates in which the members of the Congress may serve, while José E. Serran (Democrate - New York) wants to reduce the limit of two mandates for the Chairmans.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrate - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments ensuring the right to quality education and health care, among others.
A amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is continuously proposed, as amendment prohibiting the prostitution of the dragon.
Some legislators also want to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if the two thirds of the States are opposed.
So it was said that they have been members of offering amendments, they are not so fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at 110th.
The chain slowed by the beginning of 1990, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two year, according to the numbers provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they have today.
The last amendment to be added - on 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Massacree but don't fight" Gabrielle Giffords said at his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after a armed man shooted him up in Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrate - Arizona) appeared on Monday night in a television, sing "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said to want to return to the Congress.
When it appeared to the television newspaper "20/20" on the ABC chain, on the side of Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords was able to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The 'emission' discussed its difficult return after the ballet that fractured his skin and lost the left side of the brain, through the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprised return to the Chamber of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt platform.
In his first television interview since January, who killed six people and blessed three other, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, rid and sing - and qualified his reconstruction of "facility".
After Diane Sawyer asked him how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, answered "before soon."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, took place at a special edition of a hour of "20/20", distributed the past of the new book of the couple titled "Gabby: a history of courage and hope".
The special emission was re-established by Gabrielle Giffords from the smoke of 8 January.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, it appeared on his hospital bed, the shocked head and a large shock on the front.
She can use only one or two dogs, with the encouragements of her husband.
Some months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sit in a routine while the doctors learn to execute simple actions.
A sign of the head.
It's a lips movement.
And finally, his first word, "What".
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords tried another word ("Toast") to ask for change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos distributed by ABC show the important role of music in the reconstruction of Gabrielle Giffords: are the Representative understood to sing with the doctors Cyndi Lauper " Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?.
When he interviewed with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who pass every two hours with the doctors, said not to remember the smoke.
According to his husband, he was reading a article on the shooting on 12 March when she stopped and asked for the first time information about the six murdered persons when the incident was killed.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, was arrested in a Missouri prison and enforcedly treated by waiting for the prosecution.
"There's been many dead," Gabrielle Giffords said to Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, stop, stop."
When she was rebuilding, Mark Kelly said to Diane Sawyer, she said, "I'm been battled."
"Don't say, Gabby, you've not been fighted," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massed.
And you're gonna get out of it, restore you and return more stronger than ever.
More Honoured than respect for the troops
The event: a gallery in Wall Street to collect millions of dollars for veterans without home from the city of New York.
Kid Rock sing a ball on imputence, frustration and lost.
Hundreds of soldiers, marine, pilots and maritimes around him.
The crowd in slaughter was cut on his feet to clause it.
"The military, men and women are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fund collection.
A high-graduate military in the gala, who also participated in the Amiral Mike Mullen, head of the United States Army State, had regarded the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were presented as a kind of orphelin," wrote the high-graduate military in an electronic mail.
I'm sure the organizations had good intentions.
I know.
But it was not respect, just the mercy.
Absolutely contradicting impressions illustrate the difficult relationships between military and a distant American public but often distant.
Rewards are made to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, declare some military.
The public works more as if he was sorry for men and women in uniformity.
"We are not all of the victims," said the chief General Sean B. MacFarland, who directed the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems to be the only way to support us is to shut us into the role of malicious spirits."
It is a very sensitive issue for military leaders who do not want to appear unacceptable or in agreement with the public they serve.
They also realize that the angry of the returning armies of the Vietnam war was worse.
Thus, the majority of the conversations on mercy took place among the veterinarians in any confidentiality.
After the return of his two sons of battle with the Marines, the colonial retradition Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service under two perspectives.
Some would view them with respect because they were faced with insured people and traveled to far away.
Others would ask whether " a veteran in anger and violence hide under the surface " said Cancian, who struggled in Iraq and returned to work to the Government in Washington.
When he searched for a job, he said, he felt that some persons who were doing him were able to ask substantively if he could keep the shock under the stress of a job required to Washington immediately after his return to the battle.
"When you address the subject of service, you are faced with negative impressions," the colonel Cancian recalls when he speaks to his sons.
Military difficulties are, in part, due to the American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely welcomed by a so little family country with the army and seeing little direct advantages of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
As a nation, we no longer appreciate the heroism as for the Second World War, " declares the representative-General Retradition David Barno, who directed the armies in Afghanistan.
Instead of that, the welcomes of political and people are widely focused on the deepness of a military suffering.
The troops are recognised for the number of periods of service, the number of lost friends or the expansion of wounds.
Army faced the growing pressure of violence against violence
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will be injured against the army for a presumed infringement on violence.
Where appropriate, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next.
The first soldier of Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant of 11 weeks in the night where she claimed to have been violated by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She returned to her house in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when she met a colleague transporting a bird package.
He asked him if he could join her in his room to drink a drink.
"C" was a alarm signal," Elizabeth Lyman says.
But the Texane took her concern on the side.
I thought, no, 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I'd have to follow my intuition."
A few minutes after being entered in the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man touched him behind, shooted by land and violent, claiming it.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other militarys, some still in service and other non-related, will be concerned about the decision of justice during a historical proceeding in Arlington, Virginia, and that will decide whether a proceeding against the former secretariat to defend Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
These are accused of not have stopped the generalization of violence within the army, thus against the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The case was classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer at the start of 17 complainants, which highlighted at 28 months following: 25 women and 3 men, all who claimed to have been violed or sexually abused by military colleagues. They also claim that the army has not investigated, continued or provided appropriate justice after the arrested attacks.
Susan Burke said to take it to the galloned military, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are individuals in place to raise the culture of resurrection? Leaders."
The lawyer also states that since February, it was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of which could be part of future judicial proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of assembling all punishers in this case - putting all its eggs into the same cart - will try several procedures, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The Defense Team, for the Department of Defence, conducted by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, has made a movement to reject the case.
The judicial documents obtained by Newsweek are detailed of the defence strategy and primarily the fact that the army cannot be continued by service soldiers or not for wounds caused in armed forces.
According to a decision of 1950 of the Supreme Court called Dr. Ferres, the Federal Government is not responsible for blessures undertaken by active service staff.
" The alleged evil is inherent to the military service of punishers " indicates the documents.
The Defence Department refused to make any comments.
The things changed since the 50s.
While women have not always officially the right to go to the battle, this distinction is only included on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely male.
In Iraq, as in Afghan, women ' s soldiers teams play a more important role, including in contact with local women.
Results: on these two wars, 150 soldiers have lost their lives - two thirds in struggle situation.
It's time for the army to modernize himself, Susan Burke.
It is not only to conduct this battle: three other procedures are undergoing more than they are.
At Yale's legal school, the Veterans' legal services centre prepares a case against the four main military academics to have themselves been encouraged to promote a mixed environment.
On the other hand, the foundation for the non-governmental purpose of Vietnam Veterans of America prepares an act against the army, focusing on the diagnostics of " personality diagnostics " assigned to the victims of violence - a relatively ordinary fact, according to the activities such as Annu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network, a Human Rights Group.
His group tried to prosecute in December to the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in order to treat advanced applications for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual aggression in the service.
nine independent law projects were submitted at the Congress by a bipartisan medium of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3.158 sexual aggressions were registered according to the Defence Defence Division's Interference and Prevention Centre (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office).
But it is well known that the number of sexual aggressions are underestimated, and in fact, according to the Pentagone's own estimation, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19.000 incidents in that year.
The report in March also examines the percentage of trial success: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases registered in the army have been subject to a proceeding - half of the percentage of the civil judicial system.
The complainants of Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first ones of a series of traumatisms.
In Lyman's case, she reported the Military Police of Violence less than one hour after the facts.
Tonight, she said, was asked to tell him 11 times in detail his violence to various police, doctors and commanders.
She slaughtered a "rape kit" (letterly a violin kit), and the blood of her aggressor - he was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sit before a judge, at a prosecution in which the question of his sexual relations with his little friend is held early in the day of its aggression.
Six people have witnessed as a witness of morality for the criminal author, which has finally been purchased.
"I remember the day where the great was returned," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I'd start to have contracts, and I'm put to cry after the court."
"I was put into psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I remembered to my commander, "I wasn't his process but my."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult an military psychiatrist, who ended by diagnosing a personality problem, making it unacceptable to the service.
In January 2010, it was returned under less honorable terms, the prevention of receiving any advantage.
Is Lyman's case or not, it's a long story, John Turley, Professor of Law at the University of Rights.
However, he noted, "In my opinion, they should be able to advance."
Only this critical doctrine since its introduction is between them and a great.
I've always criticized the Doctrin Feres.
The army has been decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and means of dissuasion as the responsibility.
"The chances are hugely against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things are only changed when the goods have the will of fighting.
If the prosecution does not turn to their favor, Susan Burke, the lawyer of the punishers, will gather his hundreds of other punishers for other proceedings.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this matter as long as there is no reform."
Wherever we'd die, one or one of the two options.
The walls have eyes: the researchers study you on Facebook
Before become the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Berring Breivik was a simple man who was part of his online anti-immigration opinions.
Monday, Breivik, who was recognised to have been taken from a murderer folie in Norway in July, which left 77 victims, was compared to his first act.
While Breivik moved alone, he was far away from being on the Cyberspace: he had spent a large part of the time before the attack on his computer, to discuss with some of the millions of nationalists who support extremely right groups on social sites.
After the tragedy of this year, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy to connect you to Facebook.
"We realize that it was not so difficult to find them", says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a report recently published by the DemoS Reflexing Group on the digital population in Europe.
Facebook maintains so many personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the website's publicity tool to find people they're looking for with a scientific specification - the way the markets do it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that a half million members are fans of extreme right groups in Europe. She targeted them with advertising, but instead of connecting them to a new group or product, the advertisements invited users to respond to an investigation. The questions related to their level of education, their attitudes toward violence and their optimism to their own future.
By contacting these people with Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues could ask 10,000 partisans of 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new way to find", says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not very surprising: online parties are instead men, young and against immigration.
But surprisedly, "they who associate online activity and outside line are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The study of DEMOS is only an example of how Facebook has become the new uncontrolled tool between the scientists' hands.
Reflexive groups, physician researchers and polytologs use the website to study all the issues touching health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I like" publications on the walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users that add averagely three contents per day, "data Supernova" generates an explosion in research, increased the number of research works that the site name appears for almost 800% compared to the past five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook resides in the fact that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach the street.
"After you were trying to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should make you party, but they would never have allowed you to enter," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have directly access to their information. "
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno from Wisconsin-Medison University, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook of their employees in ebriocy had much more chances to be alcoholic than the discreet students on this subject.
Megan Moreno suggests that student colleagues, such as advisers, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student whose status would often speak to alcohol.
"You can't handle a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-auteur of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Health, Conduction and Development of Children at the research Institute in Seattle, states Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and that wouldn't be in another unrecognised case."
Facebook also constantly accesss its users' information.
The "individual data team" studied statistics on the lovely situation and day of the Holy Valentin, the participation rate in the elections of the Middle Mandate 2010 and a national happiness index (the only available information - digital freedom fields have long supported that the site could provide its data treasurer to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the website observes them, that they like or not - in exchange to play at Scrabble with a friend that is located in thousands of miles, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard?
While researchers have well-defined designs in the way to collect information other than through the Internet, it is everything other than online.
"I don't believe that a lot of users have already thought that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, sociologue at the London Connaissance Laboratory, under a study of 2006 by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"When they knew, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then it comes to the question of methodology.
Even without passing through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two entirely different things", says Neil Selwyn.
That's why, despite his experience as technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a block and a style remain the best tools that we can use.
"No one can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to be addressed to the social aspect - and social, it is not in front of a computer."
"Froid and inhuman" : first comparison of Anders Berring Breivik
Anders Berring Breivik, the man who acknowledged to organize the two attacks that died 77 in Norwegia in this year, described as a "the resistance" fighter in his first appearance to the case in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance movement and the Norwegian Templates," he explains in a hearing room filled with 500 people.
"In the case of the court's competence, I reject it, because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting a ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognized the facts but I don't like guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he didn't want to let him use the procedure to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought with him a paper talk, talking to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
The judge Nesheim also requested the police to keep Breivik in detention for more than 12 weeks, prohibited him to talk to the media for four weeks and warned that the authorities would monitor closely all visits and matches for eight weeks.
30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some have come to hope to watch Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that it would be put behind the bars.
Everyone participated in the hearing to see the end of the proceedings.
"I found it cold and inhuman" said a survivor of Utoya at the NRK television chain.
"I wasn't on the eye, but I personally had a little advanced after I saw and heard the suspect."
In view of a dark and blue cost, Breivik remained calm and professional during the process. He watched journalists and survivors in the eyes by entering and out of the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a wide "resistance", the judge decided that he was not crazy, and he also said that there is no evidence that he has acted with companions.
The attacks on July 22 seem to be the work of an extremist instead of a whole group of roots, which may be comforted by some.
But this does not reduce the calamity or confusion of the whole nation.
"I would prefer him to be like a monster, but it's not the case," said a parents of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons from the lost interview of Steve Jobs, at the cinema this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5th, some compared it to Henry Ford - that distinguished by the modern technological and ingenitor.
But what the fans of Apple can find more revelator in a holding of Steve Jobs recently found and which will be distributed this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is how this creative spirit included the processes and flow of product work.
He was uncertainly a Creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie, but was also very methical and organized, as well as a organism improver - a man who believed that many business leaders had suffered from a "maladie that lets them think that a genetic idea makes 90% of the work... [but] a significant amount of manual work separates a generic idea of a product of exception."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series decreased the birth of the computer, and he sat for more than a hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, about 10 years ago, Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He worked hard on his new NeXT computer company, aimed at a popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of the maintenance with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have lost in the transport.
It's only after Steve Jobs' death that a complete video is found in the garage of the realizer.
This video, slightly mounted, is the base of the 68-minute film titled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be distributed to the next Monday and Thursday cinema.
For someone who knows to detect deep entertainment, Steve Jobs seems incredible here to exhibit technological philosophies and its commercial strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the study, the answers come a long time after questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, in which Steve Jobs clearly preaches his thoughts, in order to provide a specific answer.
It is also discovering moments where the perfectionism of Steve Jobs resurrected, where it seems unlike to hear the questions of Cringely, gives him cooks to accelerate and pass to questions or subjects of greater importance.
Filmed before Pixar's era, iPod or iPhone, there is an extremely predictable aspect of Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what it considers good or bad in other enterprises and is part of his own vision on the future of the information.
It's something to read the posthume evaluations of Steve Jobs' carriage, but there's something brutal and inspiring on the man we see here, the anxious dreamer at the age of the size.
He has a vision of how things can be and must be.
He explains them then to implement them later.
This is a fast recapitulative of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
In the way he learned to direct a company:
"In all these years, I always asked, 'Why do you do things?" and the answers are constantly the same, 'oh, just because we need to do it.'
Nobody knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found.
Steve Jobs continues with details about his efforts to simplify accountability at Apple.
Complete about the way the costs were recorded - often begins by a "standard cost" evaluated for nest, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated plant that guaranteed the specific calculation of the commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour at Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Boîte" that he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that would be switching telephone networks and phone freely in a long-term distance.
The device has been objected to many writings in the previous, but the euphory of Steve Jobs here in its description of the Blue Boîte as a appreciation act is countable.
It describes the way he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, spending on a call later connecting a AT and T network to another by counting as far as possible satellites.
"We're developing the ball of different things a half twice and you're shooting in the public phone, and that's happening a minute later to the public phone on the side," explains Jobs smiling.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Boîte, we learned that we could create something that could be able to control thousands of dollars of infrastructure throughout the world. "
We didn't know all the two, but we've been able to invent a small thing that could be controlled of great things. This was a amazing lesson, and I don't think that Apple would have existed a day without it.
Steve Jobs continues to tell a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak had taken: he telephoned to the Vatican with the Blue Boîte in the midst of the night by walking for Henry Kissinger and asked to talk to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic heritage are called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diploma, the two partners start to ride just before the Pope itself wake up.
About his love with technology (and marked by Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, at the chass on cutting pieces to manufacture a frequencism, Bill Hewlett's number in the year and pass a thick.
Short after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs obtained a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"This has made a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age, and it formed my definition of a company and the way the employees were treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he found the "premier office computer never designed".
He was so big as a valse, had a small cathodic tube. I went to love.
The adolescent I was back to HP and began to write programs for this machine.
On the improvement of innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks to invent new products on a head cut.
At the beginning of his career, while it is installed to sell some printed circuit cards, a customer requests him to mount a complete computer.
Working only for 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly and the delivery of the finished devices.
Then, with Apple, there are difficulties to develop a computer mouse:
"I remember great disputes... I was believed above by claiming that it would be five years [to make a mouse that costs $300]. I had enough, I was out and I went to see a designer."
Fourty-two days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that would be unbelievable.
Over the major enterprises that are expenditure:
Before Apple could not be recovered, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders would be wrong and lost the control of their market part.
"Do you work at IBM or Xerox, do you make a better copy or a better printer, and then?"
You have the monopole of the market, so the company does not meet any success.
The sales and marketing can evolving it, so [they are those types of persons] which are finally directed by the companies and the product specialized staff are made different from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopole is completely covered by people who can't imagine a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have stopped the whole IT industry.
She could have made her current size ten times. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They shocked the defeat to the winner.
On innovation as artistic form:
"A large part of manual work separates a generous idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn about his subtilities.
There are compromises to do... some things that you can't do.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling each other.
Finally, decisions are taken by personal guests. It is trying to exposure you to the best products that men have created, and to try to bring these things to the product you believe.
Picasso told a day that the good artists copy and the big artists fly.
We're always honoured to shoot out of excellent ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. People who worked above were musicians, poeters, zoologists, historists, who just got the best IT scientists in the world.
If this isn't for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas are with opposers of health law while the court is gathering
On the day when the Supreme Court is gathered at home to consider the question of political discussion, it is whether the opposition to the law of President Obama of Health will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, was noted at a dinner discussed by the Prosecutor Office that defends the case before the Supreme Court.
The event was held on Thursday last, when the nine judges were gathered for a conference to discuss requests for consideration.
One of the cases concerned was a prosecution intended by 26 States responding to the reform of ambitious health care voted by the Congress last year, a law which was a railpoint for conservators at national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5 p.m. is expected in March next, and the result will probably be of nature to promote the destabilization of the presidential course of 2012, which will be fully shocked at the time of the Court's decision.
The lawyer who will hold before the court and argue on the rejection of the law will probably be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Counsellor during the administration of George W. Bush.
PLLC Bancroft was part of the two twelve offices who helped to discuss the annual dinner of the Federalist Society (Federalist Society), a long-term group to defend conservative legal principles.
Another office that discussed the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the commercial associations that have contested the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promotor was the pharmaceutical genant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial incentive in the result of the crime.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the top Republic of the Senate, and the opposite declared the health law.
The guests see dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing against demonology rules.
In fact, the judges are exempted from a conduct code which governs the actions of the federal judges.
If they were that, they would certainly argue by the Canon 4C Code, which states: "A judge may assist fund collections of law-related organizations and other, and that the judge could not be an intervenant, an invitation of honour, or contained on the programme of such events."
However, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas near the two of the lawyers offices of the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was sufficient to warn the government ethical activists.
"This violation of the ethical and excessive inherence to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules for all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause.
"The judges drinked and dinnered, and at a collection of gala funds with lawyers with cases in the court."
Their presence and participation in the collection of funds of this event denotes any complaint of impartiality, and it is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for the critics that claim that they are too easily missing the cases of the court with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-profile warrior.
Furthermore, conservators claim that it is the judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the general complainant of the Obama administration when the first oppositions to the law were put at the level of the Court of First Instance.
Her critical pressure was made to Kagan refuse to listen to the case, saying that it was too invested in the defence of the law to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indication that she would do.
Boeing registers a recording order of $18 billion for line aircraft
The Emirates airline commands 50 Boeing 777, bi-cool line aircraft, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliners in Oman Air, a market estimated more than one billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives a order covering 50 of its products.
This is instead a case when the company concerned is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and that the amount of these 50 aircrafts reached the amount of $18 billion.
It's also unbelievable from whom Boeing received this command: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft commands.
In Monday, the company of Chicago estimates that the airlines in the Middle East will need in the next 20 years of 2 520 airlines of a total of $450 billion.
In the weekend, Boeing informed the command of commercial aircraft in his history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-colarics.
It's the airline Emirates based on Dubai, who took this pharaonic command.
Boeing announced at the Dubai Aviation Salon 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy more than 20 flights, which would increase the total amount of $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated Monday that the Oman Air company commanded six Boeing 787-8, on behalf of Dreamliners, a model that flew out of significant fuel and commodities for passengers.
The amount of these six devices is more than one billion dollars.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst of the Morningstar.
"They, in particular, have a great value."
In the Middle East, oil producers countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means of paying these aircrafts but also the amount of the fuel price - of a prejudiciary for airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so nice because the country would win the money with the amount of the oil price.
It is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or divide their aircraft commands when the oil price increased, reported out.
"They have a natural risk cover," he said.
Emirates' command strengthens Boeing's predominantity on the market of large-scale aircrafts and helps to shut up the airbus competitor's airbus test with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aircraft hall arrives four months after the Airbus advertising to report the starts of the largest version of A350, which is directly evaluated with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus rejected his starts to increase the shipment after requesting its customers to increase its loading capacity and self-employment.
Boeing company actions increased by 1.5 per cent to reach $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico expressly struggles to the elections of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that the drug traffickers have helped his rebellious Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the course at the ruler's position.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost its attempt to access Michoacán's governance functions during violent elections, and she declared Monday that the drug traffickers have favoured one of its opposers.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Constitutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was headed by the Governing position of the Western State.
"The intervention of the crime organized during the whole vote process and in particular last night is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," reported Luisa Maria Calderon at the radio during a interview on Monday after the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... they put rings, installed road bars... and forced the people to vote." for the PRI.
PRI ruled the Mexico for sixty-10 years to lose the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
PRI hopes to win the 'president election' in July.
Vallejo seems to have been noted just a few Calderon, who was heading of the reviews before the elections.
Calderon, a candidate of his brother's conservator party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognise Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who is currently dominating the functions of the Governor, has occurred in the third, a punishable defect before the 2012 presidents for this divisive and devastating left.
Aureole also refused to recognise the first results.
Vallejo, the former Master of Morelia, the capital of the State, had all linked to drug traffickers, and he well advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartles specialized in the trafficking of marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the 'Etat of President Calderon', and he chose Michoacán to initiate a military offence against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has continued.
A week before the elections, a PAN master was killed while he was camping for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have left locally to the campaign by fear.
However, for the PRI, also corrupted as Michoacán's elections have the air, a victory will help the party in his chain.
The man we expected to represent the PRI in the course of the presidentials, Enrique Pena Nieto, welcomed Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think that this victory is very encouraging for the next year."
BASD urges Asia to be assisted in the euro area
Asian Development Bank asked India and China to prepare for the euro area to help out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decrease that would prevent Asian economy's development.
Rajat Nag, director-General of the BASD based in Manille, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growth in the world had to "make everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area by the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He has noted the BRICs (Brasil, Russia, India and China) to consider the difficulties of Europe's "unnecessary eye" and reported that a Asian financial support to the leaders and resources of Europe would allow "eviting a long-term escape of the global economy".
"We are all together in this crisis."
"For whoever can help Europe to get out of the crisis is useful," he said in the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected until a certain point, but it is not open."
"Don't China and India help, that nothing can prevent them."
The euro area has been seriously broken by a crisis of sovereign debt.
Recently, the cost of Italian employee has been dangerously mounted into fleet, and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have dismissed.
The growing crisis of the sovereign debt in Europe has struck the fear that the world economy will not return to recession, and has emphasized the call for the main economies to meet to help the euro area to find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that the FMI would sell all Asian aid, but also stated that this bilateral assistance - as to purchase the obligations of the financial relief fund of the United States, the European Financial Stability Fund - would provide a greater power to negotiate with Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce and India Industry, stated that "India will do everything it will" to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in export and a rate of income of foreign capitals.
"Another one wants the euro area to remain instable and affected," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to emerge, and we must keep a high level of growth."
"What isn't a choice, it's a imperative, because where would we find work for the decades of our young men and women?"
Others support that development economys such as India should not help European riches while face their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at Brown University in the United States, stated that it would be very difficult to accept Europe's assistance to the 1,2 billion Indians, with at least 8000,000 live with $2 per day, or less.
"Another day they will find that the Greeks take their retreat to 50 years of age and that they go to the sun, and they will have badly to wake it," he reported.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reservations should be used to maintain a number of Greek officials well paid in misleading jobs generating losses, such as the rail sector.
Mr. Nag said that the crisis of the euro area was risked to cause "important impacts" through Asia.
BASD's previsions of an economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 are now faced with the "risk of loss" because of the European threat.
He reported that vulnerable markets needed to develop "assurance plans" in order to protect economic return and significant capital flyings.
Severe warnings from Pentagon on potential defence reductions
The Secretary of Defence, Leon Panetta, made the pressure on the Monday Congress, warning that imminent automatic budgetary compressions would know national security, and has deployed a financial reaction in the Pentagon fleet camps in Afghan sights, through civilian assemblies.
The Pentagon already digs $450 billion for the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more compression would be imminent if the Congress does not reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastators for the Ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Senator John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that the failure of the Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in sequestration would lead to 23 per cent of reductions and the gear of many new projects.
"A very important reduction, applied so without discretion, would make the majority of our ships and projects of unsuccessable construction - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and bring seriously reached to other modernization efforts", wrote Panetta to Senators.
"We would also be able to separate us from a certain number of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be taxed so fast, we should almost send citizens to pay for the purpose."
"These changes would raise the faith of those who support our militarys and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would eventually touch the fighting armies, continue Panetta.
"Before the financing in war accounts for foreign contingency operations is not directly affected by the sequestration, the war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disorders in the basic budgets," reported Panetta.
"A contracting staff would be reduced, involving delays in contracts and the supervision of contracts supporting the war."
"Other salary staff would be reduced, implying payment delays to war providers, and legal and political support would be detrimental."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days later, demanding details about the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a sequestration on the Defence Defence Department would decrease a rapid decline in the United States as a world leader of military power."
"We are fairly opposed to this dramatic action," Senators said in a common Monday after midday after the publication of Panetta's letter.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it's certainly not what we should impose."
"The sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not be to happen."
The Panetta letter and the recent warnings of senators increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or call for exemption of the Pentagon Reduce, remains to be viewed.
Panetta has been more virulent about possible compressions, even though it has been reached at the highest post of the Pentagon, cumulating years of budget expertise at the Congress and the White House, and knowing that it was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Secretariat painted a dark table of what could happen - a military with a coke, but not a noyau.
"It's a ship without marine."
"It's a bride without balls."
"It's a chase aircraft, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of households, buildings and bombs that aren't enough to comply with the mission," Panetta stated at his pre-liminar comments at Pentagone.
"It is a depressed, badly prepared and unable to face potential opposers."
"In fact, she calls for aggression."
In an addendum to his letters in McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could "generate important operational risks: the time for response to crises, conflicts and disasters; serious limitations to our capacity to run and launch us in the world; and the risk was unacceptable in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could pass through the cutting, including those already tested and some just in the first cities of planning.
The list included the Fighter F35 Joint Stric, a new planned bomb, the Balistic Submarine of New Generation, the new littoral fight ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of Army and Sea.
A term of development and testing of F35 could generate 80 billion of economics over 10 years, but its parties say that it is an essential step to improve and respond to the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to make a lie
A view of the recent smells indicates how falseness and lie are represented in daily life.
The Republicn candidate to the President Herman Cain is occupied to exchange sexual harvest with several women; each side accused of lie.
Penn State Administrators were accused of being sentenced to have pretendly covered reports that a football trainer at the retreat has sexually aggressively aggressived boys.
Last week, the French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by a open microphone confirming President Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a mentor.
The lie has destroyed carriages and convulsed countries.
The member of the New York Congress and the celebration of the Internet Anthony Weiner, passed to an idiot by quickly posting controversies by irrefutable evidence.
The former candidate to the President John Edwards was accused of violations of the financing of the campaigns related to the coverage of an extra-jugale link.
And then, no one who lived in the story will never forget the mediatic circle that President Bill Clinton has delayed by mentioning in his second mandate on his sexual implication with Monica Lewinsky.
The tricky records at the school tests and university are legitimate.
There have been cases where teachers gave the responses to student tests to see their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send the message that lie and tricky are acceptable.
How many of them are to meet us?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 libraries.
In fact, many of them are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners have three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detection or repair of lies is an essential competence that each one must purchase, both for personal and professional reasons.
Unlike being a likely company game, we say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I have you", the detection of tromper is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected during the last six decades in prestigious universities who have conducted a research in a deep range of projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the research results is that the oldest myths on lie have been demisted.
Mentors look at you in the eyes.
They do not behave, smell or do not always.
Don't conclude that mentors are difficult to detect and detect.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by considering the structure of the declaration, the facial micro-expressions, the training of the question and the time of response.
I have been several years to examine scientific results in the wide body and always experiencing knowledge of trompery, and it is clear that the detection of tromper is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include employees, interviews, negotiations or management.
Good mentors are able to read others well, put them into the eye, generating their own feelings and intuitively discovering how others understand them.
We know according to research that extravertis mention more than introvertis, than men say "centred on them" while women say more lies "centred on the others" - normally to protect the feelings of someone - that marriage persons are less often lacking to their partners than the unmarried persons (but the lies they say have tended to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as an incrédible, others will feel less guilty of you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "set the rear data".
This helps to provide a reference point to measure later changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, rise, vocal quality.
You must know if someone normally removes his feet in continuity so that you do not start injust accusions when you see it to remove the feet in the meeting.
Then search for verbal and non-verbal false behavior indexes.
Consider these indexes as red dragons, not evidence of falseness.
False people can immobilize the upper of the body when they try to remember their history, they can put their feet to the door, shoot to an outdoor, changing posture in a significant manner, or present a post-interview - an exagerate shooting shooting, a switch change when all difficult issues are passing.
The questionnaires often indicate that the maintenance is completed just to seek to disable post-interview reaction.
So, take care of the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson was depressed by using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, starting a national research to find her.
Mentors can also use a remote language: "I haven't had sexual relations with this woman... Ms. Lewinsky" or fully repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when he answers a difficult question: "Now... to say true... if I remember goods... to my knowledge."
This makes the perceptive response instead of factual and is often a red dragon.
There is no magic form for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize falseity is possible.
These skills will improve the opportunity of anyone to avoid victimization by angers in their professional and personal life.
The controversial olive oleoduc plan will be delayed after the threat to the late approval of the United States
A few days after the Obama administration was threatened to delay the approval of an oleodide project between Canada and the Mexico Golf - raising the wrath of the trade unions by the environmentalists - the company seeks to build the oleoduc said that it is ready to redirect the project to redirect it on rail.
TransCanada said Monday night that she will move the pipeline designed out of the ecologically sensitive area of Nebraska's duties, and it is confident that the project will win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Headquarter of Nebraska.
TransCanada's officer, Alex Parabax, claims that the company remains confident that it will end by obtaining the approval of a oleoduc, but with a different item.
This is due to the advertising by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permission for the project until he receives new studies of potential rents to avoid the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala Water, wide subterranean water sources.
"This is a real way towards the front," says Lee Terry, a Republic of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new survey of the environment commanded by the State Department had probably renewed any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although officials dismiss the participation of policy in the decision.
Obama, in a statement written last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed its support.
The oleodide of 2,735 km was extended from Canada to the Golf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 bars a day from the province of Alberta to the Texas raffineries.
In order to do this, he would have to pass through six States.
It is hate by ecologists, but loved by working groups, which took up 20 000 jobs estimated with oliveduce.
But the legislators of Nebraska opposed to this plan are pressing that a law for force is far away from the Sand Hills region and Ogallala Water, a major source of potable water and irrigation.
The study of the current environmental impact of the Department of State found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, which covers two questions.
One is that a lobbyist employed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor of Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is to know whether an undertaking that has been employed to conduct the initial study was an inadequate choice of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle continues for pretendly caused a young kid to scare
A family in New York claimed that the divisive Disco Patti LaBelle launched in a violent disappearing hall in Manhattan's building, terrified their little daughter at the point where she was scared of fear.
The strike of the song "Lady Marmalade" stripped the small Genevave Monk of 18 months, as she had been "changing personality, sleeping troubles" and "the increased fear of foreigners", she said during the Prosecution of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was 10 November of the last year when the technicist of Kevin Monk, his teacher wife of children's garden, Roseanna, and Genevave were preparing to travel to family.
While Kevin Monk was going to search for the car, Roseanna Monk went down in the hall of their riverside buffet building with their bags, bringing Genevive into his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she was arrested near the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"What happened behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said "Yes" and I went to find her, she said.
LaBelle admonished with angry the pregnant woman.
"He told me about your aggressive, "You should not leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I answered him, "what you say or do not think I'm not interested."
She became enraged and began to use jurons - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a water bottle and began waiting for me from the bottle's water.
She said that at this point, Genevave became hysterical.
"I said to the woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle went on the mom - who was always holding Genevave in his arms - and had to be guarded by his surrounding that led her to a car that was waiting for them, said Roseanna Monk.
The girl smile so strong that she took off, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note requesting for forgiveness from LaBelle, but no answer was received.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims non-specified damages, but the lawyer, Sam Davis, declared that he took the case free and that the family plans to give all money to a charity work against cancer for children.
"The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially to a mother teacher with a child of 18 months."
Climate adversity has hindered the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, the unemployment and informality has increased, foreign investment has decreased and the economy was contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, which is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, who has generated great expectations for the development of the economy, but given the climate contrast of the beginning of the year, increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The lower temperatures of February, in addition to loss of billions for the agricultural sector, have limited the potential of the State economy for growth, resulted in general in the economic activity of 3,6 per cent in the first half of the year, which was mostly justified by 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamicism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of the heats issued by the Mexican Rurale Development Council, 582 million hectared 835 hectares were damaged, with 78.03 per cent of the total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent suffered partial damages, the main criminal cultures were fruits, measuring and cheeks.
The decline of economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in the unemployment in the State, according to the National Statistics and Geographic Institute, the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year, in the second quarter of the year, increased, as in March 55,053 syndicates were unemployed, with a rate of 4,53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, the rate was 5,28 per cent to September and the average increased up to 6,19 per cent, which represented more than 74 thousand sympathies, an increase in the first quarter of 969 people.
Mining of liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the UAS Economic and Social Sciences Faculty, the increase in the unemployment can be explicit indirectly based on actions carried out by public policy.
"What we observe is a increase in the unemployment that has been made to several factors, including market liquidity loss due to a restriction of resources approved in the Congress to combat money whiteness, because for people who win the dollars in an illicit way is not easy to work to win them, invest and use them in something," he says.
Migration detained
López Cervantes reported that the increase in the unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of persons who leave the State to go to work foreign, the United States has been limited, first because of income difficulties, and secondly because they have already had a lot of difficulties to find work, these people remain here and ask for work sources, which makes unemployment increased," said it.
Serial lack
The analysis of the Sinalonia Labour Market is increased by considering the high level of lack of serious work that predomines between the working conditions, according to NNGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state and works without cotising as a worker in no social insurance institution.
In addition to the unemployment and the lack of seriousness, the entity has the lower payment of the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute for Social Insurance and the Work and Social Prevision Secretariat.
The average month income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 weights, very less than the national average, which is 7 000 375 weights.
IED contract
In addition to the decline of economic activity and unemployment increase, in 2011, it was registered the strongest reduction of the Estrangre Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Economic Secretariat of January to June the State IED reached $630,697, which represents a decrease of 87,74 per cent of the $5,143,000 312 registered in the same period of the previous year.
At its turn, the Government ' s Economic Development Secretariat accounts for a total of 17.280 billion weight per year, which is mainly registered by the Territory Sector companies.
Debt
In view of the economic contraction scenario, the State's government requested in July the approval of a credit of 3 billion weight for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State congress was of 2.600 billion weight and until November no benefit of the engagement in any State economy sector.
Reactions
For the representatives of the patronal sector, Mario López Valdes' first year shows the lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Transformation Industry Chamber, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The income of Sinaloa's economy during this year was really very poor, it must be intensely worked to recover the field we have lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, and in particular the good step already synchronized by this new government team, hope that the next year is much better", said he.
Economic Legend
Loredo López stated that events such as the helmets of the beginning of the year have decreased the economy of the State and limited its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced of several events, including the genders, one of the main effects has been a short economy that does not turn enough to generate an economic dynamics that allows us to have an acceptable and flux level in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we will close much below the expectations we had."
Reset Vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Patronal Confederation of the Republic of Sinaloa, said that it would be changing the State towards productive activities more dynamics.
"In general terms we have noted that it has been worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefinies the state's vocation and economic direction, as it is important that the potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources is highlighted", he says.
Many to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a future vision that enhances the efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in various areas, in the field of economic development there are some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme", he states.
He reported that the current administration had made progress in the manner of public policy.
" There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, which I can say is that it has been worked many and the Government is aware of the fact that there are still many to do", he says.
Condemned for 8 kilos of marihuana
A person living in Novolato was sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days of office for eight kilometres of marihuana.
The General Park of the Republic reported that the small condemned trafficker was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for crime against health, in its variety of marihuana ownership for sale.
In accordance with the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a supervision operation on the Cypriano Valdez Street, before the 80th number in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small tractor circled in a type pick-up truck, white, in which he carried a black shirt in the car bag port and on the copilote place a small sack to two where military forces found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confidence elements were made available to the Second Court of Department, and the sentence is still in the Code of the Criminal Consequence Center.
Debt to work contributions
The works of social nature contained in programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescate and 3x1 for migrants may not be finished where to register serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, Michael Angel López Miranda reported.
The Social Development Director stated that even if the construction programmes have progressed, they are in a risk situation, since the Government of State has not obliged to offer contributions exceeding 11 million weight in the three programmes.
He reported that the investment of these three programs is almost 50 million weight, which the State must provide 25 per cent and only the Federation and the Municipal has provided resources for workers, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the short end of the year, they have not given us anything, although since July they had to give us a part," he said, "and we, to not register a delay, we started the books and we have made much progress, but we need money."
He stated that the last year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration, the Municipe had to request a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided to that occasion.
"We had already been understood this in the previous sexual period because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to work and this year, to have access to these programmes, we have got the resources to cover what the State had not paid", he details.
Despite the engagement of the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management so that the corresponding percentages were reached as soon as possible.
"They must provide nearly 12 million, although the year will soon end, they didn't give us anything."
The valid "the similar punishment" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of similar signals by digitals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered over the last few years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has delayed the constitutional disputes made by the Senate and Chamber of Members against the Presidential Decree, which extends the term " analogic copper" from 2021 to 2015, since the eight votes required for invalidation have not been gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderon had not exceededed his attributes when he issued the decree that details the actions to follow to the earthly digital television transition.
Consequently, the Constitutional Conflict Promoted by the Senate of the Republic has been decreed in order to not reach the qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court continues to enter into force on the Constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the Decree.
The draft sentence, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the decree as non-constitutional because the radio and television regulation is an assignment reserved to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contrast to the principles of hyerarchic subordination and law reserve.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero even.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Members promoted two constitutional controversies to contest the decree and with the appointment of complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the Decree and all action planned by the Decree for Digital Transition.
The plenary meeting of the Ministers also discussed the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputy, without discussing the project which the Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In its intervention, the President said that it was not agreed with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general standards the measures to prepare public administration.
"I do not consider only if it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that planning of public policies in strategic areas as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive Executive, which has for constitutional rule of the State.
The replacement of similar signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered over the past few years, and it is translated into a better operation of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more strings.
To join the change, it would be supported by the benefits of digitalization that includes a decision of public interest which is not only a technical dimension, "for this includes also economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, underlined, "exigent the operation of a system established in accordance with the State's economic principle, includes a group of attributions granted by the Constitution to the functionality of the State's executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries of the world have already finished digital transition, and they did it through the Executive, despite their extremely specialized technical bodies.
It is not possible to conclude that the Executive, by deleting the contested decree, has in a manner of competence of the Congress, as it ensures that it respects the laws issued by the legislative laws in the administrative sphere.
The possibility of a "sesting vote" in Michoacán is analyzed
According to the data shown by PREP, the difference between the first and the second place of the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting of the votes corresponding to the 879 of 6 000 74 total procedures.
The possibility of the vote vote is a reality in the election process this year in Michoacán, where, according to the data shown by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and the second place of the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without accounting of the votes corresponding to the 879 of 6 000 74 total procedures.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), Maria of the Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that, on 9 November last, the election body adopted a number of guidelines to harmonize local standards for the federal election reform.
It should be remembered that Michoacán has not approved or its Political Constitution or the Electoral Code of State or its Electoral Justice, while the Congress of the State has adopted reforms short before the end of the legal period to enable the election process to enter into force and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has prohibited its publication within the periods provided by the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that it had some objections.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy that was promoted by the local legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State Manager for Constitutional Reforms, since it has no right to "sanction or contest".
Interviewed on the possibility of vote, Maria de los Angeles Llanderal said that by the approval of the guidelines corresponding by the General Council of IEM, it will be possible to achieve the partial and total discounts of the votes by the local election body.
Thus, the part of the votes, one or several election packages, may be only: the results of the non-conciliation procedures; there is no scrutin-verbal proceedings and discounts in the urn folder are not found at the President of that; or there are obvious errors or advertisements of the verbal proceedings.
Furthermore, the total discount of the votes received in all the wrestles of the election may be carried out when there is an index of the fact that the difference between the candidate intended to win the election and the second place in the election is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is a express request from the representative of the party and/or coalition that presented the second candidates.
The total depth of the vote may also be achieved if at the end of the common detachment it results that the difference between the proposed candidate and the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose second candidate has been issued, where the electoral packages were excluded.
It should be said that this is the situation of the Morelia election, where, according to the PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, even without accounting for the votes of 129 of 923 total procedures.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The First Minister, Mario Monti, will gather tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the border of the economic disaster
The First Minister, Mario Monti, will join the President of Italy to present the new government that will face an Italian crisis on the edge of economic disaster and threatened the whole Eurozone.
A chairman of the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet with the President, Jorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it could form the Government.
It is expected to present a office consisting of its majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will take its post.
Monti said he would present the President the outcome of his conversations with the political parties in his trial to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the capacity of our country to overcome this difficult stage," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that it could form a government, but the ton of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The framework is now well taken", he adds.
Monti complemented the process to form a government less than three days, in a lower time than normal, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has put its debt costs to be unable to support.
The new administration directed by the former European Commissioner Montei must approve a hard scope of authenticity required by European leaders to recover the confidence in Italy.
Recalling the pressure on Monte to defeat, the instability of the markets to place the performance of Italian BTP obligations up to 10 years above 7 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland have been saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, the leader of the Italian leader Confindustria, said to the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity to get Italy out of this emergency situation.
Monti's success opportunities were significantly stimulated by supporting the Silvio Berlusconi PDL Party, at which the crisis forced to dismiss the past Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," said the press Angelino Alfano, secretariat of the Right Centre party.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant since many of its members were opposed to the Government of a technocratic majority as Monti until now.
Parliamentary Support
The new Government of Monteni must have a strong Parliamentary support to implement what may be impunity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastative attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks was added to pressure by noting that a Montei failite would be a disaster.
Monti began to celebrate its consultations with the political, trade unions and patronal groups and youth organizations and women.
He will end his tour of lunch meetings at night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled a very fast transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief reply at the end of the last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to dismiss, the costs of Italian debt are now incurred at critical levels between the uncertainty of the success of the new minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defence of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue to future elections, planned for 2013, despite generalized predictions, the fact that politicians will only give him the time to implement the reforms before the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but large parties stress that it should only be formed by specialists, a index of their objections before a financial pressure process.
Political sources reported that reciprocal disabilities and deficiencies between parties complicate the trial to include political figures.
Spain experience is higher than the Coarcans
22 ballers called Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 guests participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to Costa Rica, compared with the 22 convocated by both countries for the friendship today at 15:05 p.m. at San José National Stade.
While national and European champions, the number of one of the monthly classification of the FIFA, contain a range of inter-electional games of class A, Tricolore only has the Defender Michael Humana as the only 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Thursday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers playing in the League of Stars and the powerful clubs of the Premier League of England maintain an intense activity in national links and cutting championships and disputes in European cuts such as the League Champions.
All this needs to be added to the experience of Furia Spain during the complicated eliminations of the European Coupe and the World Football Coupe.
Coastal footballers, on the other hand, have an international experience limited to a zone such as Concacaf, which is considered to be lower in the FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish Selection is the of the igiker Casillas guard, who was previously against England (defence 0-1 in London) equivalented to the record of the former guard of Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will today play against Tricolor and they will put a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, a brain flight of Barcelona, in 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognised the previous week by the EUFA in account of the other hundreds of the flight team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the former centre of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Preparation of the census number is found in Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
From the coastal side, and near Michael Humana is the left lake Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the buyer Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five over the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazola (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even 20.
While Nao Moreal has only four games and Jord Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not begin.
The historical buyer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 moulds, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinto included the country in his tour to celebrate two decades of trail
"Come to Costa Rica is a dream that has become real."
In the exclusive interview with Viva, the bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday on the National Stade.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group ensures that there will also be a dream to become a reality in that country.
It is that the Bassist and founder Jeff Ament assured, speaking only with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South America fleet of its celebration tour of two decades of work, and on Sunday 20 will be its unique scale in Central America.
This day will be presented on the National Stade at 19:30 p.m. next to the Los Angeles The X group and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract of the conversation, which is completely translated in the Internet Nation.
For its coastal addicts, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen to Costa Rica is a dream to become real. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become real for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America, and it has been great until now.
I passed to Costa Rica just once the holidays; it's a so beautiful country and I think we can pass there for a few days.
This is why we feel to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion towards the group, the fans live intensely in the previous days.
What is your message for your most suitable fervents?
Thank you for staying next to us all these years.
We had 21 years to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so much and we're sorry for the fact that there's been so much time to this concert.
Some people already say that their concert is the largest show of the year.
Is this added a bit of pressure to your visit.
Some of the larger shows that we offered during the last 21 years have occurred in the last two weeks.
We offered a two gigantic shows to Sao Paulo and hope that this has made us in form for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are very inquired of producing it.
We love this country, we like to make a surf and a jewel; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries of the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its vagues to make surf?
We have a lot of superb friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the vagues are incredible there.
My friends were always going to make a surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, in the coast of Mexico, are large places to make surf; so we learned it through the boys who love the surf.
By seeing the tour, you have offered great shows, with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never been produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We'll try to make the best show possible, with a great variety of songs; we'll try to interpretate two songs of each album and offer our fans a good and different directory.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is that supposed to be?
I think that's partly because we've got nine disks and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each one loves different songs, so it's very difficult to choose what songs to interpret each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have no longer interpreted for a long time, this helps us to stay concentrated and surprised because this reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we could forget.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think that it is also more interesting for people.
With this tour, you'll celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
When looking back, is it difficult to believe everything you have succeeded?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think that no one of us had imagined that we would form a large rock group, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years as it seemed to be a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together feels much.
We love and worship music.
We're lucky to go to the world's places where we always wanted to go.
The things couldn't go better for us.
What does it mean for you that you have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grung?
This has always been a honor to form part of this group of great groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a move appears from a group of friends and is little common.
Of time in time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups get out at the same time of the same city.
We are proud and it is a honour to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still play with some of them in time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in their tour, so we are lucky to be friends with them and it's a honour to become part of the sound of Seattle.
It's so strange that a group like your unix and with the same members for so much time.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and it's only much more time than many groups normally.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive and, secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give each experiment.
We have confidence in each other with the music of each one and that couldn't go better.
Your relationship with the célébrity has not been easy, but, thanks to your success, you could do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew, it was easier to find us a balance.
We assure that we do not pass too much time on tour because it's easy to break into this game of the great multitudes and people who love your music.
If it is not forgotten that people are here for music, it helps us not forget that we need to respect music and what has brought it, without putting in mind the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which really does not interest in any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we've written good songs, and at the beginning it was great.
We've been a group for almost three years and we have not published a disk before Andy's death.
There have been a lot of frustrations for the fact that she has longed so little and the most important thing is that we are still very friend with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I hear a song or I see a photo I think about the amazing person that Andy was and how he was riding, it was always a joy to work, rise, talking about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being, and he missed us.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose it for opening?
Yes, the production has sent us videos with different proposals, and it was the group we loved most, so we are surprised to see what Las Robertas can offer directly and that must be very distracting.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbetter's words directly?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
It's him who sing her and I think he's doing it with the first words he imagines.
As bassist, what are his influences?
There's a lot of...
One of the first ones I remember is Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could speak all the afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam successfully maintain the relevant grung, despite the fact that it isn't anymore?
I think we all feel a little unconnected from the grunge word.
When I think, this reminds me of the groups I've come to mention, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have occurred at the same time and, if this is now relevant, I think that it's wonderful, because it's a music that is worth listening and groups like Mudhoney now makes the best music than ever.
At the beginning, his music had more dark and now it has become more positive.
What should this change be made?
It's interesting, because I believe there are songs in the new album that look more slower, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe qualified as dark songs, even if they can sound a little positive.
With the two, when Ed played them for me, I cryed when I heard them and these are deeply dark songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things start to influence your art and music and these songs, of course, represent this for me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even as we can do the dark music.
Peru:
Re-hospital Fujimori for medical examinations
The former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscular force he presented in his feet, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years of age, who pursue a 25-year-old prison for human rights violations during his Government (1990-2000) suffers from various affections, including a language cancer for which he has been operated four times and which is under control.
The Congressist Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, declared for Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days in the National Institute of Neoplastic Maladies to determine the cause of pain and strength loss in its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that, in his view, Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of punishment for humanitarian reasons, he certainly said that he did not want him because he felt innocent.
He has been operated four times of language cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilograms, and other pathologys such as a severe gastronomy, a ski of pancreas, renal calculations, blood hypertension and traffic problems in the feet, abolished the doctor.
Fujimori cleans the resolve since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for the death of 25 persons because of an armed anonymation scandal that operated in the first years of his government.
Music travel to Mexico to consolidate political links
A official court, headed by the Uruguayn President, José Mujica, and formed several ministers and patrons, will initiate a visit to Mexico to extend trade between the two nations and address political themes in the region.
Mujica will join next Monday with its Mexican homolog, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long meeting agenda with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayn community in Mexico, according to the Uruguay Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "acceptable for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the President of the South America country on its website.
According to the local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderon to support Uruguay in the incident with France that was held when the French mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of fiscal paradise, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his conversation, Sarkozy threatened countries that continue to be fiscal paradise, a statement that caused the rejection of Uruguay and calls for consultations from his ambassador of this European country.
The President of Mexico since November the G20, a group of emergency and stronger developed countries in the world, has entered into force with the South America country, since January this year, a Convention to exchange tax information to avoid double tax.
The Government of Uruguay has tried to decrease the processing of fiscal exchange agreements for the "great list" of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OCDE), integrated by countries which do not comply with all international fiscal cooperation standards.
In the trade, Mexico and Uruguay have entered into force since 2004, a free trade Treaty (TLC) which increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustach plombier passes on three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario was infatigable, for 25 years to save the princess Peach of the wicked Bowser's acts, but he never did it in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young man in stereoscopic technologie.
The title, which arrives this month to the world's stories, has been designed since the beginning to exploit the features of the mobile Nintendo 3DS console, which allows to play in three sizes without using lunetts.
"Mario is the personality that must say how to work the stereoskopy without lunettes", said the specialized printer in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally designed for this support", because until now successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adjustments of existing titles.
Nintendo supported that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid part.
Alvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "small" to increase the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts can do a "second tour" at the level of game, which is more difficult.
Furthermore, users will be able to choose real time between a "D aggressive" or one who only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "no matching optical illusions".
This super Mario incursion in the three dimensions also requires the return of personality to a mobile console, which has not been passed since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes an eye cline to the saga adeptes and repeats the form of success of the previous games, which consists of the fact that the moustachu plombier must pass through mining pellet platforms to free to Prince Peach.
Even if I player find newness in movements, environments, costumes and enemies, and also in the cases of Luigi "joy".
Colum gives his avail to Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alberto Colum announced the last Monday that he had given for the extradition of the former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for conspiration for the whiteness of 70 million US$.
This ends the case so that Guatemala responds to the request of the northern country who claimed to Portillo to judge it.
In press conference, Colombia stated that his decision obeyed the independence of the judiciary and executive authority, taking into account the fact that a first court had already ordered its extradition.
He stated that during his mandate "he had not helped" in no judicial resolution, and he had given a course to all extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will also be extracted for serious murderers and lessons, and Edgar Strerada Morales and Victor Strerada Parderes will be extracted for drug traffic.
What Colum predicted for an executive approach after he slaughtered all the judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former mandate of the 2004-2004 period.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Penal Court and the Court of Constitution (CC), Porillo should be extracted after solving its legal situation in Guatemala and after safeguarding its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for the distortion of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was the President, which was the case before the extradition, but the Public Minister called and reacted the case.
Trinijove helped 6.000 young people in risk situations
The entity is born to avoid marginalization of young people without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of Trinijove social support unit is important: 6.000 young people in risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation during the fourth century.
This adds the long census of work positions currently obtained by this social group.
The birthday served last year to make the balance in a celebrated act in an old industrial complex of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the goal of helping less formed, without work, with drug problems or marginalized issues.
The celebration in Sant Andreu has focused on a large number of entities and institutions who had cooperated with the association in these 25 years.
The variety of political representation, in full election season, showed the unilateral nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Under the President of the Regional Government Catalan (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jord Pujol, the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former adjoint master at the master and current eco-socialist municipal adviser Ricard Goma.
The current Minister for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director-General of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he stated that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time, and the current is also it, but he added that the work done until now is "that's a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove, for example, to know how to fight against the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficult times.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and the work that it does", he states.
Properties invaded by squatters for micro-feasts, evacuated
The guards were suitable from 11 of 13 building apartments in Balmes, 51
12 employees left the property at midday without any resistance
Everything seems to be shown that the cachemar that the residents of Rue Balmes 51 lived out.
Twelve people were volunteerly abandoned the building that they were illegally employed and where they were organizing micro-feests that dismissed neighbors, by judiciary order and without a police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door closed was changed to avoid that the situation is repeated.
"After that day there will be a control of access", the Administrator states.
The squatters, which had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the remaining were living -, brought the electrical installation and a part of the water, instead of painting the walls and leave them residues of any kind, especially alcoholic drinks bottles.
The first three apartments were the scene of the mass feasts, which dumped up to two days and disappointed the localists.
Near the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
His owner, Maria Pantinat explained for Europe Press that its business has decreased 80% since the building's occupation.
The owner of the disk said that the owners of the owners were able to make him unfaithful, because they sold the sellers to three euros, while they were in the disc 10.
In addition, the owner of the loaser place had to respond to the neighbouring complaints, while, according to this, the innocents were not caused by the discotheque clients, but by the people of the busy home and particularly by the participants to the organized festivals there, which were more frequent and intense in the past weeks, according to the irrelevant neighbours of the area.
The owner of the disco explained that the clouds were so large that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building, and that makes nine months that the "he forgives".
The Watch Tower of Urbana (Municipal Police) also confirmed that the last weeks they received more complaints from the neighbourhood.
The president of the Mujicipal Group of the Mayor PP, Alberto Fernández Díaz, requested the last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end with the communal and civic life problems that it caused residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only a stage of the building was busy, but the squatters had been busy all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and there were also flights in some apartments.
In this sense, he added that "the need to end with impunity and to be implacable against the antisocial behavior generated in the ownership".
Yesterday, Moscows (the local Catholic police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 p.m. the police moved to Rue Montral Rue 35, after receiving the call of a neighbor who had noted that four people had accessed to the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Architects coherent to the possibility of convocation beyond the honourable
Municipal competition on 16 doors again opens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
By the mid-80s, the administration was fully supported by the Barcellona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), which has printed Collserola's promotion shows.
The brochure defined the mountain as the large park of the Metropolitan Barcelone.
She also had a comparison, in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become again, in the image of many people, the highest limit of Barcelona, the Catalonia capital is the only one that does not stand on the north-South as well as high (montagne) - low (mer).
Collserola's qualification as natural park is at the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer the Central Park, except Yellowstone, with blood skins in the role of Yogi.
This was the situation until, in September, the María called a mega-competition composed of 16 concours for all access to Collserola.
A door gets to the park idea, no doubt.
That's, or someone wants to put the doors on the field.
The question appeared alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
Concours, both in terms of his organization and on the reflection on the city is a theme of conversation of all Barcelona's architects.
It is almost a recursive theme that two members of this old election box speak when they recognize in a staircase.
And this is just one of the rare opinions about which three architects in Barcelona, university teachers, have been presented there.
Michael Roldán, Daniel Model and Marta Bayona: Concours is appropriate.
For Roldán, after cutting the literature front "It's necessary to discuss on "the front of the mountain" because the talk of Ildefons Cerda, the castle of green houses has not been held at the end.
"The most broadest park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for his great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, given the architecte for which the title of "Collserola ports" refers to a "lexical piece": it is not necessary to think about those "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Model, such as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifys the proposal as "Intelligence Defie" with "what dangers".
Pearls resulting from "the incertitude of public space projection" after the experience lived in the 1980s and were in the Forum's "cygne song".
The first fear is the delimitation of the borders on which it can be built.
"Limiting something means establishing the next step, i.e., its oversight.
"The new urbanism instruments, planning instruments, as current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] may cause real disasters."
In addition to the question, Model believes that, simply simply, the overwhelming of the Collserola Valles region "that can be heard as a park, the Barcelone, not".
Model recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patronat that "not must be lost", thanking the possibility that the María offers its corporation to participate in this project "before the first time".
He also believes that the nearness of the mountain with the city is the out-conduct that allows the architects to enter in the debate, but "double" if this technical profile should lead multidisciplinary teams ("too a success," he says) that it should be created: "We, architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona instructs that the answer to the question which gives the title of this room is complex, because the bases of the competition are missing a global vision of Collserola: "The vision has been called 16 cross-border concours - he says - in the sense of the mountain-mer, but there is no long-term reading that sees and understands the area in its whole."
This makes, at least in this case, that he had opted to participate in the 16 concurrents.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can be shocked in the program and defined with the architect of the neighbouring door architect.
In its view, yes, the matrix should ensure that the band immediately higher than the Ronda de Dalt should, in all its extension, provide a area of equipment that performs a slight transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and it will be delivered in freedom
After 72 provisional arrest days, the legal authority foundation of the Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the master of Monterrey for the proceeding initiated against him for defenced songs
After passing 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released free after the legal authority of the Casino Red granted him forgivement to the Second Penal Court of Districts, which follows a proceed to change against the brother of the Master of Monterrey.
After the event of the Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas presumed demanded him the payment of a economic quota to allow the master of Monterrey the clandestin function of the game house.
After the public condemnation, the Parquet opened a criminal prosecution against the PANist brother, and on 2 September, it was arrested and maintained in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before the Office of the Public Minister 3 of Family Crimes, it was transferred to the Detention Center 1, situated in the Old Quartet of the State capital.
It remained for 49 days when a second detention order was issued after the Public Minister has delayed the organized crimes of corruption and crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's criminal centre to have sing with a million and half weight the owners of Casino Red; but he was only a few hours in the security centre because there were threatens of death against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the procedure in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, a capture order was issued by the headquarters of the Second Penal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that, after almost two months of investigation, there were sufficient evidence to determine Jonas' guilty, such as the assignment of 1.5 million weight of the representatives of the Game Game in exchange.
This Monday, the foundation of the legal power of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, was presented by the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the region's master; so he could restore his freedom during the following hours.
During legal formalities, the official of the Public Minister attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and whose partners of the game house had been the one who had granted for forgiveness, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to the article 197/2011, the legal forgiveness of Jonas Larrazábal and afterwards will not be submitted to any complaint on the prosecution against him; no damage reparation and punishment will be requested for him.
After hearing the foundation of the legal power of the play house, at 15:50 p.m. it was ordered for Larrazabal Bretton's immediate freedom.
He moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to communicate to Jonas that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He will also communicate the order of free which the judge has issued.
The secretariat Dionisio Pérez Yacome communicates the details of the air accident in which the government secretariat, Francisco Blake and other seven people have lost their lives.
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Government's secretariat, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people, were clearly shocked directly against the earth in full structural integrity, without that the pilot could try a forced atterering.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Yacome, secretariat of Communications and Transports, mentioned that before the aircraft was collected, the pilot found that the climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the pales had contacted with the trees to 25 meters where the unit lost the shooting."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so that it complyed with the requirements required for the transport of staff.
He also said that the investigations made in the impact zone did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"When an investigation was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact has been structurally presented.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and complied with the requirements for transporting them.
The earth presented a seven- to 30 degrees of inclination.
At the time, the secretariat has assured that a priority is to have the most fast results possible; but the investigation may last a few months, it may even take one year.
At his tour, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Assistant Services, assured that the moment of the impact, the Helicoptère of the Presidential State operated in speed to cruise, and that happened on a falling soil.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruise operation at the time of imppakt," he says.
During the press conference, Pérez Yacome's holder, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual Vol:
According to the airline, the flight was carried out in accordance with the visibility of the visual flight, which implies that the equipment must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicated appropriate conditions for the decoration, and the aircraft was advanced to the DF border zone and the Mexico State had low nebulous nebulosity skins.
Selected routes:
It is likely that, because of the nervous conditions, the equipage has searched for a lower and more visibility area towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
Impact coordinates and the latest registration of the aircraft on the coincidence radar, probably before the imppakt, there was no loss of control or switch of the flight.
Dispersion of the rest of the aircraft in a reduced zone:
The information available to this day allows to suggest that the imppakt has been held on a right and latter trail.
The switch model of the rest of the aeroplane allows to suggest that helicopters have suffered from the ground in structural integrity conditions.
No fire or explosion tracks were detected:
There is no trace in the rest of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicated that the aircraft had had several contacts with the ground.
During landworks, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9000 200 feet above the average level of the sea, the earth presented a pint that was seven degrees of inclination.
Photographies show the sequence in which it is possiblely discertified during his traject.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that helicopters may have multiple effects on the ground.
After a minute research in a more wide zone than the place, around the accident, the aircraft has not found dispersed parts, which supports the presuming that the impact has occurred in structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the genius of obedience
Social insurance directs a investigation to discover the gender of obedience in the case of children and youth; this is supported by IPN experts
The Institute of Social Assurance (IMSS) announced that he directed an investigation to discover the gender of obedience in the case of children and youth, called the Genetic Protocol for Child Observer and Youth, which will enable to have overpower markers.
In a communication, the Head of the Medical Investigation University in Biochimia of the Hospital of the National Medical Center of the 20th century, Miguel Cruz López explained that there had been a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistance.
This team is supported by experts and students of third cycle of the National Health Institute (INSP) and the Investigation and Advanced Studies Centre (Cinvestav) of the National Politechnic Institute (IPN).
In the survey, it is invited to participate in the population with or not right, to submit to the participating sports units of the ISS in Mexico Valley, where the evidence to minors are made from 8:00 p.m.
He stressed that the protocol was started at the Quauhtemoc University of Sports and that from October 8th, the activity was carried out in the Sport University of Nezahualkoyolt (East Mexico).
After reaching the goal of meeting 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue to be at the University of Sport Independence (south of the Federal Division) and finally at the University of Sport Morelos (on the north of the Federal Division).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and the purpose of this investigation was to know the components and the importance of the genetics in the development of obedience and to identify in children and young mexican risk factors to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Day of the Diabetes will be celebrated on November 14, he stated that the objective is to gather three thousand children and youths between six and 14 years with the consent and monitoring of their parents for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be requested on their physical activity and their family heritage in their diseases to avoid risk factors that delay affections such as diabetes or renal insufficient.
He has detailed that all participants of anthropometric measurements (poids, size, circle of size), arterial pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (the attempt to identify the persons associated with child obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the fruit of the concern of health professionals for the expansion of weight in the case of minors.
" Health surveys 1999 and 2006 reported that in the case of boys, 77 per cent of the obedience and 47 per cent of the girls, as regards overpoids also increased, has also been observed, " the ISS specialist.
He stated that the justification for marker research is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that in the meantime, the Mexicoans have 65 per cent of Indian America's heritage, 30 per cent European and five per cent of Africans, and that condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and superpower.
He explained that generally, the genetic of obesity was not able to burn the energy exceeding consumed (calories), which is in the form of fruit.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which allows to detect whether they represent a degree of overpoid or obedience.
It even states that the presence of dark color (acanthosis) on the cow and pre-bras shows the probability of suffering metabolic altrations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and the doctors send it in writing to parents, which are explained to each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle they need to achieve to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause superpowers, obedience and other chronic affections: the sedentarism, which is lack of daily physical activity, remain the majority of the day before the television and use transport means instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high heat bringing, i.e. the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbon hydrates (tamals - meat patate to the grain of maïs flowed into swimming leaves - pain, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high content of grass and proteins and the genetic analyzed in this protocol.
The UNAM asphalate would avoid casses
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the UNAM Chemistry Faculty, develops asphaltes changed with polymers to produce a membrane with a better performance, independently of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pave was resolved, it would be no longer necessary to repair about 2000,000 casses each rain season in the Metropolitan Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Chemical Faculty (FQ) of UNAM, which ensured that if the construction and maintenance of the bituminous pavilion is adequate, the casses could be reduced or even completely eliminated.
During its conference A technological opinion on the casses, organized under the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the lab which is responsible for developing asphalts changed with polymers to produce a mixed with similar features of asfalt but with greater mechanical resistance, both with higher and lower temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of changed asphalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely warm, such as some northern cities of the country, to improve the performance, and therefore, cassis training.
He explained that asphalte, the largest part of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a larger molecule weight, called asphtenees, and molecules with a low molecule weight called malthene, which together give its visional behavior.
The viscolelastic behavior of the asphalte consists of the fact that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it is as a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C presents a almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalte becomes slow, adds it.
This means that the resistance of asphalte is not uniform in the streets and is changed during the day in accordance with environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warned.
The researcher of the FQ observed that the streets of Mexico City in their majority were covered by a flexible pavillon, consisting of six materials, including the three lasts involve asphalte.
Among the most surface shoes there is the asphalte couch, formed by small stones swimming in asfalt and compacted later.
Each of the small stones that form the skin, signal it, is swimming an asphalte.
When vehicles go through efforts, it allows the forces to provide a very well in the pavilion.
If we had the asfalt changed, these would be better promoting, thinking the chemical engineer.
On the asphalte couch, he says, it is put a latest named ruling sleeve, made in finished stone, namely, skin that is also swimming in asphalte.
As it is the kit in contact with the vehicle wheels, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalte kitchen and provide the accession on the street.
As a part of the pavilion that receives and distributes the efforts, the ruling bag requires also that it has an adequate switch and the material that it is made to be curated.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, because they are significantly affected by the performance of the asphalte kitchen.
When the soil is swimming, the water is swimming inside the skin is difficult to do that, which smells all the skins of the powder and therefore causes casses.
In the process of training of a cassis, it says, the first that is slow is the ruling film, and only later is affected by the asphalte skin, but the damage is not immediately carried out, but it is a process that should be treated to the first signs with adequate maintenance programmes.
The member of the National System of Investigators explained that the loading of vehicles is another important factor for cassis training, and therefore the switch of each pavilion should always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid the frequency training of casses.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to invest and work on the asphalte, for example, bituminous emulsions that already exist in other countries and enable casses to be resolved easierly and without having to use high temperatures.
What lacked Valle's candidate for being the new Mrs. Columbia?
Analysis of facts that Melina Ramirez Serna did not obtain the coron of Miss Columbia.
Valle receives his title 14 of Princess.
Another Valle del Cauca has remained with the desire to win Mrs. Columbia's kroon.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the fact that he was found on the podium of winners, bringing the money krone and the band that accredited it as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result of Cartagena in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico was hired with the coron and the sceptre, the sum of 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one of the legion of women of the Valle del Cauca who were found near the coron, but were declared princess, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domingguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Lake Blaque (1988), María Ever (1989), María Consuel Pinedo (1990), Isabelo Diano (1990), Rome (1993, Gracese Gardalena, Catalina, Altalina (Gartalina).
Today, the great issue that many worlds pose is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defect of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that it was all to be the new Columbia, because it was not chosen in the winning King of the Police and Best Visage Jolie of Vogue, the titles obtained by the Queens of Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who had been imported by Mrs. Columbia.
The first factor considered to be the key in the decision taken by the jury of the first princess is the fact that she has not convinced her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why?, posted by Martín Murillo Gómez from the Literarian Carretera Leamos.
This is the answer of the Valle candidate to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a form of culturalization, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The little prince" is a very deep book.
Now I read "Create and Chastiment" is a universal literature book that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Slave of Blood".
This answer has not first requested because of the term "culturation" and, secondly, to not explicitly explain how every book quoted it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result "universe and wisdom, it happens what should happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The little prince" is a great book."
Among the launched hypotheses there is that Valle has been destroyed by favoriteism.
A journalist in Bogota instructed that it was the preference, the Sessionary and the candidate who received all the pre-limian prices (gagnomy defix of Oster, the vote of the public for the best artisanal cost, and Reine Mother), "cela waved the jalousie of the other candidates, stressed the Queen, and that's why she did not brilliant on the scene."
And it was noted in his first submission in bathroom at Hilton's beach and his two delays from the coronation vessel.
Although the two challenges she had been safely safely, it was noted that she had not had the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the "Como home" program (Comme home) of the CNRC Canal stated that the fact that Melina was appointed to the princess " confirms the fact that the candidate who obtains most of the prices during the competition does not receive the king of the king."
Moreover, Vale avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has not succeeded to convince the jury on his interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Concours.
That is why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman involved in the social needs of his country.
"The only beauty is not enough in a Columbia, it must be looked beyond physical and focused on his social sensitivity, that before starting the Concours is already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also shown that Valle had sinned because of his lack of back and the fibrose that was observed in his abdomen, but it is contradicting, as specifically the jury elected it as the candidate "Oreal good" with the most healthy body, good food and physical work.
The captain of Queen Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledged that Melina had not had the best body that there was, "but his problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which actually had not been too noted for me, left his last day points."
In the meantime, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine believes that the error of the Chairman of Valle has been the surgery interventions that she had taken.
"The surgery is good, but Valle has not been able to do it.
Her body has never been herself and has lost because of this aspect."
For this price, that the National Beauty Concours was the first time, after the bathroom maillot dissolved a cruel prediction that happened last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo did to Melina to not give him the guest of the coron.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of government, not as sovereignty, not as a princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international concours by the National Concours.
However, she will pass into the story as one of the queens that, despite its slightly passage by Cartagena, did not get the coron.
So was the work of Cali's person who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Dactyloscopist from Cali has passed to the story like the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, a Cali CTI doctyloscopion came to the story as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Head of Farc: "Alfonso Cano", comparing his digital impairments.
Seven doctyloscopistes working in the CTI local offices this week was the "acceptable" tour of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who works for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in the municipalities of Choko, where many times he had to pass over five days in the forest to reach the place where the bodys should be identified.
In the year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and following appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopie, which is the study of the friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against other Alfonso Cano, we had told Eliazar to take with him habits at least for three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he went to Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected that one of them was the man who directed the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to import the map with the ten digital presss of Guillermo León Sáenz (that is true name).
But when he arrived with the survey team on the part of the body, he did not recognize it by his physical aspect, because it was very different from that he had seen in the media.
He had no barbe, he was shocked as a country of the area, without lunetts and much greater.
But the presses don't lie.
Composed by a galtonic luxury, cotton, a prelever and a landing, Eliazar compared the digital pressures of the body with the cards.
His eye did not fail it: he was "Alfonso Cano".
On the same night, the man originating in Puerto Tejada was the responsible who confirmed the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, who he was the Supreme Chief of Farc.
For the search of the printer
For a Dactyloscopist of Sijín of Cali, President Juan Manuel Santos in Eliazar González, is very significant in a press conference on "Cano" operation.
Many people didn't know our job.
Dactyloscopie is a precise science, without a mistake, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identifying the body, Dactyloscopistes support investigations for crimes such as flight and murder and confirm the identity of arrested persons.
When arrested, many criminals present false identity cards or have no documents.
We take their digital loads and search for them in the database.
The researcher said that in a flight case he had to remove a part of the wall of a house, because in this place the owner had supported his hand to make out a full coffee of helmets and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to take a digital impression, but in that case we could get the press of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in different flights," he remembers.
Employees can also escape or confirm suspicion in cases of murder.
Recently, a dead man was found with wood bottles around him.
In the course of the investigation, a parent was determined that a crime may be suspected and indeed a press on the co-incisive bottle.
Although this doesn't guarantee it's the murder, it's the place on the scene of crime.
A CTI doctyloscopic explained that the "Digital impressions of objects with chemical or physical reactions" was extracted.
When they appear, a prelevant or a band is used to prelease them.
Afterwards, the employees are sent to Asif, the decline database, or the National Civil Register.
"The problem is that there are still many colombians without paper", stated the CTI expert.
He explained that everything is not how it is shown in the CSI TV program.
As all that brilliant isn't gold, everything that it touchs is not strongly a press.
However, it may be used if the necessary comparison is achieved.
The "inspectors" deplores the authorities in New York
Hundreds of manifestants were busy in front of the Zuccotti place to camp there.
A large number of people have accessed the evacuation order and moved to a neighbouring park.
The integrants of the Wall Street movement tried this Monday to enter New York's authorities again, through a judicial order, at Manhattan's place, where they were escaped in the aube and when they tried to take up another park of the Great Pomme.
Hundreds of manifestants were shocked in front of the Zuccotti place, where they wanted to access through a judiciary order that allows the "individors" to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by employing a park more northern of the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the place, we're going to install in another place and we'll continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through peaceful seats and manifestations," said one of the "Occupy Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the "intelligence" to the evacuation of their camp was personally declared by the Master of New York, Michael Bloomberg, has arrived to the courts, where the judge Lucy Billings issued a order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the land and allowed manifesters to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, the "intelligence" were employed a new park situated in the Canal Street Confluence and the sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which units New York and New Jersey, the properties of the Trinity Church.
At least one hour they succeeded to take care of the destination, but after the police moved and stopped some manifestants, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete number, assuring Ephes that he saw some journalists who had also been missing.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who were installed in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved to support the movement members and tried to interview them in favour of the police.
In the meantime, the place Zuccotti, which is a private ownership, remains closed by waiting for the celebration of a judicial hearing planned by this Monday, during which the law of evacuation must be analyzed this morning.
Some moved manifestants took and distributed at that time copies of this judicial order and even delivered him to the agents who monitored the place, which caused 'links', reported Bray, who declared that some officials had affected the manifestants.
The judicial order prohibites the authorities to evacuate the Occupy Wall Street members or to apply laws published after the start of occupation or to prohibit the manifestants to re-access to the park with tens or other properties that they had previously used.
Madam Bloomberg said to the press that, due to this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the manifestants, which he warned that local laws did not allow them to install with teeths and sacks to sleep.
The municipal adviser personally defended the evacuation carried out at the Zuccotti place, a operation in which 200 people were arrested and decided because the manifestants 'dismissed the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it was "a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to do badly to others," because "also some stories had received threats" and the residents had feared "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation of this morning to the aube was repressing and showing that the Broomberg fund is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," adds the movement's door, which condemns the master of "not respect the freedom of expression."
The responsibilities of "Occupe Wall Street" also indicated that they do not think to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with Community organizations and trade unions to remind the two months of protest, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Vierge Mary in a Christmas special TV program
On the basis of Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will go out in the television program "It's at Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", assistant in "Baywatch", lapin in "Playboy", wives of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actor and model will be the Vierge Marie in a special program of Christmas of Canadian TV.
The CTV private television channel announced today that Anderson, on the basis of the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bubllé and other famous Canadians, will go out in the TV program "It's at Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December, which will interpret a very special Vierge Marie.
CTV has now distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the broadcasting on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her wife of that time, the band of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared like the Vierge Maria, supporting a shoe that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comédien of Indian origin, recently presented a part of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, appeared as Joseph.
Near Anderson and Peters, the CTV special program also presents the Canadian channel Bublé, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires the argent model Luisana Lopilato, which is not far from disputes.
Recently, Bublé called "put" the American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan returned after the earthquake
The GDP increases 1.5% by domestic consumption and ends at the decrease spirale of the start of mars
Since March, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, convaluating after the nuclear devastator of earth that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster of the Nippon country since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo have calculated material losses of $300,000, which, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been completed.
After three consecutive trimesters of falls, the data of the Brut Internal Product between July and September were used to definitively turn the page: the GDP has increased 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and 6 per cent in annualized rates.
This registered the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - is also the largest rythm of increase since January to March 2010.
The recovery is, in part, explained by recovery of equipment to restore land trembling areas and tsunami poster.
In fact, undertakings increased their investment by 1.1%, compared to 0.9% of the capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first recule after six months of non-interrupted growth.
However, the real stimulant of Japan's economy is only based on the key-level impulsion that invites to benefit from the crisis to consolidate or rebuilding infrastructures, to use the carences for zero crossing.
Japan was mainly waved through the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable has increased 1 per cent, resulting in increased expenditure on vehicles, travels and funding activities.
The yen stigma
Tokio went to the internal market when the yen - the nipoan currency - became one of the "refugee valverers" elected by investors who were the debt crisis in the eurozone and the predicted problems of the United States, a privacy that spends as one in the export company accounts.
With a stronger share, products are more cherished for the foreign, a serious reverse for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of the large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their low results between July and September the yen cotification.
While the markets continue their seats in the EU peripheral countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not decrease guard.
"The risks persistent, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of Thai infringements and the rapidly appreciation of yen, must be monitored," reported the State Secretariat for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the perspectives are not all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCDE) noted that most Member States had presented clearer signs of economic decline in September.
The indicator that anticipates the impact points of the global economy has relieved that the main powers are frozen.
Because it slowed four decimals up to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 per cent.
The Eurozone has even been below the average, which is at the level 100, not slowing eight decimal until 99.13 points.
Athens renew doubts
Papidimos said that adjustments will be approved, but the conservators will not sign any written commitment
With the deployed device risks and the reinstalled incertitude in the parks, Greece continues to move into the labyrinth that leads to the outcome of the European debt's great crisis.
The sense that the "consensus" of the new hellen transition government is instead imposed by Brussels requirements, as a real conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Minister, Lukas Papadimos last night reported that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of hundred days set in his appointment could be short to apply them, the leader of the New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, would like to say that he would not support the new audience measures in any case and reiterate the requirement of new elections for the date of February 19th.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the sum of October 26," said Papadimos when he opened a Parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a reliable vote for the new Executive.
A 24-programme package for the promotion of employment, the reform of the diplomatic code of officials and new measures against fiscal evasion will be the first initiative.
Nevertheless, the message of Samaras does not affirm its position: "We are able to help the transitional government, but we are not forced to do nothing more."
The conservative leader went to a further step in his powder than the EU and the FMI, the bodies that must disbloke the 8.000 million that Athens need with urgent need, and clearly said that it will not approve any letter of commitment to adjustment.
However, the European Commission, which was still irritated by the imppakt caused by the entire Referendum of Papandreu, reiterates last night that his demand is strong: it would not disbloke the aid if the new Government and leaders of the main hellen parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible".
The Road of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors would return to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements needed to pay the sixth tranch" of 8.000 million, even if there is no final date.
Greeks still have much to do.
The Queen of Sofia: "This are instruments for progress and hope"
The King emphasizes the "representative" place of Spain in respect of this type of funding
Spain "having reached a world-wide place in the role of the micro-financing."
The Queen Sofia recalled that the country has become the second donor of the planet for this instrument of cooperation, which is "essence" in the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in human being".
The Reine inaugured last night the World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the assurance that "no doubt" is "unsurely essential" that this type of operations are to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, and, in particular, "in those who have the aim of reducing half of the people who live with income under a dollar a day, which is set to the "something poverty".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the beneficiary network "in all the coins of the planet, and take this task with "responsibility", reported the Sofia Queen, who hoped that the initiatives and delivery of the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "assure the creation of new capacity and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have achieved a lot of goals and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a for the debate, but also the platform from which two basic objectives must be emphasized.
Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal was that at the end of 2015 there were 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that hundreds of the families are out of poverty in which they live now.
Inpulsion in the design of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "seeked the starting journey a few years ago by Muhammad Yunus, stressed the Queen Sofia as a "act of justice and recognition due".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "excellent idealist in the universal cause of fighting against poverty" the work she had known for 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet his prize policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in the Côte d'Ivoire Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "again each meeting I could find a continuous development", explained its Majesty, whose relationship with this project was brought to him the qualified "Head of Family" meeting in Valladolid from the "poor Bank".
Finally, the Queen of Sofia ended its intervention by encouraging people present to participate in the debate and search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is a label imperative" for all democratic states.
In that sense, she expressed that it would be an error to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, since it is a “permanent obligation”.
Jimenez considered that microcredits are “a serious and strict policy for the eradication of poverty”, and now "more than ever" governments of developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and do not allow it to be the victim of compressions.
For Spain, the microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The State Secretary for Cooperation International, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" to give "de trust" to people "excluding the doors"; and the master of Valladolid, France Javier León de la Riva, wished to welcome people present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated by the solidarity spirit".
The DDC proposes to elect the European President at the universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU) Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, a chancely chairman but also President of the Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned to the program, but was imposed in the autom, in particular to satisfy the warriors who judge the government's political too laxist in view of the Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was adopted by almost unanimity.
On 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten were abstented.
The standing Session of several minutes to which they had been right, after their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very europhile minister of Finance, did not have to be held in doubt.
The idea of happiness - and movement - is in a slogan: the response to the crisis is not less than Europe but more than Europe.
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "9 million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the lucky, "the time came from a perceived in Europe."
This could be made by amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the EU's control on the budgetary policies of the euro area, but it could also be discussed on the election of the President of the European Commission to the universal sustainability "to give a view to Europe".
This is in any case one of the proposals for the motion adopted by the Congress with the inspirer clearly is Wolfgang Schauble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Vingt-Sept agree rapidly on this revolution: Great Britain is there enemy and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the jail is put.
Similarly, delegates rejected the proposal to put the weight of each country into the European Central Bank on the basis of the weight of each economy, which would, of course, return to the weight of Germany.
Anyonexing the climate within its party, the chanceliness has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but has no longer been trying to win its congress on the two of the "pets" European countries or countries in difficulty to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the movement on Europe brings a paragraph to the importance of "Franco-Deutly friendship", Angela Merkel did not call France.
Except in crew.
Remember that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been in the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, this was one of the most humilious defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What is fraud for illness stopping?
After the allocations, UNP and the Government launched the infringement on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a family rental chain, and to announce a conversation on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistant.
And to accompany this offensive, which is part of a will to make economies in a rigory context, but is not less proclaiming axis of the presidential campaign rightly, most of them want to concentrate on the arrests of disease.
First, in a goal of budgetary economies, the Government plans to put up private employees a fourth day of care before the holding of a job stop.
Of course, without specific business agreement, a employee who is sick would lose four days of payment, so at least 15% of its monthly income.
A measure that may be able to raise anger, but that would allow to report 280 million euros, according to the Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic: imposing the officials a day of unemployed care in the case of stopping of work (they have not yet been delayed, against three days in private).
While these issues are in discussion, the majority also retains the thematics of frauds, targeting abuses related to labour stops.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will return," warned Xavier Bertrand at the RTL micro, Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, advertising effects seem a little disproportionate with the reality of fraud to work stops.
This is actually the subject of a constant and political monitoring since 2002, which have most often brought their fruits.
Francens are not more sick than otherwise in Europe.
Let us first draw on national figures.
According to the National Insurance Case (CNAM) more than EUR 237 million were delivered in 2006.
According to the Health Research and Documentation Institute, daily compensation was 5 per cent of health expenditure in 2008, with EUR 11,3 billion.
On this sum, 46 per cent were employed with maternity and labour accidents, and 54 per cent were concerned with disease arrests, or 6,2 billion euros.
So 2,5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the Frenchs met in average 14.5 working days against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting Group.
A medium that hides some disappearances: another investigation published in 2007 by the carrière management site Monster.com showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees were told that they had not taken any day of arrest.
Another study, this time of Assurance disease, indicates that in 2010, 37% of disease arrests were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% of one to three months and 11% beyond.
When they are compared with their European neighbors, French employees are not more angry than other than the job stops.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that comprehensive absence rates (for health or non-related reasons) were 10 to 11 per cent in France against 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or 16 per cent to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The illness fraud is very little towards black work.
With regard to fraud, she reaches only a low width.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 makes controls systematic about illness arrests over 45 days.
In 2008, over 1,5 million controls, the CNAM found that 13 per cent of 285.000 for short-term arrests were "injustified or too long", or 37.050 cases.
In the case of the arrests over 45 days, systematically controlled, 11% of cases were "inadequated or unjustified" to 1,2 million, or 132 000.
In total, 169,000 "injustified" cases, in several millions of employees have been arrested.
A number that represents very little face, for example, to the work of black work.
According to the Deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of lack of tax per year, or more than the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to these lasts.
Papdemous: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
This was what the first Minister, Lucas Papademos, said on Monday 14 November, adding that the hundred days given to his Union government would not be enough to carry out that task.
"To continue the economy's restructuring efforts, we need to support our European partners and a new budgetal adjustment programme", said the Governing Chief, who pronounced his first public talk in the opening of the debate on the vote of trust in the Mercedes.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the top of the euro area on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, since the participation of the country in the euro area is in game, has added.
Consequently, Mr. Papademos expected that public deficiency of the country will be reduced by "9 per cent" of the GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Law refusal of new irrespective measures
Antonis Samaras, the Chief of the Rights, gave Monday its support to the measures already adopted to try out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not join any additional audition.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the deputy of his party, the New Democracy.
It agreed with the goals of deficit and debt reduction, and combating gaspillage but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who predicted that the FMI and the EU would not disbloke the loan of eight billion euros without a written guarantee of all the parties planned to support the measures, replied that his word was sufficient and that it would not sign anything outside pressure.
The euthanasie and the assisted suicide must be legalized, said a expert committee
Canadians live in the deceit of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together in order to ensure better palliative care, and in addition to cancer.
The Canadian society lives in the denix of death.
Only 9% of Canadians accept to speak to their doctor of the conditions where they want to die and take provisions to this effect.
It is one of the conclusions of an imminent report of the Royal Society of Canada, which has participated in six experts related to different areas, including ethics, laws and doctors.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in order to enable the assisted suicide and euthanasie, when this choice is imposed, to a patient judged to take such a decision.
A recent study of the Unit Economist Intelligence Intelligence, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada has been classified in the 10th century, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people fear to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, report the experts sent by the Royal Society of Canada.
In spite of the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them are finally dead in the hospital.
In the whole country, it is Quebec that this rate is the highest, with 86 per cent of the deaths in the hospital.
As regards the delicate issue of euthanasie and the assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions against the position of the federal government, which has already said to have nothing to change the Criminal Code on Euthanasie and the Assisted Suicide.
But, according to experts, who have also revised all countries where these approaches are legally or described, there is no evidence that this description causes abuse in the application, namely the practice of euthanasie or self-assault on non-consentent persons.
On the other hand, he stated in teleconference, Jocelyn Downie, a co-signator of the report, would find more cases of these disruptions specifically in countries where euthanasia and suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasie is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadian favorable to euthanasie
Remember that 85 per cent of Canadians have already been proclaimed for the euthanasis because they believe that it would allow people to end their lives to raise their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey in 2010.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalization of euthanasie will not be to send the message that the life of old or disabled persons is less valued.
As regards people who practitioned self-assault, the sons estimated to 41 per cent that they should not be continued.
In the case of maintaining or stopping care with a patient, the situation is less clear, they say the authors of the report.
Thus, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the retrait of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be formed in the duty to respect the defence of health care at the end of the life without fear of criminal progress.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee claims that Governments, health care institutions and doctors work together in order to ensure better palliative care, and in addition to cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal sediation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it does not serve to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasie, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some health law experts have already issued reservations on the conclusions of the report of the Kingdom Society of Canada's experts.
Me Pierre Deschamps, a health specialist, has qualified the position of the report's signary experts, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasie to terminal diseases.
"It opens the door to a situation where everybody who would be fatigued from life and who had more than 18 years could ask for what he was helping to kill himself," said Me Descamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
My Descamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social tissu of the society.
Now, "in society, he says, there are balls and strikes."
The health specialist Margaret Sophiarville also expressed "a strong opposition" at the conclusions of the report, which she qualified "manfest pro-euthanasie".
Margaret Saturville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular contests the data of the report on the absence of abuses in some countries where the euthanasie and the assisted suicide are legalized or in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls President Assad to leave the power
Ladys call "complete"
Syria is more isolated
A number of Bachar al-Assad partisans showed last night before the locals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomical pressures have been intensified on the Syrian of Bachar al-Assad, which, with the support of Russia, residues and condemns a "component" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damas, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took place for a start of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call President Bachar al-Assad to "kit the power" in Syria where a 40th of civilians and members of the regime were still killed.
"If Bachar had a heartfelt interest in his country, he should leave, but it should also create the conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the king of Jordan, near Syrian countries, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, Ahmet Davidoglu, the chief of Turkish diplomacy, deplored that the Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year at the Syrian regime had failed.
"They who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and will not be satisfied with them," he stated, being allusion in Syria, a neighbouring country to which Turkey adopts a more harder line.
The United States welcomed the "reforcing the consensus against Assad and the action of the regime" after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are taking one more harder tonne towards the repression in Syria," observed Mark Toner, a parliamentary port of the department of State.
During that period, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces died in the Deya region, in the south of Syria, announced the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other civilians have lost "lors of thieves and piloting to heavy mills in Jobar" in the Homs' Assistant city, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid Mouallem estimated that the country was “to the end of the crisis”.
He also reacted very much to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damas of his work, which is, according to him, "a dangerous step".
Syria "no flying", he added, assuring that "the complexs of the odds against Syria will fail".
After his decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League now studys a "mechanism for Civil Protection" and wishes to send 500 Arab organizations of human rights, media and military observers in the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Affairs Alan Juppé also said favorable to send observers of the United Nations to help citizens to protect the regime repression which, according to him, is ill in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the Ligue is planned tomorrow in Rabat to address the implementation of the Crisis Outcome Plan decided on 2 November, including the retreat of the armed forces of the city for the contestation and release of the arrested manifestants.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Serguei Lavrov, has judged last night the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis plan, pursuant to support possible sanctions against Damas.
ITALIA
Monti requests time for markets and sacrifices in Italy
The future leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, requested a bit of time to the markets to form his team and to implement a programme, which will contain " victims" to recover the perished credibility in the past months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties last night before meeting the trade unions and the patronate.
It should establish a relatively limited office composed of external technocrats in the Parliament.
"Monti spoke of a important programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a deputy of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in entertainment after meeting the President of the designated Council.
The President of the Chamber of Deputy, Gianfranco Fini, was waiting for Mario Monti to sell a vote to Parliament to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will be concluded by the presentation by Mr. Monti of a restricted list of ministers to the Head of State, Jorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousity of the bourgeois and binding markets on their request of time.
In "democracy, there are specific deadlines" to prepare a government and its programme, it stressed, "secure that the markets will be patients and will understand."
The President's appointment was initially welcomed by the markets, but the concern was repeated in particular after an unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro area in September.
The First Minister should be a team that is particularly technocrats, even though he pointed out that it would like to include "political policies".
The new government must duration until 2013, date of the next legislation, was estimated.
According to the President of the Chamber of Members, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will obtain the confidence of the Parliament from Thursday.
Mr. Monti has been able to work on the emergency and the purpose that Italy "revenne protagonist" in Europe once he was in function.
A speaker door of the European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of budget balance in 2013, despite the recent months of austerity plans adopted, asked, including, new rigorous measures.
The "patrone of Italian patrons" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it march, also stressed the need to re-establish the economy, "for a country that has no growth cannot respect the parameters of deficit".
Mr. Monti, represented for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolized by "the challenge of serious" and "other Italy", according to the editors.
The big unknown will be the long-evity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid previous elections, since Italy must place from April 2012 for 200 billion euros of State obligations.
A Russian scientific helped the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientific, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a useful detonator with nuclear weapons, argued Monday a American NGO specialized in the nuclear risk.
The International Science and Security Institute (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from the United Nations Agency to identify this researcher.
IAEA took part last week of his "serial concerns" to a "posible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, largely powerful in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet Military Military Centre in Cheliabinsk (Oural), and had been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to establish a company that produces "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company had led to contact Iran's embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then cooperate with the Iran programme 1996-2002 before returning to Russia.
In its last report, IAEA said "weighing indications that the development by Iran" of a nuclear detonation system " had been helped by the work of a foreign expert, which was not only aware of this technique, but that, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked during the essential career of this technology within the military programme of its country of origin."
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Muslim crimes and crimes increased from about 50 per cent from 2009 to 2010, while in the same time, other racial and religious violences have slightly slow or few, according to the FBI statistics made public Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims was 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is 49 per cent of increased, against 13 per cent of the violence against Catholics, a decline of 4 per cent of Jewish offences and a global increase of 14 per cent of the crimes and religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has been lowly increased in 6 628 cases, which 47.3% motivated by different races and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is a triumph to see these crimes and crimes again increased," said the Human Rights Organization First, "the increase in the anti-musulman violence is particularly significant", added the organization in a communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hatred crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the responsibilities of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The American Government may and must do more to attack these abuses," he adds, estimating that this could be through a improvement of the police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in the federal law of the United States is a heritage of the time of the fight for citizens' rights.
This legislation was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish race violence, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual perception.
Twitter changes his platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site introduced a lunch of changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes it a little more like his service as Facebook.
A new "Activity" tab and another "name" allows you to follow more liablely, directly the activity of the other "Twittos", the internationals that follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows to know if they follow messages, if they are subscribed to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter form was tested "to a small percentage of users in August" before being distributed throughout the Sunday Network, AFP reported the Twitter port, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was known for his little instinctive function, with some somewhat soothic terms (RT to redistribute a message of someone else, #followfriday to recommend follow a other user) making the happiness of the initiatives, will also be opened to a larger public with a more comparable manner of the larger Facebook and Google+ public networks.
On the network, users discussed "tweets" on the interest of this innovation.
"It's unnecessary, invasive, and it seems too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter flux," sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Registration of a 'or' rules in the Constitution
The Government of Great Social-Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition in Austria decided to incorporate a 'good rules' in the Constitution to reduce public deficiencies and thus avoid possible degradation by the sovereign note agencies of Austria (true A).
It is the social-democratic publisher Werner Faymann who even announced this decision by a Council of Ministers, while Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the criteria of the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly under the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency was only one crane, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interests in more than each year," said the Chairman and Democratic Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus requested a summit in Brussels of the Member States of the euro area of 26 October: Heads of State and Government had then requested the registration of this end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficit and of a return to the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a same value law.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the German model, Germany, which has been the first European country to adopt such a "regule".
Since 2017, structural public deficit should be reduced every year by 0.75 per cent of the bruto domestic product (PIB) and from 2017 the structural public deficit of the Federal State should not exceed 0.35 per cent of the GDP, while regional States and communities should present balance budgets.
The goal is to go to the 2020/21 public debt under the criteria of 60% of the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen fort
Noda threatens a new intervention on the change market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Nipon authorities would be re-interviewed in the change market if yen should continue to move.
"We will be interviewed as we did last time if we notice excessive volatility" in the yen change rate, Mr. Noda in Senate explained.
Mardi, the yen was not far away from the historic levels that the Japanese authorities urged to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo has purchased yens against dollars in order to increase the value of the nipoan duty that had come to establish a new force record since 1945 faced the green ticket.
But yen has been regularly relocated since, covered by buyers of investors who consider it as a "floor refugee" in these uncertain times of global economic deterioration and detention crisis in Europe.
The dollar is passed on march under the 77 yens, and the euro is decreased under the symbolic bar of the 105 yens, near the levels that have delayed the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yens and the euro more than 160 yens.
This flambling of nipota's finishing the exports of the archipel, as it decreased the cost of Made products in Japan and reduces the value of foreign income by the Japanese firms when they are converted into national currency.
"Japan struggle to rebuilt themselves" from the seed and the tsunami of 11 March, which defeated the Tohoku region, stressed Mr. Noda who fears that this yen refination does not kill in the egg of reprise.
The third global economic power renewed with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to the rebond of exports and the consumption of households consumpted by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister found that yen's wealth was not reflected by the fundamental economics of Japan.
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called the Japanese Bank (BoJ), who opened a meeting of two days of his monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to defeat the yen.
But the Ad hoc Governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", letting the hearing that no additional monetary abbreviation was expected to march.
At its last meeting in October, the Emission Institute increased 5,000 billion yens (47 billion euros) of its Tresor's goods purchase, which was over 55,000 billion yens (519 billion euros) the fund of the amounts which it provides for the purchase of different financial titles to include the liquidity market.
Euro zone:
the rates broken, the Boures flanching
The risk of accounting for debt crisis is always mining European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new government leaders in Greece and Italy and the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the fragilized countries continue their ascension.
The European Burundies are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, and this Monday, 15 November, is a little more focusing on the negative territory.
In Paris, at 10:00, the CAC 40 lost 1,4% to 3.064 points.
The Francfort Date is 0.4% and London 0.1%.
" With the new tensions on the income of the euro area states in difficult, actions markets over the world continue to make a part of their recent profits. "
"Investors, nervous, are not just aware of the risk of contagion, " explains Terry Pratt, institutional courtier at IG Markets, referred to by the Reuters Agency.
Tokio Bourse slowed by 0.7 per cent, suffering from the renewed fears of market intervenants about the capacity of Europe to contain the debt crisis.
" Japan, as the rest of the world, has the eye of Europe and the exchanges will continue in a close round of variations so that investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilized, " said Mitsushige Akino, generating funds at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This result of concerns about the future of the euro area penalises the unique currency, which continues to decrease march.
The euro is evolving at its lowest level for a month and half.
By 10 a.m. the European fixed amount of $3570 is $0.4 per cent.
According to the short-terms, she reaffirmed that the party of the Chairman Angela Merkel, the DDC, was meeting at Monday Congress, adopted a movement, including the possibility for a country in difficult to get out of the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates over 6%
The rates of assets from Italy and Spain remain very worried.
This Monday morning, it reaches 6,85% of the Italian obligations in 10 years, the Spanish titles of the same mature 6,2%.
These trends on the interest rates of Southern countries, but also in France continue to feed the fears of intervenants.
The chief of the future Italian government Mario Monti requested time for markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened asphysics by its debt weight.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos stated that the implementation of decisions taken at the top of the euro area on 27 October would be the " main task " of his Government.
Spain is located in the market view line, while the legislative elections in the country are held on Sunday.
The rate difference ("expread") between the 10-year-old obligations of Germany and Spain reached a new higher history.
In expectation of growth rates in the euro area
Statistical costs, France has registered an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, or a little better than 0.3 per cent expected by the consumption of households.
However, Insee has revised the number of the second quarter, with a recule of 0.1% of the gross domestic product instead of a stagnation.
And it's really the fourth that worry about the most economicists.
Germany has registered a growth of 0.5 per cent in the same period.
A first estimation for the whole euro area is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has reached the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must import it on dogmes
If it is a subject that can't be treated from short-term considerations or under emotion, it's well the energy policy.
Availability and electricity costs are directly influenced on the purchase power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is sacred that an election make is the opportunity to think about such enthusiasms and the place where the nuclear is holding.
The debate will only be fructuous if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The Frenchs must based their views on objective facts, rational data.
While we're seven billion humans on the planet, "demographic evolution" will lead to a doubled demand of electricity from 2050, less to reserve a major part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, the rarelation of fossil resources should be paid to continue to produce constant electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce smooth gas emissions to combat climate deregulation, a disappeared subject from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
This is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to reject the nuclear.
This is not the case or Belgium, which submits the need to find a source of replacement that can be replaced, or Switzerland, which is just to build only centrals of the last generation.
In turn, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to continue their projects with a determination.
The United States decided, after Fukushima, to add a unit to their park by reprening the construction of an interrupted central after the incident of Trie Mile Island.
If the German model, which is on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality opposes the speech.
Berlin’s choice will be translated by renewing the electricity price, an energy dependence aggregated by the increased gas resource imported, in particular Russian, a bond of CO2 emissions affected by the construction of gas and carbon centrals.
In a few months, all of these weak effects are already feeling.
The case of Denmark is to meditate.
It is also one of the most larger carbon and gas users from the wind's intermitting champion, as well as its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Instead, thanks to the relevance of our energy policy, our neighbors obtain more than 40% of electricity than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy, the energy cost is a key factor of competitiveness and the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit the most charming electricity in Europe.
Indeed, any significant reduction in the nuclear would generate a strong increase in electricity price, which would illusory the beautiful declarations on our country's reindustrialization and the defence of the purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of Frenchs refuse to pay, as they do not demonstrate a principle opposition to this energy, analysis show it.
Let us recall that the energy policy of our country has allowed to build an industrial subsidiary of 125.000 direct jobs and 410.000 Industry jobs.
It is strongly exporting, which leads to a specialized KMU galaxy on international markets and makes them very non-localised job creators.
If France decided to get out of the nuclear, it would offer many of these SMEs by reducing as a chagrin skin of the 6 billion euros annual exports of French equipment and nuclear services.
What electricity would command a EPR designed to operate for sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
In order to solve the "energy equality, it is necessary to acknowledge that there is no source of wonderful electricity production, no longer than there is diabolic.
The development by Areva of little CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions, demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For the nuclear, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
We have a Security Authority in France that exercises an untransparent and transparent control on existing centrals such as the Flamanville chanter.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognised, are living in the same obsession of security.
In a half century the nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
One only, three Mile Islands, has been involved in normal exploitation conditions; it has remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Cchernobyl, the design of the reactor and uncarnable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident results of two natural disasters of an unforeseen wheel that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will bring the teachings of this accident, as it had done for the two previouss.
Through this scope and cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a concept that is capable of resisting such phenomenon.
While it is considered by all the electrics who want to build a central, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to the competitors of Arva and EDF, leaving their free way to avoid the leadership in the uncontrolled nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to search for the best energy score for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave the emotion, dogmes and the partisan handworks to dominate a determining debate for our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Is immigration a burden or chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized under several angles - the enforcement of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figure policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-declared status of "Human Rights" in France.
More recently, this is the administrative harceline which is the object of foreign students who have made the news, the Minister of Interior (read of 23 May) proclaiming the pass that France "no need for foreign talents, mazes and restaurant servers".
But she is only rarely analyzed under the economic angle.
It is that there is a sufficient broad consensus on this subject between the left and the right.
On the right hand, the ton was given by Jacques Chirac, who would declare in 1976 that "9,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country containing about 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, Michel Rocard explaining that France "not can welcome all the poverty of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by pools was shared on the left as right.
For both borders, immigrants are seen as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that would be damaged to immigrants.
In its programme, François Holland cantonates, indicating that the co-development will enable us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a load, a problem, may be electricly paying; but it is very economically cost-effective.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recalls in a recent work that synthetics the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptive People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a large consensus among immigrant experts on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, salary and employment in the countries receiving immigrants.
Restrict immigration to employee growth and night.
The fears for migrants are based on the idea that they may be replaced by national workers, particularly the few qualified, and exercising a low pressure on their salary.
However, experience shows that immigrants are actually much more supplementary than they are replaced by national employees, which are essentially employees in employment sectors.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow employment offer.
Positive effects on salary
As a surgery will work in a country who knows a loss of anxiists, these supplements between national and migrants make that immigrant arrivals have a positive effect on salary and employment of nationals.
John Peri thus calculated that an increase of 1% of migratory flows leads to an increase in 0.6 to 0.9% of the real long-term wages.
And without taking account of the fact that the diversity made by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (free proportion of natural immigrants among the American Nobel prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributions from social systems, at average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization considers that a immigrant who arrives in the age of 30 will provide net contributions (minor expenditure) of 150000 euros to public budgets in the whole life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the mandate, to go to search for the lack of growth points "with dents".
The dentists in question, being dissuaded by immigrants, had the exact effect of the inverse effect.
Europe has invented democracy, still thinking of European democracy
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember that, for inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, the tragédies of the Great War, totalitaryms, Holocaust, Goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonies in Greece.
Some believed that the triomphate democracy would endure its enemies to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
We know, since Napoleon the Petit, that he was here with a thought facility.
The universal demand, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and may even be "oppression instrument" as the republic philosoph Etienne Vacherot was soon said.
No, democracy requires more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarities, justice.
The European crisis we live is a economic crisis, but it is so much and first a crisis of policy and democracy.
The palinody of the true-fal-falendum Greek would have had to do so a double revelator: the need for a powerful return of the policy, but also the feeling of its imperativeness, its incompliance.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceededed.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic battle have now been moved, and that, for many of them, the Republicn soldiers have no longer been in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to require national referendums, organized in accordance with the needs and dispersed order.
A white-sein at the absolute European monarch or a sleeve in the empty of the nationalist replie: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we don't want to cut down, but a common exercise of full-left, seren and continuous, choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - no more will be known where to stop the "annumeration" - because there is only a crisis, and it is in Europe.
It's all Europe that increases the markets and notation agencies, which depends on its imputence and lack of solidarity.
It's all Europe that is humiliated on the international scene.
We are worried about sovereignty transfers to Europe - but it's all Europe who lost his sovereignty, and with each of its nations.
The urgency is to return to the popular sovereignty to the piloting of the European project.
Because it is together that the Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, to free markets and to prepare the future by investing.
The outcome of crisis will take decisions at the European level which will not be taken without a total democratic legitimacy, except surely to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle with this proposal for socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today claims the European Economic Government.
Call it.
But thinking of it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as by the citizens, would be a new foolishness and a new impact.
We must take a new stage of the European construction.
To do the Republic in France, the Republic failed to do the Republicns.
Revolution in interest could not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build an integrated Europe in the economic area.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe on the political level, a real European popular sovereignty.
To do Europe, let us do Europeans.
Puzzle cards are generalized
The world card room opens to Villepinte, near Paris, in a optimistic climate.
The 2011 year should actually increase 11% of global microprocessor card sales (bank card, phone with SIM card...) and more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart Office.
The most powerful segment is the of the technologie without contact that allows paying the transports in common or regulating its purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million cards without contact should be sold over the world, against 320 million a year ago!
Their share should continue to be progressed in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent almost 10% of the global card market (6.925 million cards).
Long-term in the Asian-Pacific region, Europe wins the field for without contact payment.
Some 26 million bank cards Visa are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminates accept it.
In France, the starts are more modest: 400,000 cards without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double mouths.
Carrefour has thus issued this year 2,5 million cards Pas MasterCard without contact.
To cross the higher speed, the banks must now be equipped with their customers.
"They large French institutions have been able to distribute systematically to their customers of banking cards equipped for without contact," reports Gérard Nebouy, Director-General Visa Europe France.
Banks test the payment by mobile
But it's just a first step towards the future payment means the mobile phone.
Many of the devices are currently equipped with NFC technology (Near Field Communication) necessary for transactions.
"They took a late."
"But they should finally know a real shore the next year."
"We tables on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in the world in 2012," Marc Bertin explains, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the fronts.
Agricultural credit announced last year the launch of a December to June near Caen test.
The iPhone of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a school that authorises the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project as Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society also said to prepare the market of a offer that allows its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is extended
Paris was concerned about links between Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb Maghreb and the Boko Haram Sect.
A long-term suspected link between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect.
Sunday, Abdelkader Messahel, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, even claimed that Alger is now "acquire certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and the reports of information services show that there is good cooperation", explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigation of two French people in Niger in January last would have been on the day of passale.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by nearby Aqmi, Antoine de Léocor and Vincent Delory had to be killed on the same day as several of their visitors during a operation launched by the French special forces.
In the outcome of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phones belonging to terrorists.
Terror axis
The analysis of the previous calls to several interlocutors based on Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are especially interested in investigators: one in a Nigerian country that has long stayed in Mayduguri, a northern town of Nigeria, Boko Haram and another to a man who is close to Aqmi and the Secte.
"It's an advanced but it must certainly wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"Mas it's possible."
"We know for years that the seventh benefits from external financial and intellectual support and that it is more active," Temple Kyle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
These "subsidy" were more clear in the evolution and speech of Boko Haram or in its operational modes, which now implies the use of mixes or explosive engines more complex and the same facture as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting by Washington, made pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities have indeed considered the group as a community of illuminated minor interests.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Mayduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Mohammed Joseph, Boko Haram - which means "west education is a sin" - offers the establishment of a Islamic emirate in the north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
It is political and requires strict respect of the chariot while his warriors involve the struggle against the imperfect Central Government.
These are first seeing churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram's warriors are particularly active, multipliing the attacks against the Commissioners.
Abuja's reaction is, like his habit, without nerves.
The army investes the city, on account of 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, alive arrest, was killed in prison.
Since the secte will radicalize and leave his fifths from the north.
In the last Christmas, she returned an attack that made 80 deaths to Jos, and then another to Abuja.
In June, it is still in Abuja that Boko Haram took it to the police security QG at a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations local seat will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would be shipping from Mauritania to Somalia by the Nigeria now concerns all security experts.
While Aqmi invested the Mali and the Niger, the Somalians of Al-Cebab opposed in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, at a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé was guarded against Boko Haram and said "to share all the information."
The world according to the Republicn candidates to the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on the help to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry revalise simplism and misconsciousness.
An African American can manage a complex world with simple, simple ideas or ideas?
The electioners could believe when listening to the Presidents of the Republic of the Republic.
Since a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied the tonitorous statements and the pleasing of foreign policy, traditionally a strong republical point.
On China, on Iran, on Israel's help, the slogans - often unfair - smoke.
Mitt Romney, the best placed at the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to visit Chinas in front of WTO and to put them into question "for the manipulation of their currency", a theme topic in a American exacerbated by the migration of the whole pans of its industry to Asia.
So if this should involve the deployment of a commercial war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador in China of Obama and only a candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, failed to face a "flate" attitude to emotions.
He called for a muscle but constructive dialogue with Pekin (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stands in the depths of the analysis, remains unaudious.
On the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military shocks on Iran if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'm gonna stop Iran, he's sweet."
"If Obama is re-selected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accused of Obama to defeat his obligations against this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best candidate, shows an unconsciousness of the files.
Recently, he called on to oppose the Chinese military threat because Pekin “to try to develop nuclear capacity” - apparently ignoring the fact that China has the military atom since 1964!
The Technical Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to shoot against Iran, said he was ready to employ the American army in Mexico against drug cards.
The appeal to torture against presumed terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also predicted by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the Republican candidate in 2008, John McCain, a large weight in foreign policy.
The opposites of the current president explain that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was a amateur and that he had to put water into his wine in the field of anti-terrorism.
They insist with reason on the failure of his naif dialogue with Iran, on the too preceding start of the "boys" of Iraq, on its strikes in Libya, and thus put it on a low label.
But the attack isn't so aggressive.
The population is very positive to Obama's national security balance, which removed Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, it is misunderstanding of military interventions leading to education.
And by argumenting that America's economically rebuilding must be rebuilt to resurrected its leadership, Obama is more fair.
North Stream, a new Russian Gas gate door in Europe
The North Stream gas, connecting the Western Europe directly to Russia, crossing the Baltic Sea, went into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian ganger, wanted to celebrate the event with eclat.
More than 500 guests with four heads of State and Government participated on the Baltic borders, between orchester and buffet final, at North Stream's inauguration, the new gas that directly links Russia to Germany under the sea.
Similarly, the German happier Angela Merkel, the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Filon and his Homolog of the Netherlands Mark Rutte, turned together the flight of the Russian gas in the Western European network.
With this new gas, 27.5 billion additional Russian gas cubes will arrive every year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1 224 km from the Saint Petersburg region in the Mecklemburg-Pomerania country.
A second tube must be completed at the end of 2012, with a view to delivering totally 55 billion meters of gas cubes, or the equivalent of all French consumption.
And there is already the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge changing has winning airs.
The project was strongly contested by Poland and the Balts countries.
North Stream is actually enabled to deliver from gas directly in Germany, avoiding any earthquake by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
In turn, these two countries lose a bit of their power: it is more difficult to pes on Russia by threatening him to close access to Western European markets.
In the strongest debate, Varsovia was not able to compare North Stream to a " new German and Soviet Covenant " in reference to the Hitler and Staline Alliance for the Employment of Poland in 1939.
That is if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting this Russian project, gained a greater security from its supply.
But it is the price of an energetic deterioration of Europe, since the project has created a slow between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has succeeded in five years to triopize its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, strongly gas consumers, and whose legislation are declined.
"This gasoduc is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new art that is organicly linked to us," confirmed François Filon by inauguring this gasoduc, showing how large gas contracts are also political and economic.
This explains the large smiles shown by Gazprom's leaders, present in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas is also a technical operator.
The submarin tube is winned in beton steel to protect it against ships' ancres.
It is on the bottom of the sea, at a medium 200 meters.
In order to build it, it was unable to avoid mines fields from the Second World War.
" One hundred had to be taken or destroyed, by caution," says Jens Muller, a speaking port of North Stream society.
It was also necessary to multiplie the measures to protect fauna and flower.
The tube is a long metal serpent, weighing like 242 Eiffel tours, which nothing stops all its length: nor valve, nor maintenance station.
A monitoring platform was planned throughout Sweden, but the responsibilities of the project were denied while the Sweden was unwanted to see a Russian State society remained permanently along their coasts.
"In the case of shooting, we stop the gas over in less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
In the case of escape, the gas content in the gas is therefore escaped in the air.
But this case is not likely to be judged by the constructors who planned to know a fleet every 100 000 years.
The monitoring of the state of gas is assured by a submarin robot, which is carried out by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a device that circle inside the gas.
In the form of a cigarette, it is introduced inside the tube, wide of a diameter, and it is put by the gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel to 3 second meters, it books specific information on the events of metal deformations.
The gas was designed to operate for 50 years without having to reduce reparation.
Gas movement is simply assured by pressure.
It's from 200 bars at the start, and from 100 to arrival.
Five companies join their forces to achieve this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the parts.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5%) and the Dutch Gasunia and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have created a common company named North Stream, to build and operate the gas.
She has its seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then lodged this company, for 20 renewable years, the totality of gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for total capacity, whether the amount of gas is actually transported", says Jens Müller.
The financing of gas construction was 30 per cent by shareholders and 70 per cent by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be reached by EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has increased 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their fees, since only Gazprom is risked.
The Baltic gas is embarrassed in Lubmin, on a pine-planned sandy littoral.
Valves, high of 4,5 meters, form the outdoor of the gas.
Senators measure the pressure, temperature and the specificities of the gas that arrive, before it be transferred to the German gas.
Since Tuesday last, this terminal receives a million meters of Russian gas cubes every hour that pass.
In full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a mark book.
There are 15 years ago by a Italian company, Moleskine wants to return the gust of writing.
He has a parfum of adventures, a few hours ago to write on the light of a boggy.
The Moleskine book is easyly recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, his elastic, his white-warm sheets, as old as the time.
However, the Moleskine book is born today... in 1997.
The Italian Mode Company, based on Milan, decides to start a design but separated record book.
Maria Sebregondi, then consulting the company, is responsible for the launching of the new product.
The book is inspringed by an old production technique, the skin mol (pape pearl) which designates a green coton used to cover bankkets for example.
This type of book was very taken by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has sent a old and forgotten object, which was a icon of the preguarded artists, up to the XX and the century," says Mary Sebregondi, who became responsible for the brand in Mode.
Success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased 26 per cent to 12.7 million shares.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3 000 books were designed.
Moleskine exceeds Italian borders and exports in 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to set a robotic portrait of the buyer, as the note book also deduced the businessman and the students.
In the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitis, open of mind and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which has 12 employees at its starts, has now been at least 100 and has two offices since 2008, and one in Milan and another in New York.
It distributes its books in the libraries, from the Fnac to the small shops of central-ville and imposed her identity.
"We followed the air of time and this new writing need, despite the e-mails' e-mails," Maria Sebregondi explains.
This cultural signature complies with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand started an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists exposed their own book.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the festival of Locarno film.
With its success and cultural will, Moleskine has differentiated its products: sacs, agendas, styles, computer woods... The brand declines on a whole range of supports.
A successful success: On Monday 2006, Mode was saved by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, today Sintegra Capital, which wrote a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the rate of unemployment of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of persons with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of persons with disabilities is open today.
Despite a voluntary public policy in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is two times higher than the average: 19 per cent, against 9 per cent for the whole population.
Awesome?
"No, emphasizes Eric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of persons with disabilities. "
" The progress made for 15 years is significant. "
" At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher. "
"But there is still much to do."
It must be said that for disabled unemployed people, obstacles remain many before accessing employment.
They are age: 37% have more than 50 years (17% in average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have bags and 2,3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very large: 53% for disabilities, 38% in average.
The same criteria that individually complies with the return to employment and which " represents the weakness of the problem " , according to Christian Grapin, the Director-General of Tremplin, a association established in 1992 to help enterprises to recruit disabled workers.
This is for goals.
It remains the non-deceit, the mentalities that evolve, certainly, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS Association Engagement for the City indicated that the questionned managers had " a low level of knowledge of disabilities " with a " overrepresentation of routine chair persons, psychological or intellectual deficiencies " .
As a result, private enterprises of more than 20 employees are still far to achieve the goal of employment of 6% of disabled employees, as set out in the Act of 1987.
The latest known figures, which are in 2008, are a ratio of 2,6%.
"We are now around 3 per cent," states Peter White, Director-General of the Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting the contributions of undertakings that do not respect this law.
The evidence is: the number of " taxed " institutions, as well as the amounts paid, reduced from 2007 to 2011, from 59000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 Legislation, which increased the contributions, created a strong pressure on business, explains Peter Blanc. "
"But this improvement also translated a real conscience, especially in the major groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of the 20-49 employees are employed with disabled workers, against 82% of employees from 100-199 employees.
"The Happiness of Happiness"
Before faced the Bleus Wednesday (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the joy they're looking for this friendly match.
We're not going to write that there was conviction between them, but the image is symbolic.
Coast coast seat on the street of the State of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have made peace well.
Five months after the shooting of his attacking against Turkey, the Belgian selectioner has only elogs to do on it.
"I am very pleased of Eden, of his progress and of the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go from the front," assure Lillois on his side.
With regard to the contrast between its performances in club and select, "It's a whole, if he is justified."
"A Lille, I'm all the year, what's not the case with Belgium."
"I need to take my brands."
Employed against Romania on Friday night for this match against France, Hazard came to Saint-Denis finally "briller".
Nevertheless, the idea of "playing".
The Bleus encouraged them since the age of seven and the victory campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supporting," he says.
Force, this is involved in increasingly strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
As far as in face, " there is Matthieu (Debooky), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he slaughtered.
"We believed all the time."
"You can play against them, it's just happiness."
With bonomy, Leekens was pleasing for the "goodness".
"Feace" to controverse a gala match.
"Feace" also to find - in quality of "vosin" - that France is "received a very high-level team" a little more than one year after Knysna's traumaism.
"Laurent White has done a work of the tonner", he was encouraging.
While Belgium lacked the next euro, the technicist would well share the aircraft with the Blue Guide... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians become great," he stressed.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll take you into account at the next matches." That against France included.
Portugal very confidence
Portugal, Paul Bento, has a lot of optimists towards Bosnie (22.00 p.m.), this Monday in Lisbon.
On the other hand, the two teams missed reality.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, in particular, a happy country. "
Paul Bento has already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt, the Selectceo, which is at the handet since September 2010, will be qualified for the euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and a rebellion, Bosnie, to shoot.
As the match went (0-0), the Tuesday in Zenica's hell, it apparently seemed that the games aren't done.
Portugal has dominated the part for more than a hour, certainly, but it was unable to mark this so precious goal, which would have emphasized it.
"It's a good result, however, that constitutes a certain risk because we have not marked a goal outside"
However, in their luminous stage of Luz in Lisbon, portugues are convinced to pass, before a public who should be there as well, even though the party clearly announces " very sweet ", ten optimistic, but lucide Bento.
"We are waiting for a very thrilling match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take the above, " said the Portugalian trainer of 42 years.
"We continue to have 50% chances to be at Euro 2012," even relatively the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The no-reported from Bosnia obliges the Portugies to mark and win.
A Null can be sufficient to the Bosnians, which they also need to mark.
"This is a good result, however, that constitutes a certain risk because we have not marked a goal outside", regrets Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has many technical qualities and has players with many individual qualitys," he added.
Like Zenica, the Portugals will have the intention to set up a maximum pressure on the Bosnian in order to not " give them the time to reflect " .
A good idea, provided to show reality, this time.
