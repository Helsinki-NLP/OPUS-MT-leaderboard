Munchen 1856: Four cards that change your view to the city
A irrelevant place where youths are to meet today.
A call capsule, where the S-Bahn tunnel is entered.
Small farmers are managing the only reason for farmers.
The oldest official map Munchens promotes slightly stories in days.
It's nervous if landscape cards are not currently.
This knows everyone who had to be shocked once, because the auto-Navi instead of a green visa showed a green visa.
The historical cards of the digital Bayern-Atlase, a offer of the geoportal Bayern of the government, are all different from the current - but therefore it is very close.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it will be clear how cities and communities have changed from the 19th century in the broadcasting area of the Muncher Merkur.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flying piece that you don't recognize as such.
In the large overview cards, more detailed cards, such as urgency cards, were prepared for cities and communities.
These resulted in details of the Bayeric Meeting Management between 1810 and 1864 and decreased the first Baierns measurement.
Your orderer: Napoleon.
The French Headman leader has established Bayern since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wished to have an overview of the country and gave Bayerns a topographic upload in order - naturally for military purposes.
Even when the French troops ended out with the peace of Luneville of 9 February 1801: There were today's neighbors who created the idea of a surrounding Bayern card.
Kurforst Max IV. Joseph continued to conduct the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" and thus the Bayeric Meeting Management.
The Puzzle for Munchen is from 1856 and is to find all other on the website of the Bayeric Landes Library.
The comparison early/day is the most impressive example of the country headquarters.
The city has expanded itself in all directions and has grown together.
A example of this is a sub-send that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was assembled 21 years after the card, so 1877, as a municipality of Munchner.
Today, the underendment is located in the middle of the city.
The households are concentrated around 1856 through the current Plingan Street named only 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the residence of the Belarus farmers against Austria 1705.
Where the West Park is today, nothing is seen as fields - at the first sight: A smaller card appears with twice lines and numbers: manually digited flow pieces from the so-called "Receivement", from which the basis tax was led.
Small parts there are no more farmers today - but small farmers of the installation "Land in Sun".
A large green surface is located north of under-endling.
The Theresians, since 1810 sight of October 1810, was in fact an east of the 19th century, and no betone desert.
On the other side of the Islam, the historical map provides a view of the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the O-Haidhausen’s homes today's homes are not only read by the road names "a guest" or by the higher "Auf the Left" - but also in large letters "Irren Statute".
Yeah, here on the outdoor street, one of the people was shocked with an idea.
There was 1858/59 the Munchner Circs-Irennanstalt "After the Aure Lüften".
Since 1872 Dr. Bernhard of Gudden led the establishment - those psychiatrists that are put into account with King Ludwigs II.
"He was continuously for his time and ended, for example, the appetite of the so-called Irren.
He also understood the staff to apply violence against the injuries," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has been employed for an exhibition with the position.
For 280 patients had been first place, then 500 places were expanded.
At any time, this capacity also did not exceed - the reason for the construction of the surrounding statue in Haar 1905.
The Islamic Amper Clinic in Munchen is one of the largest psychiatrists of Germany since 2006.
On the area of the former Auer State, youths at the Munchner Salesianum are now attended.
The site was obtained in the 1920 building complex and moved to a youth house with training.
Westernly, the football place of the TSV Munchen East, Eastern housing from the 1980s.
2015, the Child Haus "Casa Don Bosco" was established in architecture to the construction of the Irène Statue, which was destroyed in the Second World War of Bomben attacks.
The marine place was marked at 1856 as "Cuped Place", which was called "Cupinger Gasse".
The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Alliated Bombs in December 1944 were shocked in the city.
A great one remained until today at the Marien Court.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medium-year-old capelle were at the Marien Court, where the days were pre-working and on April 5, 2017 of the spatenstach for the second S-Bahn stage.
With the swimming card, the old Munchen card can compare the air image of today - and fill the shoe on the marine court.
Citizen rights group published travel warning for Missouri
The National Collection for the Promotion of Colorants has expressed a warning for physicians who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policy and the racial attacks of the State.
"The NAACCP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for African travelers, visitors and Missourians to give special attention to travels by the State, and to ensure an extraordinary care, since a number of fragile, racially based incidents in the last time and will be observed in the whole country," says the group's opinion.
A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes people more difficult to win discrimination instruments, as well as the Criminal Training Authorities of the State, which are unrelated to minorities, enable the group to give travel warning, said the NAACP.
"They have infringements of citizens' rights to pass people.
They will be guarded because of their skin colors, they're collected or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Red Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard."
It is the first warning that the organization has issued for a State in the United States.
The group quoted events such as racism against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in fragrant circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no benzine by the State and was taken in custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also pointed out a recent report of the Office of the General State Avocat of Missouri, showing that black cars in the State are more common than white.
"The recommendation is that people are conscious and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"The people have to be ready to bring a cash payment or to let the partners know that they are traveling through the State."
Missouri registered in 2015 100 hair crimes, after the latest numbers of the FBI Hass crime reporting the State in respect of the number of such infringements on the 16th rang of the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new missouri dispatch that would make it difficult to punish an undertakings for housing or employment discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the adoption of immigration laws, the local criminal persecution authorities imposed to arrest people because of immigration infringements, which would contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have implemented the action as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weidecoun project is elementary
The fisherman project Weidesaun is a successful project and will be continued in the next year.
The Deputy of the CDU, Peter White and Cordula Kovac, have set up a picture in place.
At the Court of Justice of Family Schneider, representatives of the Cdu-Original Association of the CDI met with Mr Thomas Schneider and the two deputy.
Markus Schwendemann first provided views in his business, in which he managed 55 hectares of Wiesen and 40 hectares of forests, providing 40 milk coffee and also many young people and hide in five accommodations.
The "Swarzwald milk" for him is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cube, so sweet man.
On the table of the holidays are only regional.
As it is also the BLHV President of Fisherbach, he called the weide-sized project as "elementary".
I can't shooting on such steel surfaces.
The greenland will ensure a lot of work, so many should be edited with the motor sense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," said the men.
2003 he took the oldest exploitation and managed this without chemical plant protection and dinners, even if he did not lead to bioboats.
For Master Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The community has recognised the importance of the project of the weeds and is pleased about the Leader's promotion."
Agricultors should be supported in costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.
It is hoped that the surveillance of the surfaces could still be removed for a while.
"The greatest desire we have is the people working in the agriculture and thinking about how they continue to work", stressed the Citizensman.
Agricultors are often in criticism because of the promotion
In 2013, a total of 25 parts of 11 participants were collected.
The opening surface is thus 40 hectares that should not be resorted to at least 2023.
From the total costs of 71 500 EUR, half of the Leader was promoted, one fourth was the fisherbach community.
Thus the farmers remained 12,610 euros that they had to invest in 16.2 km Weidesaun.
"The great advantage is the long-termness of the ceremonies", said Swedenmann.
Cordula Kovac stressed: "You do not make a good job without farmers and women".
Also, for Peter White, it was found: "There are the best foods produced".
Agricultural guideline (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the public promotion of weideZuns.
The target is the opening of the black wood.
The provision is the prerequisite of one of the LPR cultures.
Furthermore, the adjusting area should not be slower (advanced over 35 per cent) and should be threatened by rescue.
For the fisherbugger project 2018, the application of eight participants is currently being made with 24 parcels that want to build up about 16 miles [16 km] saun.
The opening surface corresponds to 35 hectares, calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred?
Now the white house of Trump takes the status of freedom
The most safe sign of a regime changing is when they start to attack the statues.
The Americans estimate these as well as any other - so the carefully insigned Storz Saddam Husseins on the Firdos place in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axt in a hot combat with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President to drastic restriction of legal immigration with the freedom status.
To stay fair, Miller does not take the statue itself.
A horse of boat owners and Liberty immiters would have come to him if he did it.
But he understood their importance, and in particular the importance that she has been written when the famous age of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the end of the thinking, was added to his basis.
As Miller Acosta said, "I don't want to come here to a complete story, but the state of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that lights the world.
The smell that you relate to, which was later added and not part of the original freedom state."
Miller's really right, but as he himself formulated, it's not really about history.
It is about the timely resonance of Lazarus, the only ones in which a State is invited not only some old immigrants, but the poorest doctors: "Your mood, your poor,/ your threatened mass that then seek to breathe, / the elderly disappearing from your rich coasts."
There was never a time to see the "allerable disappearance" on our screens.
Miller did not join in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Trumps were not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural counterparty: it is in fact a conflict on the importance of the United States.
Lazarus - and their friends, who used to put their words on their basis after their death - were very well known that they made a high political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing the wedding of freedom in a disadvantaged classic image show.
Lazarus changed this importance: In her mind, the woman's figure is no longer detracted - she received a voice.
And she itself has a very different name: the mother of the exilians.
The link of the smell to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a great attack on the American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the importance of the statutes, people wanted to change this for a long time.
The Great Schreihals Rush Limbaugh, a type of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that nobody invited the Freedom Station, but it's a preceding neoconservative that brings the American flag to the nightly world: "Lady Liberty is going.
It would take the section of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
The Fackel is not to light the way to the United States."
Actually, Limbaugh has been shocked here.
The importance of the Statute is a question of the position of the approval.
The great fantastic act of Lazarus came to see them as they were shocked, but hopeless people are long and often horrible travels on the boards of ships.
It's the realest meaning of seeing the world from the perspective of people, looking for refugees and an opportunity to improve their life.
Your statute speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And of course this is not the perspective that the milliars and the trumpet ever wanted to recognise.
Your seckle should not light the path, but enter the hair that is its only source of power.
World Meeting 2017: Neil Black lovers Scotia members of the team of Britain
Eilidh Doyle remembered at a time when only two shoots belonged to the team of Britain
The Service Director of the United Kingdom's Least Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-foot-scotic continent in the World Meeting Framework will "a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of swedish athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.
Black believes that "I'm going to develop something special in Scotia" and that the UK's slightthletics have to learn about it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to continue until we find it", said Black.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
The Scotch Athletes think it's something to do with what they've done.
British lightathletics: There's something to do with what they have done.
And with the guy on the road box.
Whatever the combination of the circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant."
Many of the scottic athletes are medaillen advertisers, including Laura Murir and Andrew Butchart - that will be attacked against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.
"Ellidh is quite grateful.
Your captain was unbelievable," says Black.
"A series of athletes, unlike they were shocked or where they lived or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The suffering and the real feeling that the Eulydh of course introduced were great."
The Commonwealth-Silbermedal winner, who will be at its fifth world masters at the 400-mills, says that it is "incredibly" that 16 shoots are in the British Manity.
Skotland until now was the best number of atletes at the World Meeting, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The Mediterranean flower Muir leads to this way and has established five British and two European records last year.
She will participate at the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shoot that should be observed after a great season that was able to win at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls their first world masters when the only other shoot was Lee McConnell team.
The Head of Manaties says that it is "something proud" to the fact that many of their country offices are not only part of the team, but also to the medailles and the finals.
"The special one to be the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was also a great honor, but to know that my team colleagues have voted for me and have chosen me, it makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Openly, I am very proud of all the shoes belonging to the team.
It only shows how far we came.
And they're here as ethics, athletes, who want to grow on podiums.
What about my speech as Captain?
Yeah, I think she's okay.
I just indicated that we are very happy in this situation because we have a worldwide.
So it's really important to put this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympia Stadium.
I have a second opportunity to go out there and competite, and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not use a public office if you can't handle the invasion of elections
Our country's father knew something of bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long until the newspapers struck him, from the internal policy to its political principles.
He was able to shoot at the critics, sure.
But he didn't shoot his critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "The freedom of speaking can be removed - and we will lead to the sheep like the sheep. "
This brings me to Maryland to Gouverneur Larry Hogan, who needs to work to be more than Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and removed the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their view on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union declared him because of the beginning of this week.
The ruler's stage decided the clamp as free, and the online commenter was full of an anti-reaction with "Na, and?".
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican Governant in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second approval of the 50 government of the nation.
Hogan is no reactional Hitzhead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very sent to use Facebook as the primary means to connect himself with his electors and playing his handless head to chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of persons who are on the side of the Governor is an public forum that is officially called and paid by employees who are paid with public tax Dollars is unnecessary and finally dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse defended the conduct of the Governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers or hateful people who sweet online the peitsche.
The post talked with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only true people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, a entrepreneur, and a paradise, no trolley.
They all said that their comments were respectful, remarkable and not profane.
The Pharaoh quoted the Bible in his post and called Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Legal lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not filled, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I'm not going to say that I was angry that there was no reaction to hair crimes and other current news", she wrote in the comment area of the newspaper "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take the same topic, then they will be denied by some more than such collective use and not recognized as a large group of citizens concerned."
What the guerrors called "concentred spam attack" would probably be called other "Fürsling language".
The Facebook's age makes it easy to activate a message by simply blocking a critic or removeing a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in previous times, if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical leitatics and to break or arrest demonstrates and to smile.
But exactly that happens just digital.
Hogan is not the first public officer who is criticized for his injury to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is declared by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first miles of stones in this question was late last week in Virginia.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun Council injured the First Amendment, according to the US Director James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she forbidd a choice from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gouverneur Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
At Washington’s time, the time of the accessing ports had similar effects as the Internet.
The number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800, and the anonymous writers launched its guidance.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous Trolle.
People used Pseudonymes such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belicio" and "Portius" and "Portius" write all letters in newspapers that declare Washington's decisions.
Petitions, who criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, the Trade and the Shippingship with the United Kingdom, exceeded his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project online papers.
But he didn't put her into a shock.
Speech freedom, opinion diversity and debates are based on our nation.
And true leadership means accepting this.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to be comfortable in the Renaissance Club
The former European no. 1 Ronan Rafferty is expected in the next three days on home comfort, since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian is the 25th version of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern, who led to the Arquefield Links last year to the end, before he lost Paul Eaux, is connected to the new transmission site and functions as a tourist message named the Understander and CEO's Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he reached his spirit with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great condition.
Jerry made a great job when he set this place.
He's a sweet slaughter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a wonderful creator for this course."
The English Eaux is pleased to defend a mastership for the first time, although in his 32-year-old career, both in the European Tour and in the European Challenge Tour.
"This feels very special," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because they were taken from the program in the year after I won it.
Back to this part of the world is magic.
It's a wonderful place for golf games.
Remembers from the last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a very special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday in this year, returned to action on homelands.
This event will be his first shocking event since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play home," said Orr, the man from Helensburg.
"You want to do good, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really have played it again, and I played a solid golf.
I am glad about how long it went."
With the trio on the field, Ian Woosnam and the senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six shoots on the field, the other are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entry is free, the parking costs £ 5 per car with an instant and £ 10 per car with 2 or more insects.

Reverse lungs crystal by passing search
In the past two decades, people have always died less than because of passion visits for lung cancer.
For this result, scientists of the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come in a study.
"After our estimates, we have to return to skin accidents per year 167 on passport requests", said the student Chief Heiko Becher.
In comparison, he took a study on this subject of 1994.
There have also been 400 lungs of cycling accidents for passports per year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
The household keys are very complex
The construction works in the Villing Street are in full gate and "spend some times in time," says the leader of the buildinghof Fred Heinze.
In the field of household decisions, the situation is more complicated than the fact that there is a lot to hide, which is not marked in the plans.
The transport that is always back to the construction work is a great problem for the company Stumpp's construction throp.
"The ignorance of the car drivers before red amplifiers and absorptions is already great," reports Heinze.
The road is locked and only the line buses are entitled to the driving.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp are working on the bridge for weeks.
"The warm days were very nice.
But lucky we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with quiet mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei bought the dinner, she does not use herd.
She's just using a bit rarly.
In their wood house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the unreasonable Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife normally places a sweet card named "nota" directly in the midst.
After half an hour, the thicked ring will be taken and cut off with earned, unwashed hands.
Degei is sit on the liver tree - she has no house - where she also performs their daily work, for example clothes with dry water from the nearest sum.
A egg in a soft room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wifes of her husband, she was not assigned to her field.
Poligamia is normal here.
Of course, it can be late to work: most village men are unworked and many drinking hard, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody wants to go to the village after 17.00 o'clock," she says.
It is a rare view of the daily life in the Highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was included in 1969 after a circumcised reference in Indonesia, as only 1.026 elders should vote by a public handling before the disposal instruments.
A existing movement towards the independence against the Dutch government quickly turned against the Government of Jakarta, which undertakes the control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua-Neuguineas, including the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is located as well as it is open. The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the province of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-style car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19.000 inhabitants consists of wood houses that are round by bambus clouds, and of wave snakes that have been converted by red in various yellow tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journeys here, since journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries, Mee Pago Papuans accompanied a god named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
"We were not intended to take this clothes," Degei says and spends on their lived, handed Turban, you're dark hair and their light rock.
"We had only feet on our body."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, where 28% of people live under the poverty limits and have some of the worst child mortality and alphabetization rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian Goldland.
The largest and profitable goldmine of the world, Grasberg, belonging to the McMoran Freeport from Phoenix, is only 60 miles away from Paniai, a high-land Province in the size of New Jersey with 153.000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 Freeport has decreased 3.1 billion US gold and copper.
Papua also has wood resources in value of estimated 78 billion US dollars.
However, these riches are a source of the shipment for the Papua that ensures that the Indonesian powerful militarys keep a prestigious presence.
A survey of 2005 in New York Times reported that Freeport local military and units paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer.
Papuanic demands for greater autonomie are threatened by these gold gains and are treated without grace.
According to the details of activists, more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands have been forced, tortured and arrested by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass murders in Papuas Stammesshochland in the 1970s were killed by the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Only in the region, the Indonesian police was arrested over 3,900 peaceful demonstrates last year.
"We all lose" means in a report of the Erzdiese Brisbane from 2016, in the reports on the preceding year, such as lawless instructions and torture - gesture and electricity are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal devastation of peaceful demonstrations.
"There is difficult to contain the number of victims, since every week happens incidents," said Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researchers for Human Rights Watch.
The slaves have strengthened, since Papua's resources have brought a trace of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3,5 million people in the province is Christianly 83%, but the demographic development changes, since muslim economic migrants come from the rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning counties Sell a mixed mixed gesture with ground sauce.
Local people fight to keep here.
"The migrants have started to sell hairs and vegetables on the traditional market more than the local Papua", says Abeth You, a 24-year-old paniai home who moved to work in Jayapura province head.
"It has cooked the local Papua - the mother-mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, spoke during his 2014 election campaign to reach inequality and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former roomman saved 27 of the total of 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the path to the presidential holiday in Jakarta.
But in Papua there has been little changes, and today the homes are affected.
"Our hearts are broken, because we have voted for the 2014 Jokowi, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be rebuilt", you say.
Indeed, Paniai is only two months after Jokowis involvement in October.
On December 7th, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and blood of Christmas fellowships before a castle fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers were shocked on a motor route through the darkness.
The scared kids told them that they should cut their shooters.
One of the soldiers took up their voice and later came back with four soldiers, as the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who were slaughtered slaughtered and shocked the group with their arms pillars, said victims and Witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children.
A 16-year-old child, Yulianus Jeimo, was so hard that he went to the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was placed in Brand and the things were scattered on the next day.
About 1.000 young Papua men, women and children gathered themselves on a football place before the local police station and the Military Commander Center to demand justice.
They took ceremonial jagd bowls and led the Waita Tanz - walking in the circle and an imitting bird snake of Papuas Mee Pago.
Some demonstrators began to smile stones on police and military posts.
When the stimulation was dismissed, the soldiers was sent a order through a internal brake: "If the mass are more than three times resistance, they shoot them", says a official document of TIME that has not been released to the local media.
Jeremias Kayame, 56, the chief of the Kego Koto vessel of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and requested the amount to return home.
No one was to listen to the appointment.
"When I turned around me, I was soon shooted into my left hand helmet," he said on the TIME on his pleasant wood house.
Kayame still don't know who shooted, but he says that the balls from the series of the gathered soldiers came here.
"It was over, many shoots were shooted," he added.
The domestic man Alfius Youw was taken three times, so his cousin, who was witness of the fires.
"I went to him and investigated his body to go to security that he was," said John, who only produces a name, the TIME in deep smiling.
"I saw him died, I kissed him."
The Chief of Papua Polizei, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" because they would be attacked.
"We must defend us when people are threatening to kill us", said the speaker of the Papua Policei, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistayo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrates were killed and many more damaged.
The news about the murders came only on the next day "filtered" to Jakarta.
Three weeks, Jokowi in Jayapura was a suffering talk in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims and sweared to act in historical disasters in Papua.
"I want that the case will be solved immediately, so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Minister of Security Weanto said in October 2016 that he established an extraordinary mechanism for the enforcement of historical human rights violations.
But the exits began almost immediately.
"The majority of the damages have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have forced us to act on these violations, but there are processes that must be done", he said.
Then Weanto made a departure when he spoke with TIME on June 5 and said he had no plans to establish a complainant mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "It would be legally regulated," he said.
Weanto, who accused the UNO for "criminality against humanity", who claimed that more than 1,000 victims of death in Osttimor blue independence voted in 1999, were already undertaken by 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including paniai.
The families of the Paniai officers took such oppositions with grieve incredibly incredibly.
"I was interviewed four times in the past three years, but there was no progress." John says.
"I'm crazy."
He says he's still in fear for years.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people were afraid in Paniai to discuss the incident.
He says he was shocked by the military after he helped to shoot four of the victims.
"After I entered the bodies, the army searched for me," he said.
The shoes haven't stopped.
On Monday, the Indonesian police took place on villages in Paniais Neighbourhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a building company that refused to take a man in the hospital, a person died and 17 other were blessed, including children.
The man, who was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was shocking in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Increased villagers protested before the company's location.
The police said that the villages were stones on officers who reacted by warning shoes.
But inheimics say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitar police) began to shoot the amount and killed a murder.
"We were so in panic, we've feared that it will be struck", says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was witnesses as the last ones were sent soon here, so the TIME.
"I hid me two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament called on to take account of the officials involved and to return the mobile bridge of the police from the area.
Paniai was always a disappointment for the Indonesian government.
The lack of sensitive development strengthens the inadequateness of the stamholders Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highland of Papua.
Many are closed to the "Free Papua movement" (OPM), the rebellious army, which is intended to defend the rights of Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and discovery of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top-OPM leaders were from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In the last few years, thousands of people were arrested in Paniai and have been guarded, under the "safeguardment of national sovereignty".
Some don't get up again.
Among the people in Papua is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens inadequacy.
The little trip sold in Enarotali is too expensive for domestics.
Brothers are precisely expensive of the king.
People build everything they eat, especially note and fruit and bread.
Agricultural is the task of women that can edit four or five fields of the sweet card.
They keep the majority of the rewards for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupies (75 cents).
During the time, economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new immigrants who have been opening new flight routes to Nabire airport in greater numbers.
The smaller jobs in the region are usually towards the better-educated and well-being migrants.
Papua has rarely the capital or the necessary ability to conduct its own companies competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there is no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the Chairman of the Stadium Council of Paniai.
Isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua.
Furthermore, restrictions of the international media reporting remain limited.
At the beginning of the year, the French journalists Franck Escudue and Basille Longham were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to films.
According to Phelim Kine, the director of the Asience of Human Rights Watch, the debates of the Jokowis election campaign have not been realized to reduce the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to tell Indonesia's unfortunate Eastern Provinces of Papua and Westpapua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
The lack of press control means that the international pressure to the Indonesian government remains widely limited to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuval, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widely distributed violations" in Papua, including the Paniai Swiss.
The same countries have seen the OPM historically supported.
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Arrmanatha Nasir, returned to the group's offices and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia still applies to a democratic system, and there is a free media, so it is difficult to make evidence of human rights cases."
People want to take attention to more foreign governments.
As a official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, on 4 May, visited its homes and threatened him "We want freedom", according to a source that also wanted to participate at the meeting but anonym.
Indonesia has an additional presidential election in 2019, but the Papua said that they probably will not be voted again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good hopes, but he is around the people who are involved in the Paniai Shuttle," says Gobai, chairman of the Stadium Council.
He wants to know Jokowi that the Paniai Volk, unless it lives under the permanent threat of a ruberian military, is in armed education and health services.
Gobai says that the paniai legs, such as Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a "schuld" he must return.
"You don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and threats, families of the Paniai Shusbands were a final symbolic act of the desire: the body of a victim was entered in a pledge against the police and the military station.
They know that they may never come to justice, but at least let the responsibilities forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," said Yacobus with a sweet head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire take the 'Turch' Wolkencratzer from Dubai for the second time
A fire found on Friday in one of the world’s highest residences in Dubai, with hundreds of people who lived from 337 meters to fly in 79 pounds.
It is the second burn that produces only two years through the high house, which is typically called the Torch Tower (Fackel Turm).
The building was evacuated, the injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame.
"We've sleeped and we've been riding at the fire and the cry of the people.
We walked down the floor, and it ended about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th eye," said a people who acknowledged his name as George, Reuters.
Dubais Civil Protection Authorities said that the units of fire fight against 4 p.m. local time (00 a.m. GMT) removed the fire and coaled the building.
The government said she worked at the disposal of accommodations for the person concerned.
The incident may re-examinate questions regarding the safety of materials that are used in foreign areas of higher houses throughout the world.
An investigation through the management of the Torch building after the Brand in 2015 showed that the majority of the damages from the vestition, external closure to decoration or isolation came.
In Britain the police said she believed the system of plates for isolation and clothing at the London Grenfell Turm in June could have contributed to the rapid expansion of a burn, where about 80 people died.
No Davis-Cup reform: Continue Best-of-5
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has been held with its great Davis Coup Coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting at Ho-Chi-Minh State, the revolutionary proposal for this sport was not supported by the two-driven criminality necessary.
Though they are often very long, but so also very estimated five-size-class clusters are also to be obtained to the traditional competition.
63.54% of the Member States voted for the reform, therefore, the objective of the ITF President David Haggerty was simply failed.
"We respect this decision, but we are confused that our memberships have not adopted the whole reform package for the Davids Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions", said Haggerty.
You will continue to work to improve the applications.
It is not only to vote, but also to many agreements before the proposal, the finality was to be taken into a neutral place.
New from 2018 only smaller details: so the finalists in Davids Cup and Fed Cup will have the guest right in the next year in the first round.
To reduce the costs for events, the requirements in matters of training, etc., will be facilitated and the players will be completed before the Davids Cup is less official media terms.
More than 1 of 5 US travelers bring prohibited objects to the flight, find a survey
A flight passenger survey showed that more than 20% of objects conscious or uncertainly prohibited in the control points of the US Transport Security Administration were shocked, including at least 6% of those involved in the aircraft, while they were delegatedly banned meat or other objects with Krings.
Never than 1 percent said they had been late discovered that they were irrelevantly shocked with shooting weapons, munition or spring fuel.
The survey of more than 1.000 people, which were carried out by a Jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also stated that young travelers mislead the rules.
The questionnaires that demonstrated that they have tried to flee with something prohibited by the TSA were 19.7 per cent, compared to less than 15 per cent, members of the Generation X.
The most common objects that were subject to predicted TSA agents were food and liquidities.
More than 3 per cent had been given to knowledge-based objects with Krings through security control, while 2,2 per cent of the women's claims and 3,7 per cent of the men's claims also confirmed that they had brought them to the aircraft prohibited.
The company said that it had asked travelers in the whole country to find out how many amazing smoking products had been brought through the airport security and how many of them had done it.
It is not surprising that those who were the most commonly flying persons were the most commonly carried out by the security.
However, the company emphasizes that the TSA directives are a little complicated and confused.
People are often insecure, which liquids can take, or how much of it is.
As a result, it is not surprised that the largest amount of the objects prohibited by the TSA is.
A long time the people thought that TSA could look for books as a smuggleware.
Flights are allowed on internal flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk is worth: Decades of thousands of Tesla clients Order
Elon Musk is pleased to use the huge number of preparations for its new "Model 3" Tesla.
In this way, he stated that a part of the customers have already recovered their unboundary reserve.
In addition to the always triumphal numbers of overwhelming and gigantic targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has first reported a different less brilliant number: the storms in the new market model 3.
Musk had often received in the past months with the more than 500,000 preparations for the new car which was just starting.
Now, Musk empty: from total 518.000 preserves have already been retreated 63.000.
Criticals had always stated that it was only for unboundary reservations.
In a storning, Tesla pays the 1000 euros (in the US $000 and in the United States 1,000 pounds) "reservation payment" completely.
At present 455,000 such unboundary reservations were presented in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla Chief does not believe that the stornment of up to twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of the ambitious growth goals is not at the question, but on the product page.
The last year Tesla delivered 84.000 vehicles.
2018 - all models should be collected - 500,000, 2020 a million.
The question is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are now 1800 reservations for this day.
The one who orders a "modell 3" today, first in the second half of 2018, may receive the delivery - if Tesla makes it able to run his new nagels, never in the practice without greater interruptions with maximum extraction.
Many experts doubt that it is possible.
However, if it comes to greater delays, the incompatibility of the reservations to the problem for Tesla could be.
Because then the company is not able to prevent inadequate customers to walk in the shadow of it.
EPA Chief Pruitt is able to reduce emissions because of the exemption of the rules of Obama Era
One day after he was accused of 15 States, Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Authority, took back his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama era to reduce the emissions of Smog aircraft.
Preuitt presented the change when his Agency showed the needs of the State environmental authorities to reaction speed than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint raised against his previous office in a federal vocational court.
It is a deadline that takes place on 1 October for states to keep the standards of 2015 for land neighbouring ozone.
Preuitt declared in June that he would be able to overcome a year to give his authority more time to study and to avoid the plan, "if it would take place in local decisions or delay the economic growth".
Preuitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump State lawyer of Oklahoma, was a long-term reliable enemy of strict environmental protection rules.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeated to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.
The sudden round of midnight is the recent legal detachment for the Pruitts of the regulatory Rollback Agency.
Last month, a federal training court in Washington decided that the EPA manager had exceededed its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rules of Obama Administration, the Oil and Gas companies to monitor and reduce Methanlecks' control and reduction.
In an opinion published at Middle Wednesday, Pruitt suggested that its expertise in Ozon standards simply enhance the disposal of the EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of temporary compliance of the new standards.
"After previous administrations, the EPA has often not maintained the terms for implementing and then expected to be complained by active groups and others, and in agreement to establish the term of implementation," said Pruitt, who claimed the EPA more than twenty times in its previous job.
"We do not believe a regulation by court procedures, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that there is, seriously."
However, the EPA's opinion remarked that the Pruitt will once use its "compliance to late and all other legally available full powers" to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information.
The Republicans at the Congress are at a comprehensive revision of the Ozone rules.
In the last month, an approval draft legislation intends to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years.
The measures were not yet voted in the Senate.
The New York General Advocate Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the States who declared the EPA in this week, said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The changing of the EPA - according to our cards - is an important winning for health and security of these 6.7 million New Yorkians and more than 115 million Americans that are directly affected by the Smog, which strive in their communities," Sneiderman said.
In this case, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the district of Colombia.
Bode-Ozone emerges when damages from cars, motor works, oil fingers, chemical devices and other sources in the atmosphere react on sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of previous deaths each year.
Representatives of the public health and the environmental protectionists were overwhelmed by a surprising course.
"It is unreasonable how much pressure it is needed to make this intelligent step from the responsible for the protection of the air that we take", said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to combat the ideological crossing of the Trump government, to offer themselves to environmental consumers and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrated 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 Years of the Church of St. Hilarius: The Jubileum of the Church will be invited at the Old Friedhof Areal in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 16:30 p.m. to a serenade.
The historical St. Hilarius plant is a favorite place to disobey.
Visitors of the sixth Benefiz series can condemn themselves from this powerful place.
The salvation and maintenance of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and promotors to their concerns.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique drown little."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Capelle was originally mentioned first in the Wurttemberg's original book: Graf Hermann sold "the mountain with the founded Farrkirch to Tumlingen after the Vogtei" at the Magister Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
In the original terms, on the Tumlinger mountain, there was also a dominant court where the Church or the Patronate Right was belonging to and did not turn.
So people lived there.
As shown in the description of the Oberramed Joyful City of 1858, it was also known in the suburb and the upper village that are still in the local image of Tumlingen, the "beg" of the third, the dominant seeds of the village.
Old cards from the time to the year 1600 submit these stories.
The Patronat Law consisted of the early Mediterranean ownership law.
One Lord, who built a church, and put up with a paradise, continued to escape this church and could also perish this own church.
In this regard, it was the right to use a helmet or to propose a new parameter to the Bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two clocks on the tower.
The size of the two is cut on Christmas 1673.
The newly formed lock was then the first time 1692, but later was to be issued in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year-old war (1616-1648) the window schemes were shocked and stolen the locks.
The toilet was easy.
1796, French wars were near the church.
They put the channels and church shoes out and used them as a brandholz.
The rest of the church threatened to struggle in 1809.
To 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Friedhof also served as the last place for the dead of the ears.
1823 the Friedhof was enlarged and the Hilarius Church broke.
Only the shooting was left.
In the New Year night of 1834, a storm switched the warm and half shocked.
To prevent a disaster, the tour was broken.
Only the present Turmsweek remained a Witness of the 750 years of old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Shirt Rentners" as followers of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius place.
As an event, the friends and promotors invited the Sunday 16 July to the sixth Serenade on the old Friedhof to St. Hilarius capelle.
This is established by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium's Combo and with words of Kurt Kubler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local Chairman Hartmut Romans speaks the conclusion.
The program begins at 16.30 p.m.
The entry is from 15.30 p.m.
At the end of the Serenade there is a turnover before the Friedhof.
"Have a summer bridge under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view of hows to the forest," the events show the fantastic view.
The Serenada is only in a soft weather.
The events hope that many supporters are to maintain the historical St. Hilarius plant that is important for tumors and hearers.
The friends and promotors are particularly obliged to acknowledge the home work as Serenade-organist Walter Martini confirms.
The agreement wants to examine the approval of winds
"Boisheim" does not see legal conditions for the construction and has therefore been used to the agriculture Council.
The Boisheim Agreement has requested the Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to return his approval to the establishment of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer Net.
She's been on the right side.
The Agreement argued that, at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, the Boisheimer Net could not be authorized by wind power plants, since only a wind-concentration zone was at the time of four in the city limit of Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind energy facilities are essentially possible, but the concentration zone also affects an exclusion of the wind energy use for the rest of the city.
These areas should prevent a "contamination" of the landscape.
The city Viersen had just a few days ago decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Net - but the district government of Düsseldorf was not authorized because of a formular.
"But the lack of planning conditions is the authorized authorisation decision to come back before legally and therefore also", said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim".
Current state of things: The City Council has re-established the wind concentration area in the Boisheimer Net; an approval of the district government is still excluded.
Awareness: "There is the provision of a authorisation for the establishment of wind-energy plants in this area".
The circle confirms the arrival of the request.
"The relevant writings have been introduced since last week at the circle four," said one speaker.
The circle takes it to review the matter again.
However, they are not expected that the procedure will be stopped.
In view of the current procedures in the administrative court, the circle did not want to express inconsistently the argument of the Boisheim Agreement on Thursday.
The NEW Re, a daughter company of the NEW, plants on a land on the Boisheimer Nette the construction of four to 200 meters high winds.
In the past year, the company in which the city is medium-sized has been firmed closed with the owner of about 65 hectares.
With the establishment of the four wind energy plants, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered, which corresponds to a fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re will invest around 20 million euros.
In the past summer, Quaresens City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich at Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind-energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg.
Car and Tractor Smile: Woman dies in terrible accidents

Cities and handlers plan "Heimat-Sups" weekend
Bad Langen Sales and people from the region will newly discover the shopping opportunities in the city in September.
The shopping agreement and the city management want to use the weekend on September 8, and 9 to locate the inhabitants for buying boom in the city.
As the Chairman of the Acquisition Agreement, Christian king, the "Heimat-Shops" weeks, the customers should understand what offers the city itself from the ordinary supermarket.
Planning is a market with regional providers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic enterprises should be presented with their training places.
Furthermore, the business of the city is to invite the "mitternight's shops".
The action is not only the inhabitants of the city and the neighbouring region.
In preparation, advertising was a radio, a Internet video and a pressed piece that indicated on the action weekend, so Christian king.
Cities management and business agreements cooperate with the industry and trade framework.
This is how the shopping agreement and the city are in a further stage of the project "Attractive Innenstadt".
This includes new offers such as the first "active-day" for the breakfast and sales Sunday, conversation with all customers and workers to move them to the active participation.
An attractive offers on Saturday and the vision of parking costs at this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be renewed or resolved.
This includes guests and tourists.
But also many inhabitants had lost the city when purchasing the eyes.
At the end, all should be helped to live in the city - until to avoid, the operations of the whole city and the crews.
It told King to overcome the leshargie with a network that had so widely powered.
Birgit Streich, director of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, shared the third "Heimat-Shopen" day, first five Thüring cities.
Besides Bad Langensalza, this Weimar, Sonda, Holy city and Bleicherode are the Weimar.
The day was intended to "develop a greater importance for the common well-being of our cities for the evaluation of the local trade and to strengthen its importance for the common welfare of our cities," says Streich.
The action under the IHK Federation and with many partners also clearly makes that every citizen with its purchasing behavior could affect himself directly.

Trump placed after switched transscripts of phone calls in Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the bordermauer
Transscripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post.
On 27 January, the Trump called on a telephone board with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop telling publicly that he would not pay for a planned frontier.
The President of the United States stripped him because he had publicly accompanied the wall, and reports said to him, "It's what you can't say the press."

Transscripted his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also published and enthusiasmed an encouraging exchange.
Mr. Turnbull said that a trade for the United States refugees who were swimming after Australia would be "sweet", "man" and "dumm" and that the existence of the trade provided by the Government of Obama would be like a "depp" after proposing a prohibition of residue of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump finished the call after he said to Mr Turnbull, "This is the most inappropriate call for the whole day."
Moores Ford Massaker: Activityists leading racist lynchat as a call for justice
A 1948-year Ford Mercury went through a group of observers in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and sloped on the Ford bridges of Moore.
Before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with arms came up to block his way.
The leader of the Mobs - a medium-year-old man in a nadel-streif age - took a long train on his Zigarre and checked through the wind protection chief.
The insectes were in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" burned the man.
"Have him out of the car!"
The smile strikes when a young black man was distracted from the carriage room.
Happy is this horrible scene that was played on July 22, only a idea.
But when a slinge is cut around the hals of "Roger", almost all in the public are very real audience.
Since 2005, citizen lawyers return to Moore's Ford Bridge to follow the night, where two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - from Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
Nobody was sentenced because of the murder.
"It's really unfair that in all these years no one was arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps the organization of the opinion.
"It's a shock of a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Congress Member of the Georgia State and a lifelong civil lawyer.
For him, the opinion is a dramatic call to act and makes an annual memory to the Monroe community that a injustice has never been corrected.
"We want criminal persecution, we want the end, we want sanctions, we want a condemnation, but first we need to receive justice," he said.
"We can't achieve sanction and condemnation until we get justice."
A physician shall take a bed over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI data received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding graffiti in the Lynch process were suspected.
But no one was sentenced.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights say that the double motivation for Lynch actions was always known in the whole city: policy and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens in Georgia first to give it their vote on the pre-avenue campaign in the summer.
Nearly the same time as the election, according to the information of the FBI of the black farmer Roger Malcom, a white owner, Barnett Hester, was a battle -- likely because of a woman.
Brooks said that the fat in the city was that Hester with Malcom had sleeped with Mrs Dorothy and that the baby that she took wasn't by her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison paid a prominent white owner, $600 to free Malcom from the prison, so the FBI.
He was joined by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they get away from the prison and approached the Ford Bridge of Moore, a Lynchmob rounded the car.
"Who it looks out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murder," closes a FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a compliment between the State and local criminal persecution that was not only involved in the murder, the proof was removed and the identity of the Witnesses."
Brooks form it still pregnant.
"It was a choice massaker," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this Community: "If you let register and when you vote, then you will happen here."
For a decade ago, Cassandra Greene has led the annual opinion of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Its vision is lookful, intense, and is founded in a kind of deep racism, from which many want to believe that it is no longer in America.
It's hard to look, and it's harder to look away, but Greene said that it's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynchen, because we will then be faced with that pregnancy in us all," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or you don't want to hear what I had done."
The samples for this year began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 players - a twenty-white and the rest of black - began in a room and showed that Greene began a well-designed view of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is the Greenes Co-Register.
He has played the role of the Chief Clan Member for years, but he said that the role would never be easier.
"I feel smiling because I'm not so much," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to get this story in life because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the player Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried to play their lines.
The piece starts with Malcom, who smiles the hester and threatens him, angry that he sleeped with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he's gone from my property!"
Rascona reacts the fire.
There's a break.
And then every one (at least all black players) will be shocked.
The green laughs the laughest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
I was too hard?
"No," said Greene, still awesome.
"I just don't think that white people at the time have said ".
"Doch," one of the other black showers.
"You just have to meet the hard 'R.'."
And that's exactly where the energy moves in the room, a feeling of the camera community is replaced by the inevitable.
Everyone is busy to add this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.

Max quantity works as voluntary
They work in their voluntary year equal to several places.
Where are you?
Quantity: Normally in stone floor in the furnace, once in the week, I can help in snakes here in the building bridges.
And I've already worked at school in the open day.
How are your experiences?
Number: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years now, so a late volunteer.
How is this coming?
Number: I have made abit.
And then an engineering study, let's say, successfully broken.
I realized for me that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked what you do.
Make a social year, there's a view, you can see how it is in place, in the brandpoint, maybe it's really.
What was that?
Number: I gathered great impressions.
I will start my study in the winter seat.
I'm going to do a double study, probably to make a social workshop training at the juvenile Herne in Hamm at the expert school.
Is it not uncommon, while the voluntary service has several places of use?
Quantity: Yes, it's very variable.
It's always coming to where you're doing his FSJ.
It can be made from the age home to the youth work - in all possible factors of social work.
It was very worthy with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon.
For me it was exactly the right thing I've seen.
I could recognise my own powers and see how it really works.
Other than in the construction student?
Number: After clearly, this is not about to report statistics.
You always have other people that have a very different story behind each other.
Whether a refugee, whether a young man who has been taken out of the family - must always be taken on it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have a shock?
Number: I'm not the guy for this.
It's a areas that have a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of friendship.
There are some negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson shorts more 3,000 jobs and shorts the divident to restore the business
The British Education Group Pearson said that it will reduce 3,000 jobs and shorten its inter-divided shares around 72%, since a further restructuring programme will be initiated to overcome the pressure with which the company is faced.
In addition to its previous restructuring, where 4.000 sites were already lost, the general director John Fallon announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost decreasing programme to reduce more than 300 million dollars (394 million dollars) in order to re-establish a business taken by the fast step to digital learning.
The company, who had expressed his participation in the Penuin Random House to the Bertelsmann partner in the last month, said that the view of the business year was unchanged after it had reached an increase of 1% to 2.05 billion pounds of funds in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack of Kabul: Nato-Soldat killed in self-assault attack
A suicide murder has attacked a military convoi in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a Nato soldier and blessed several other, says officers.
Five soldiers and a dolmetsher were blessed, a statement of Nato shared.
According to unreasoned local reports, three civilians died in the city of Qarabagh.
Bombering is the last act of violence that Afghanistan took this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide murderer killed two people near the Iraqi message in Kabul.
In an opinion of the Nato, the exploitation was held on Thursday when a common patrouille was attacked with the Afghan army from a "improvised spring band of persons".
The statement indicates that all lost ones are in a stable condition and are treated at the U.S. Military Hospital House on the airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO struggles near the bagram.
According to the United Nations information, at least 1.662 civil death victims in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 had been at least 20% in the capital city.
The end of July killed at least 30 people in a mainly shirt district of Kabul, a self-mortal bomb.
The Taliban said they had taken this attack.
On 31 May, a huge bomb in the city centre was killed more than 150 people with the most deadly attack of the country, since the US troops in 2001, the Taliban was cut from the power.
Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, since President Donald Trump decreased to increase the number of US troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that self-assault in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policy and in particular in the call of President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA decided to delay the Smog Rule to shipments
The American Environment Protection Authority has decided to delay a regulatory regulation of Obama's government, under which the States are bound to deal with Smog emissions, which took place a day after 15 States declared the Agency for the step.
The EPA announced the decision on midnight to be forwarded to such "Ozone Regulations 2015" and said that she said the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue with and in reacting to our State partner," said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Preuitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to measure ozone provisions, in which one part of the country's pollutant emissions should be measured to determine where the averages should be made to keep closer air quality standards - to delay one year up to October 2018.
A group of 15 major democratic States, together with the district of Colombia, was enriched on Tuesday, and said that the efforts were illegal.
The Government of President Donald Trump has tried to return to a wide palette of environmental stocks which has established the former President Barack Obama as a part of a broader agenda that, according to Trump, is to the economic growth.
However, efforts have solved the distortion of democracy and natural protection groups that are concerned about the increased impact of public health.
The EPA website says that the admission of air that Ozon contains "reduce the pression function and enhance the respiration symptoms," such as as asthma.
The Council wants the Community space
Finally, the decision was clear: two opposites decided to establish a Community space in the future of senior residence.
Before the debate, there is an important information: the purchase contract is signed for the lacking part, reports Master Bernhard Tjaden.
Although there will still be a long time until the area of the church community belongs to the community, there is no more planning obstacle to the project to vote by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area for this purpose.
One of the two investors still on the ship has offered to come to the community.
In the earthquake, he would provide a living surface around 55 square meters and a limited terrace with 70 square meters of surfaces for a special price.
The management and majority of the Community Council proposes that a Community space is not just a position to predict for the inhabitants of the senior rights residence, but to enter the community openly.
For example, the word "Strick coffee" made the round.
The decision which has already been adopted by the provision of resources for the current budget will be congratulated by possibilities of promoting.
The construction is located in the sanitation area.
The establishment of a Community space would, therefore, be reported, with 60% of 30% of promoting.
The proposal for a decision is to report to the investor that it does not want to do a button between the legs to suggest that both sattels - which is rejected to the construction of the environment, as well as pultdach - would be possible to reduce the trail height and make the building more economically.
It's not just Wilfrid Sohmer, it's the addition.
If it's helping, he's just going to happen to the brain.
It is not so simple that it is in the Community space.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many of the buildings with which you are not going to be so right, so now you're going to leave the Community space from the window, she says, "I'm doing it difficult."
Yvonne Staiger is unlikely to the Community space - however, absolutely against a common participation.
It looks for a covered subvention to any owners or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, as the acquisition of the area is not granted, but a real, doubtful contrary to market, is the contrary.
The application for the decision shall be complied with three representatives.
So there are two opposites in the original programme, which Stefan Haller is so closed: "If we take this decision, we will make a rise in order to closure a fall in our infrastructure."

FC Bayern München must reject the supercup against Borussia Dortmund on David Alaba and Thiago
The Supercup finds without him: David Alaba must leave the game against Dortmund.
With personal sorgen, the FC Bayern travels to the first game of the new season to Dortmund.
Seven professionals lack the title defender in the supercup against the pokalizeer.
At the German football register Bayern Munchen, the staff sons are increasing at Pokalsiger Borussia Dortmund before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport).
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti has to reject David Alaba in the dual with the BVB.

Furthermore, the Municipal Manuel Newers, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five pieces in the past six test games, Ancelotti was responsible for the physical condition and the lacking balance in the game of his manity.

It wasn't good last time."
The 58-year-olds believes that a increase in performance in the first official responsibilities of the season.

Turn to Stars in the round of stars
In the Harz, the first "Sternenpfad" is to be found.
This plant of the United Starwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planet road in godships - since 2003.
A "Sternepfad" comes to the need for information by many Harz consumers, said it.
He enjoys nature, science, movement and sports performance.
Members want to set up the road tables planned and inform them about stars and stars.
In a first stage to 2018, the Agreement plants "good to achieve installations at five to six places" in the top.
Inquiries come to St. Andreasberg, Brauning, Highgeise and Sieber.
The information on the tables should be complemented by Internet.
Thus, in the location selection, a good mobile reception plays a role.
Barriere freedom is also a criterion.
Afterwards the Starenpfad train is to be expanded to the train.
"After the star floor, the viewers learned a lot of knowledge, for example, about the physical of the individual stars," the Agreement stated.
Moreover, they learned why stars had different colours or why a star was stronger than another, although it was essentially quite away.
It will also be measured in which stars are located and when it is the best to see.
The Agreement has been employed since 2014 in the mountain city St. Andreasberg, the highest starwart of Northern Germany.
The location in the National Park Harz is in accordance with the information of the Federal Nature Protection Office to the six darkest regions in Germany.
Of course, from the milk roads and even the Andromeda galaxie are clearly seen with a simple eye.
In the United City since 2003, there is something similar to the planning stars - the planet journey.
Starting before the Hotel of Berghard in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our sun system, the planet journeys with its stones towards Hainberg and Starwarte - and a "Austrian" location in Demarden (Community Equalities) with the Planet Sedna.
The steel with the individual planets - including the degraded Pluto on the end point - are exactly set out in the distance and measurement of one to two billion.
The earth is cut on a ball of 6,5 millimeters of diameters, while the exactly 75 meters away from the sun misses 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet road is a good 4 km.
While the light of the sun to the Pluto needs about eight hours, footballers need a good hour to steel with Pluto.
So footballs are faster than the light in the world.
The Marsh for the next fixster would last a half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko first meet, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to insert the most slightest box camp in near future under 147 pounds, were meeting the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unexpected World Boxing Council Champion of light weight, the river went down to Lomachenko, to welcome the World Boxing Organization Super-Feder weight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by a decision on the former four-party World Meeting of Adria Broners on Saturday on the showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound list.
Garcia stripped the right hand and said, "What are you, Champion?
I want you a lot of happiness."
Lomachenko defends his strike against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 19:00 p.m.
When the couple was posted for photos, Lomachenko-Manager Egypt Climates noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I'm a marriage weight," Garcia remarked.
"I'm riding for Broner [140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get out of light weight.
And he must move on light weight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let them give it."
Lomachenko was right.
Boxes need this battle.
Climats asked whether it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound department in this year in order to agree on a date in the next summer with Garcia (37-0,30 buttonouts) also interested in fighting Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell on 23 September.
"This fight could happen in the pay-per-view mode because all fans asked to him," said Garcia later opened to fight in the network offering the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can create this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he estimates Lomachenko as "a huge fighter," and he may be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko took place at the great lob for Garcia and said he thought he was seeing the three-foot champion from Riverside very slowly. I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted to see the Ko-Aus."
Garcia said to be the focus to show the slaughter, then boxes.
Both said they could feel the moment that they built for their own fight.
"This is the fight that must be done.
No other struggle makes so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more happy to work there," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've waited at the top fighter, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four Treasured after Rifen Places
When a accident on the A7 accident, four individuals were difficult to be injured on Thursday afternoon.
After the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira has lost the control over his car at 16.30 p.m.
The Pkw slowed right into the shooting, where he was overwhelming and then remained on the toilet in the green strike.
The four injuries - two adults and two children - were very difficult in the accident.
During the first insurance of losers through the rescue service, the A7 was cut into Northern direction for about one hour, then the transport was able to be transferred to the left drivers to the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Direct works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that after the 2:2 season at the stage infringement against braunschweak that the optimization of the shooting training in Aue points.
With the first stage game, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result, the two opposers were not there at 2:2.
"The two opposites were too much, and we need to look better in Aue," said the decree player of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
The three chain should also be optimized in the shipping area.
And a door after a free chair does not want to get the fortunes anymore.
"For the future, no more will be put on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his manity is better justified after the experiences in the preparation with the three chain than with the fourth chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to work in Aue," said his train Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is safe to his matter, "for we just have in the three chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann, who can build well", said Hoffmann.
"It's prevaluation, but that we're still better harmonizing, and we're not in the construction of so many game errors."
Of course Hoffmann also runs to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk after an indecision of a misleading start, you don't know.
The performance could be really good", said Hoffmann.
"But when we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the pokal, we'll probably be able to talk about an ordinary season."
Dovon wanted to know anything about his trainer.
"The start in the season I just judge after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not want to speak from an advantage to the ear, just because the game of the Sachsen in Himalayan home was to be interrupted because of an unvehicle.
"The last time they can start the season with almost a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, "that the players of Aue may even be something more fresh, because they couldn't have a hard and complete game like Fortuna against a snake of skins.
"But they don't know so much 100 percent where they are now," says the Internal Protector of Fortuna.
Even though guests from Rheinland are as a light fashion on Sunday in the final (approximately) stadium of Aue.
"What we get them away, only because we have the right to come under the first six, it's a blonde sense," says the Funkel, whose balance is positive in only a shooting place against ear from nine games.
"There is no manage in the 2th Federal Liga that you have to shoot from before," says Fortunas Chefcoach.
"It would be arrogant and overwhelming."
And so Funkel wants to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum evaluation tests
The recent results of tests for asylum demanders in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method for the medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80% of the tested persons are older than 18 years of age. But not everyone believes the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Medical Authority for Forensic Medicinal Medicine (Rapporteur) has started testing in the past year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make assessment of the age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrations) because of errors in the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees who were less age.
To this day, migration shop has sent 6.880 cases to test, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from the midst of March to 31 July 2017.
Eight per cent (2002) was estimated as 18 or older, while in other 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency estimated that the person may be 18 or older.
In 432 cases, the conclusion that the person was "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests shall be performed only in cases where the age of the person is subject to question.
According to the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are responsible for the last months.
"We do not see a great difference in the statistics of the last months, the numbers are very consistent," he said the magazine The Local.
The high part of cases in which the person has been judged as over 18 years does not mean that the asylum applicant has lied over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "proposed that the investigated person was 18 years or older."
When the Svenska Dagbladet studied the 581 results published, she noted that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that it would be 18 years old in this year.
The methods of medical age evaluation, which are made in the rings of skins and MRT sights, which then were analyzed by dentists and radiologs, have also been criticized in some areas.
A skepticist is the endocrinolog Claude Marcus of the Carolinska Institute, whose work includes the evaluation of the biological rif of people to see whether they went before or later by the puberty.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think that the type of measurement should be used.
The biological age in this way is very insecure.
If we can't say it sure, we should not do as if we could," he said the newspaper metro.
The Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "It is generally possible to say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low.
The largest risk is, if the person is just under 18, in this case, about 10%."
Full in the plan
The work on the three bridges of the Land Street 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are well forwarded.
On midnight a seven tons of seven tonnes was installed at the bridge at the east of Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it spends over," says Reinhold Leicht, head of the road office and transport at the government presidency of Freeburg.
In April, the work began at all three sanctions bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building is planned for October and it is easy to ensure that the timeplan is maintained.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads through the Trombach.
It is a wooden stone bridge from Beton, which is shipped with red buntsandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
She was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, she has been in the middle of the years.
In order to ensure the stability and transport security, the three buildings are now well sanized.
The other two bridges lead through the lauterbach.
They are built out of red buntsandstein.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, relatively 10.60 meters long.
Lauterbach's bridge at the local seminar of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 m width and seven tonnes of a severe bridge head called.
This is a random test that is also used as an operational route.
On the south of the bridge, a width of 2,20 meters of the bridge should be used on Friday.
That's where the footsteps are going to go.
This is particularly the case of the final parts, a patent of the Schramberger Company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already covered with the patented bridge caps.
Especially thicking feeling has required the injury of leads through the construction work in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass facility that is connected to many companies.
The people were informed in the case of the works by handbook on the project.
Furthermore, fish and cancer should first be dismissed.
For the bridges between the building building and the gateway in direction Schramberg, the transport is insecurely regulated by a camp.
For the construction work at the bridge at the Lauterbacher localseingang, the road in the bridge is fully hidden by the "Taninerhof" hotels and "Seven Linden" hotels.
The costs for the three bridge savings are assembled by 700 000 euros.
Financed the whole country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German kartoffelsalat
It is not so often that the parties go to a strand, but when it goes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is only difficult to bring them under a hair.

The police has managed many officers to Gerolstein, especially on the train station, which is just a few meters away from the events.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported by the AfD Vulcan fleet, he has tried to have such an event and get the appeal.
The 45-year-old age from the Dunners village had first been asked in Daun, but there was a depth because there were no enough parking places because of the already built laurity kids.
Now the Rondell, Hompes, is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here."

In the room, some 200 listeners waited for the sight candidate for the Federal Day, Alice Weidel, and the Chairman of the Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch keep their talks.
The police's presence is unchanged, but the officers had a peaceful night.
Some more than one hour is the AMD event that guests on the floor have a longer breath, but there is also a short after 21.00 p.m.
The police can cut off - no special responsibilities.

After their separation, Christians became almost exemplary: "I have always lived the dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never been confused or disappointed.
I just never wanted to be taken seriously."
In particular, she suffered "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she liked to clothe as a bub: "There aren't all girls typical girls.
That really hurted me.
When I was 11 years old, the children told me, I would look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, disappointed, disappointed.
Now I look back and think, "Mama, be proud of you!"

The Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
. The Democratic Governeur of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced the Sunday at a meeting with President Trump that he will change the party.

Justice, who is in the state of the only billions, was chosen in 2016.
Forbes states that he has carbonization in five countries, and his father has produced a coal business.
He's $1,59 billion.
In the interim period, the Republican National Committee held a statement on Thursday, which said: "The party's exchange of government justice is a further failure for a democratic party, which would prevent us more than work to make our country great again."
"For only 15 Governments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the proclamation of Gouverneur Justice is only the last refusal of a party, which is from the top to the bottom and is not able to find a positive message," the RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe honors "real" Russian apology for Doping Scandal
The world head of the lightthletics, Sebastian Coe, loving on Thursday, which he described as an outstanding apology from Russia to a Doping Scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included again in the sport.
Russian Lechtathletic Chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF World Meeting at the end of the IAAF World Meeting that the provision of his country was corrected from the sport and that he decided to fight the doping.
He said it's sorry for "to all athletes who were cut off with gold and silver medals in competitives".
Despite his comments, the IAAF compromise for the conservation of the prohibition that was linked in November 2015, after a report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) showed that the Doping Doping was publicly supported in Russia was found.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said the President of IAAF Coe to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were glad that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that she has experienced some very warm times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is restructured."
Coe said he was also "rejoiced" of accepting Russia's criteria for his re-introduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been achieved, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to restore Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything in the next months to normalize this situation.
The principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the deceited system," he added.
Nineth Russian athletes will be held at the Lightthletic World Meetings, which started on Friday in London, following the strict IAAF criteria as neutral actors.
The leader of the IAAF-Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia should comply with some of the criteria for reconstruction.
Drug tests were still inadequate and prohibited trainers are still free, he said reporters in London after a talk to the IAAF Council.
Trauring for distorted soldiers in Mali
At a celebration in the northeastern Fritzler, about 1,000 people thought about the two of the soldiers who were killed in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Sunday city under high security arrangements.
For the still unexpected absturgence cause, the Defence Minister Ursula said nothing from the Leien (CDU).
She called the two converted pilots, but "the King of their Fachs."
"We destroyed us before this higher sacrifice they brought on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Stabshaptmann and the 47-year-old stab-hauptman from North Hesse were living around a week ago in the West African Mali.
They were transferred to Germany and joined on Thursday by a federal wave watch to the Fritzler Dom Sankt Peter.
On midday, only the members of the church were adopted.
Then the celebration of the family, the closest friends, the representatives of the federal law and the policy began.
In addition, Hessens, Minister of Ministers of Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Federal Inspector-General of Volker Wieker, were also President.
The most tragics left Roses down, the family stood arm in arm to the snares.
Before the church, Fritzlers and many soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a shift.
The Defence Minister of Leyens called the converted soldiers as "high decorated" and employees.
The Stab Shauptmann has been built with a fretzler aircraft and was one of the first six Tiger pilots trained in his regime.
Also, Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regime, which belongs to the soldiers, declared: "If this displacement couldn't defeat the absorption, then no one would have embraced".
The Minister not showed doubts at the UN Mission in Mali: the use is dangerous.
But he also is of high importance "for a country we are separated by only two countries," she said.
After the celebration, the shoes were taken out of the dom.
When and where they were allocated, the federal authorities did not make any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grabe next to his wife.
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), will not be ruled next to his wife.
This was the king's house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish king couple is used in the Domkirch of Roskilde.
The Bjørn Nørgaard image has already done a sarcophag for the two.
The Queen is agreed with the decision of her husband, and it continued to be called in the communication.
Where the Prince Henrik will be buried, you're still unclean.
But he did not intend to be implemented in his French home.
Prince Henrik never made a illness that he wasn't happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would like to become king.
He went to the calm 2016 and also deleted the title "Prince Meal".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function that he wanted, he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after the death, Lene Balleby explained the chief speaker of the Danish King's house.
Where the last place of the 83-year-old is going to be unexpected.
But he has not intended to be introduced in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he worked for the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French adelant sex, had learned Margreth 1965 in London.
He worked in the French message.
During his later wife, the sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a serious position in his 50-year-old government in Denmark.
In an autobiography Henrik expressed the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was hampered, I prefered wine instead of beer, strick-sockets instead of strikes, citroens instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the gauloises that I was smoking instead of Virginia-Tabak and who had the call here to be the Mark of Social Critical Intelligence, I couldn't hope to be overlooked.
I was different.
I seem to be satisfied with this position and not to worry me.
They were just two errors!"
President-President because he will rapidly choose newly
CDU and FDP before possible majority in niedresaches
Niedersachsen, President Stephan Weil (SPD) after the loss of the Red-Green Government's rule for a rapid new choice of the landscape, he does not want to come back.
Because on Friday, the Parliament's resolution was declared.
Before the surprising outcome of a green Member of the Niedersachsen Group, the Government of Ministers Stephan Weil (SPD) had been a serious crisis.
Five months before the official end of the Sunday's election, the red green coalition in Hannover has lost its nice one-size master in Parliament to the opposition of CDU and FDP.
The previous Green Deputy Elke Twesten founded its step with the non-nomination of the election 2018 in its election circle in Rotenburg (Women).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CD-Fraktion Chief Björn Thumler wants to recommend its group to include it.
For this reason, the CDU and FDP had 69 seats together in the Netherlands Landscape, SPD and Green 68 seats.
The relationship was changing.
The new Saturday is regularly selected on 14 January.
Thumler said that the Red-Green Land government should now decide whether they could continue to register in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan because it is unnecessary that the Sunday may soon decide its self-resolution.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on Tuesday on its further action.
The Constitution also proposes the possibility of the Sunday of the President of the Ministers to deal with confidence and a follower.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These opportunities must be examined legally clean", said Thumler.
"All questions will be discussed in calm, if they are legally examined."
"Twesten's Step" at the soil and "fighting somewhat curiosity".
The politician himself stressed: "I'm not a trailer.
I feel very good."
She was a member of Black Green.
The Greens requested the abstracted Members to return their landscape mandate.
"We are self-reaching that she has received her country officer, which she has received over the green country list, return with immediate effect," the President Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Korner shared.
The President of the Green Group Anja Piel said, "We regret the decision of Elke Twesten outstanding."
They have decided to conduct no debate in the Group.
"After the background, that there were no content differences, we can't meet this step."
SPD Candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the neighbouring Green Deputy Elke Twesten to CDU as a deputy.
"The behaviour of the former Green Members in Niedersachsen is not only the torment of the elections and elections, but also the disputation of the Red Green," wrote the Federal Head of Social Democratics on Friday on Facebook.
He supported the decision of President Stephan Weil (SPD) to make it possible to re-elect the Sunday.
The outcome of Twest costs the majority of red greens in Niedersachsen.
The politicians "in their illness and their own interests in the well-being of the country" criticized the SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It's a scandal that the CDU in Niedersachsen has this smiling intrigence game and tries to shoot political capital."
Niedersachsens CD-Fraktion Chief Björn Thumler will recommend its deputy to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD head of the Federal Day, Thomas Oppermann, proposed Twesters to false the outcome of the 2013 Sunday election.
The CDU was at the time before the SPD's most stronger force, but SPD and Green had a huge majority of a voice.
Minister for Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect us from guests, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses indeed eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How to protect consumers.
The Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is interviewed with the editor Networks Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect its eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to see eggs in your fridge and to check the temperature pressure.
The Consumer Protectionport www.living Warning.de the Federal States shall enter the most recent information on the oil chargen concerned.
These eggs should be destroyed or deleted.
Even if, after all that we are now knowing, a health risk is practically excluded.
Now, Aldi takes the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Deputy Minister of Agriculture is not realized?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal countries.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately been shocked and has been closely exchanged with the authorities of the country since the complaints of the interest in Germany have been acknowledged.
All information and risk assessments are available for consumers.
The trade has to ensure that the sales products are insecurable and healthy, as well as the manufacturers.
If eggs are exceededed from 0,005mg/kg, they are not moveable.
Nevertheless, eggs can be sold and depleted.
This time the operations are not guilty.
Set production companies and consumers in the same boat?
After the current recognition, the production industry does not have an immediate debt.
Moreover, they must, due to illegal practices of service companies with economic damage.
As always, there are too little control colors.
Does it lack personally or even the final responsibility?
It was just the official controls that discovered the process.
However, it is also true that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 per cent.
This is why it is vital that such events and transmission to State authorities in cases where crimes can be undertaken.
I have already cleared that I was waiting for an unfair statement by the responsible authorities.
Is it really necessary for regular alarm in food channels?
Consumers and consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
If a non-accepted insection in the food economy is used, consumers and consumers are entitled to the right.
The funds used are made by manufacturers, handlers and consumers in a situation that is not absolutely necessary.
In fact, it must be clear: the right-wide use of the insect fipronil in the situation of living animals is not suitable and must be completed immediately.
This is necessary to be worked with high pressure at all levels.
I hope that all competent authorities will be declared slightly and slowly cleared.
How the financial rules of football are affected to Neymar's shopping to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unforeseen expenditure of the European football unit will not defeat Neymars World Record Transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris St. Germain.
Any consequences for Paris Saint-Germain are still coming from the EUFA, since the leading organization that has observed the European game has the power to prohibit the access to the prestigious League tourist.
Financial Fair Play Rules, called by the EUFA in 2011, means that PSG must at once prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without great loss.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million (262 million) to purchase the Brazilians from its contract, and Neymar will receive a content that will be covered by several ten million dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's trade to France.
PSG can with security make the money locker to sign Neymar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team through the rich dominant family of Katar.
Bloods may use a lot of money for the purchase of players, but with legitimate sources of income to taxes that will allow them to make the Break edge point in their football business.
FFP has been designed by Michel Platini after his choice to EUFA Chairpersons in 2007.
The former French players believed that Vereine, who had taken great debts in their efforts, had effectively tried and risked to destroy themselves when banks or owners returned their support.
In 2011, the FFP reduced the debt of the club to monitor their losses.
The change means that the business model used the Roman Abramouk originally in Chelsea in 2003 - buyed a club with potential and then intensely invested to improve the manity and to build a global mark - should be a worse matter.
During the current three-year FFP event period, which runs until 2018, clubs can increase losses of EUR 30 million.
Although the 2015 Presidency has fallen in Hungary, his EUFA follower Aleksander Ceferin continues to reduce excessive expenditure.
"Verily FFP is not dead and we will still strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, responsible for EUFA for FFP, against The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clauses of Neymar in a pauschale, it may distribute the amount for the accounting period of its contract.
Neymar has signed a fifth year contract, so that the exemption sums for the next five years may be issued in the annual end of 44.4 million euros.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has taken the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is in the possession of Manchester City, with the most serious sanctions.
The PSG has received a currency of 60 million euros (when 82 million dollars), which later was collected to 20 million euros, and was ordered that the members of the Manages' Champions League of the season 2014/15 remained limited to 21 players instead of the other normal 25 players.
The EUFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlook their financial oversight by stopping its revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a catalyst company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, EUFA would not apply this as a legitimate income.
As in 2014, the EUFA decided that the value of the Sponsoring PSA was disabled by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that a part of the PSG reports to Neymar could come to catalogue on payments of the WM 2022 Organization Committee.
But PSG and catalogue 2022 have claimed that Neymar WM's managers will become and that such a manner for EUFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find.
The previous sanctions against the PSG means that the EUFA will be more attentioned to consider any attempt to implement the rules.
The EUFA did not have prepared discussion with PSG on Neymar's transfer, and on Thursday, he said people who are trusted in the situation.
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not able to discuss the PSG situation.
The last reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of EUR 542,4 million.
The accounts for the last business year need to be published.
PSG expects that Neymar's arrival is a blessing for Sponsoring Deals, Merchandising and Tricot sales.
The Agreement is deeming to increase at least 30 per cent after the signing.
The Spanish liga was obviously irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's way by saying that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish newspaper AS regarding the last ownership of catardia at PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose agreement is an American sport type, shares the preserves of La Liga against a State that finances an agreement.
"It is the consequence of the property and it has completely changed the entire landscape of the football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When a country has an agreement, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial Fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country."
Swiss is on the search for a new shoggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey Border Schokolade has produced for Swiss.
The Swedish cooperation is now before possible ends: the aircraft writes the task again.
Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed the request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the "Nordwestschweiz" newspaper from Friday.
As the current planning, the airline will be deleted by a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked between two and three years and understood by quality control.
"In the present provider Chocolat Frey, we are very satisfied," said the speaker.
Rund 17 million small redwise packed shog tables to 14 grams per year distribute the aircraft members before loading to the passengers.
With regard to the costs, Swiss did not want to inform.
Inspectors estimate the term "Nordwestern Swiss" at 1.5 to 2 million Frances - the Migros girls have a year sum of around a million of France.
However, more important is the public effect: for a shogy producer, it is a prestigious task.
How many applicants there are in the new registration, the Swiss does not want to be tragic.
But only Swiss manufacturer will come in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to work further to renew the contract on spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Schokolade tables are distributed by the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights.
Before Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had provided the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo led Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airport company works together with various Swiss shock producers.
On long-term flights, customers of the First Class are cut off by the Confiserie Springli, in the business class, following passenger shoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
Swiss also shares shoggi of Chocolat Frey, both in business and in the Economy Class.
Lightthletics - Discuss-Olympiasizer Robert Harting reached WM-Finale
The three-year world master fights on Saturday at the end of the end on a medaille.
His brother Christoph, the Olympiasier of 2016, was in the WM's National Deputy and was able to look at the controversial campaign only from the tribune.
At the same time, with the first attempt, the Polish defender Piotr Malachowski, the 65.13 meters long, was qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgie goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the Nice
This repeating of the story is simultaneously the glorious days of the 80s, for the 90s-year-old age (as the predictor David Wein and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch Communities for MTV), and it is for himself, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd.
As cultural artefact, it is equally a parodie and a confusion of our Facebook-able era permanent memorys.
But as Franchise, it feels like the time would be right.
"First Day of Camp" worked well, not only because of his absurd humors (a original history for a talking double meals, spoke by H. Jon Benjamin).
When they seen on the corner of the Gag - sculpters play medium-year-old children who are grown - but they created the unable to win the last part of the witz.
"The Years Later" with adults who are now playing adults is less emotively, and his parodie goes more according to the principle of gyzing, including a riff on the scalker film of the 1990s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that looks at the rows").
On one point, a character is cut by a Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central historys are the same.
The lovely coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has not yet forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his youth.
And there's another crazy-boss plot, which is included in the Ronald Reagan (such as Mr. Showalter), which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
How always the excursions are the best part of Franchise.
It's particularly fun to see the everlasting young Mr. Rudd, Matt Dillons underlying bart of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old skin.
It's the moments of angry that could emphasize this Franchise as a kind of repeating "Seven Up" series, until he reached what I am as his logical conclusion: "What Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scenes will show the bands how it will visit the film premiers of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon remembers another kind of nostalgie: the renewal of the cold war of "The Americans", on the film "Atomic Blonde" and even the "GLOW" with its East-West-West Ringbox icon.
The commodities created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka have been a government for a TV series found: a Romanian drama of the twenty-first years with both police officers as friends, two officers from Bucarest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of marxism.
The main roles - a hard-speaked Gregor and a idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatuum (e.g. a exporter) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt on English.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much more than a idea.
There are some beautiful games to look (the police slows the time to look at the television, how Americans may do it with football).
And the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloé Sevigny - provides for a substantial game 'Fine the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is involved in the ability of a doubtful propaganda-drama - a killer who produces a reagan mask is involved - that it often plays as one.
With six long episodes there are, and the commodity is not enough or often enough.
"Comrade Detective," who was rediged at a lower length, could be better delivering his actor chair, since Gregor and Iosef are always visiting the American message that Lobby has always been placed by two sick men who disappeared a hamburger.
The message for the imagined communist public is that western culture can make everything for food for a place.
The fixed Roman Creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own younger history and with the swimming.
Drug-mafia in the country
The police is a struggle against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, we were investigating numerous objects in the Blackwald Barry, Rottweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the State Authority informed Constance on Friday.
In addition, 15 accused of age between 25 and 77 years of age were arrested and had already been sentenced against them.
Moreover, the officers made more safe marihuana and cocaine, shooting weapons and several hundreds of thousands of euros.
Two persons were arrested at temporary races in Italy.
The two suspected Italians had a German sentence.
The two of these are probably extracted to Germany.
The action was participated in Italian and Belarus investigators.
Over 300 police officers were in total.
Mafia's members are designed to organize drug criminality, serious violence, tried murder, rape and pressure.
Since summer 2016, the State Authority Constance has been identified against the organized drug traffic in South German space.
Among the State Authorities in Constance and Palermo was a rigorous exchange and the investigators of Cripo Rottweil had closely contacted their colleagues on vineyards.
The great involvement was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
In the vision of the investigations, mainly, Italian nationals were closely referring to the Italian mafia.
An incident on 27 May in half, where several shoes were shooted in a guest place, could go on the band account.
In a way, large shoes in the foreign register
"Dates of citizens that should not be found there": a report shows significant deficiencies in Germany.
This leads to severe lack of decisions in asylum procedures.
The author for the Federal Government's Refugees Management, Frank-Jürgen, took note of a media report on large shoes in the foreign central register.
Many of the data registered there could lead to "to dealing with severe decisions" in case of asylum procedures and decisions, warning in an analysis that presents the "South German newspaper".
In the register, the information has been taken by ten million people with foreign nationality, including about 5,7 million from non-EU States.
The data are managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Since data were not sufficiently collected, the data quality in parts has not been good until then.
In some cases, data were found from 1921, "of people who have not been alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually be in the register."
The report continues: "The wrong data input can delay significantly the return processes", says the report.
In the statistics on exciting persons, however, EU citizens who should not be experiencing.
However, such wrong adjustments were "to a decreased debate on the processing of exile responsibilities", says the analysis.
However, the federal government has obviously started to return refugee families with 16-year-old children to Italy when they were coming from there.
The BAMF reports the "new Osnabpresser Journal" from a internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees.
The paper indicates that the BAMF has implemented these "faming families with children - with the exception of skins and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, the newspaper was not more possible, so in reference to the difficult situation in place.
The Dublin Agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU, first reaching them.
If a migrant continues to another EU country, this State may return it to the homeland.
The Bureau now writes: "In the meantime, the acquiring capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly."
Italy has issued for the accommodation and accommodation of families guarantees.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECMR) is sufficient.
Other EU States would also return refugees within the Dublin Agreement.
The internal political speaker of the Legal Group in the Federal Day, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Family with children are threatened by the lacks of the Italian asylum system of human rights and a threat to child's well-being."
Second results
Overall, 220 litres of people living in the upperbarian bach have already provided the blood detention service for other people.
At least from the 12 citizens who were expressed on Friday.
All prior to Jürgen Greule, who shared with 100 feet in the area 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, the community accepts the multifunctional disposal of blood at the meeting of the Council.
"It's fantastic as our body has been designed, and we shut up respect for the sponsors that provides their blood for the foreigners, even unbelievable to it," stated Master Karlleinz Kistner.
"A only blood slaughter helps several people," explained the head of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the conservations are displaced in their components.
That's how three people could benefit from a surgery.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported the actions carried out in the early year in Oberreichenbach.
"In this year we achieved with 114 expenses the secondest result", said the DRK Chief.
Of course, the change in the theatre house has led to higher numbers for some years.
Before this, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were excited to the multifunctioners, and 50 of them were excited.
Half so many visits Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and your Vetter decades from their life bedroom.
The Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is likely later announced that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the decline of inflation have reduced speculations.
The Bank of England warned that the economic growth will remain "funds" when it contributed to the interest rates on family income in a increased pressure.
The monetary Committee's political decision-makers agreed with 6 to 2 in order to maintain the interest rates at 0.25 %, with less Members to increase in this month, since the weak economic growth has failed to increase.
In its fourty-year inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth prognosis for 2017 to 1,7 % and for 2018 to 1,6 % and warned that pressure would continue to be income, and that inflation in the original would be still increased by about 3 %.
But she reported that in the next years, interest increases would be needed to increase the inflation raised by Brexit and said that credit costs might be more than expected on the financial markets.
The members also agreed to return a part of the Mammut Conjunction package issued a year ago after the Brexit.
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide more financial for banks since February, although it was said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of sterling.
After the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central prognosis of the MPC, the Great domestic product (BIP) remains short-term weak, as the pressure on the real revenue of the budget continues to be the consumption."
In terms of interest, she repeated that "a certain punishment of the monetary policy" would be necessary for the decay of inflation and a "also greater" measure than the markets expected.
The markets currently prognose the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "slowly" and "limited".
The bank's following correct growth prognosis for this year and next year are compared to 1,9% and 1,7% pregnosed in May.
It has maintained its growth prognosis at 1,8 % in 2018.
The fund went after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound was 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and slowed 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision is not amended after the recent increased growth rates have reduced the increased expectations to increase interest rates and the GDP has increased by 0.2 % in the second quarter of 0.3 % in the past three months.
The growth will be expected to be at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easy to recover the bank at the end of the year.
The recent inflation report was little shocked for budgets affected by a increased inflation and smaller decline, since the heavyness will first be worse before it becomes better.
She added that the monetary policy in the next years could not "interfere to income", but added that the wages will be "declared" at the end of their three years' prognosis.
The economy is also strengthened by the increased demand of British goods, which is to be refunded to the weakest fund, which will compensate a part of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision takes a year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the sense of the fund.
The bank estimates that it will probably be for four years until the prices and economy will be completely achieved.
Before the last judgment of the bank to the interest rates, the call was increased after an increase in interest, since the inflation increased the pressure on hard-risk budgets, with three political decision-makers demanded an increase of 0.5% in July.
In the last month, the inflation was slowed to 2.5% in June, although the bank said that this was expected and will return to it in the next months.
The bank said that the overruning in relation to its objective of 2% should be "ganz" to the weak fund.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline of Swap rates, the hypotheke market should be more competitive, since creditors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner.
The market looks particularly good for those in which the existing contracts are dealing and the new hypothekes are closed, and many of them with free options and low rates will always be more favorable."
NHS (National Health Service) is intended to describe anti-AIDS drugs 100,000 people
Patients will have access to a "transformable" HIV prevention treatment after the High Court to the financing of the medicine in the NHS since September.
NHS England acknowledged that a pre-exposition prophylaxe (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of high risk patients around 86 per cent, is now delivered by the health services through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He was willing to finance the process after confirming a sentence of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year, whereas the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP, despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The shooting announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aid Trust (NAT) called this "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to allow the registration of humans, and other clinics will be followed in October before it be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018.
Pre-exposition prophylax (PREP) is a consequence of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have demonstrated that PrEP significantly reduced HIV transmission in infections threatened.
PrEP before sexual traffic means that there are only sufficient medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual trafficking.
For those who are concerned for treatment, there are genuine or bisexual men, transexuals, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
Available participants are identified in clinics, including men, women, transparents and individuals who have a partner whose status is not known by controlling antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered at a home physician can also register their possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The programme will be signed by 10 million and NHS England a contract on the delivery of medicines in this week after an international competitive acquisition.
The study aims to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical loans as it is intended to be incorporated, incorporated and implemented in a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should add and overcome the broader and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another million stone in the continued progress of over three decades in addressing one of the largest health challenges of humanity."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is aimed at the needy and dangerous people, provides the possibility to change English HIV epidemies.
From September, people with high HIV risk have access to this NHS financed attempt in England to develop a new tool that is really controlled individually, and does not undertake negotiations with a partner, which leads many of the lives.
We fully welcome this proclamation."
Ian Green, President of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be understood that the study will be done quickly in the whole country, and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left.
Now, since the PrEP testing has been provided, we are the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Deputy Minister of Health, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overcome after months of late and detrimental implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of these live-changing infections.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that this study will be performed as soon as possible in the whole country to protect people who are HIV infected, and that they will help us to draw closer to the end of the dissemination of HIV in society.
The great life: between shoes and clue designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court Apartment to a great house
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a suffering for real estate, reduced 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a former Court Apartment.
It is located in the first skate of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it is a proof for the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold its taches.
"I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a very larger room," says Joanne.
"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.
This apartment was shown in the Court of Earl, and she had the same high coat.
I loved them and made a offer on this day."
Since the first review, the 1.000 square flight was completely extracted.
Originally, a room house with a swimming layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Stauraum and a interim shooting to use the big swimming cable height.
"I wanted high thick, big window, much light.
That was my request," she says.
To this end, she asked the architectural and design study Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi to use the 12.5 feet high footsteps and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne.
The deck was not enough to put two rooms to each other, so the architectonic challenge was to create a interim shock in which you could stand.
He had to think creatively to solve the offer.
"The steel work is quite complicated," he says.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were shocked each other without we had to beat us.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to set the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.
For the interview, a classic copper window of Retrouvius looks below over the glamorous residence area.
Effected gold mud, silver acents and Vintage Serge Mouille shows the style for the program.
The use of Spiegels plays a role when adding the theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is reflected to allow him to take more effect.
In the kitchen it feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, reflected units offered place for all beaches and grains of Joanne.
The beauty of the living room can send the kitchen if not used.
Coffee kitchen are nothing new.
The specialist here is that it's a garage agent.
"A little engineering art went there", says Erfn from the steel strengthened, burned MDF tour.
"It's counterweight, so that if you shoot the door very easy."
Thanks to the clear use of room and stauraum, Joanne could win additional 16 m2, a additional bedroom and a improved layout.
"After the end of the day, you will sell the ground - or, as you are estimated, your real estate", says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate matrice will be introduced and a calculation is based on the ground size."
Here they have been able to increase the soil surface and to use high-quality materials that give their luxurious advantages to the room.
"The materials are the things you're touching and therefore helping them to create an emotive connection in a house," says Erfan.
"You don't love you in the electric steck doses in the walls.
These are important, but they're not playing with your hearts."
It shows that a apartment can be transformed through good design and increased square count of something normally into something very surprising.
Indeed, like Joanne, you might have decided not to leave this.
Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollars real estate imperium
Two brothers were four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an interference because of one of the largest real estate imperial Victorias, more than $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his young brother Paul. This has brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to explain how to share their property and business resources.
Paul wants to return from the family business since 2014, but a deep interference on the separation was held in the Supreme Court of Justice.
With her mother Anna, 38 real estate brothers have more than a million of dollars, joined since 1973 the family purchased a business in the Smith Street, Collingwood.
The Westco Jeans family founded a chain of 160 private trade.
It was sold for 85 million US dollars for 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and buying centres in the city.
Following an agreement with his father, Colin has Paul's "the head officer and the dominant personality" in the family De Lutis, about two thirds of the company's possession and Paul’s about one third.
A court states that this means that Colin ownership has $316 million and Paul valued by $176 million.
The department of real estate and bargeld has proved to be a problem point for Paul.
"The departments proposed by Colin have left him with what I had for the best objects", he wrote in 2015 in a first affiliate.
On Friday last, the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held after several sentences.
Brothers are now fighting for controlling the existing business - which Colin, as Paul says, has excluded him.
Colin argued that this is not true, but Paul intends to manage some possessions incompetent.
In an early African, who was sent by Colin, he said he hopes to join the war.
"My Italian heritage says that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs are increased in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, E-mails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both lawyers.
Ms. De Lutis and her murdered husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who employed milk and delicate business from the late 1950s and purchased a business in Brunswick in the early seventy years.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood Association, in the Colin opened the first Jeansload of the family.
Colin says he began there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little kid (approximately 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 hoped to give her own to her sons goodly.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers before the courts," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis entrepreneurship group, where Colin states that mark was paid when the company leaves $10 million and Luke 26 million.
Although Lukas and Mark were, Paul says, "the conditions of their financial separation were denied".
Colin was very resting, although he was a former AFL state member and after a biography from Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star in 2015.
Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their applicants.
Just Colin answered by SMS to say, "I can't really say much," because the case is before the courts.
"It's very regrett that my brother Paul has decided to punish me and to take our family names through the courts," he wrote.
Within the midst of 2016 Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want Paul and I would end in our present combat," he said and added that he "forever on a solution. "
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our affair will be resolved in near future by the courts," wrote Colin.
Trumps planted a new head to limit the media abstinence of the President.
Others tried it, and they're lost.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Political reports that the new head of the White House plans to restrict the information flow on President Trump, including the reports of the media, in hope to keep the Chief at an equal course.
This is a part of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"If John F. Kelly, the new head of the White House, joined his first working day with leaderships, was a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that had been given in the hands of the President.
Kelly said to the employees that information on him should be flewn - or on paper or in letters - because the President would take better decisions if he receives good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to shape Trump by monitoring its media.
President Trump's television relationship is sufficient for decades - and now where he is in the white house, his television is still strong.
"When Candidat Trump was enhanced because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a full reporting of offices to be convinced", said the former election council Sam Nunberg in February against Political.
Politicals Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps's Twitter habit is under control, according to six former election camp officers there are to ensure that his personal media consumption is a permanent loving price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever "sub control" is laugh.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets had had contained without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the Tweet that the Trump has not sent.
If his employees made it possible to keep the wrongs away from him, then their efforts were rewarded.
But no one has thus been able to prevent Trump's controversies.
One part of the problem is that people in a white house, which is composed of competitive parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump materials that may promote their views from the world.
Political - all with this story - reported in May on the favors of the advisers to make the President doubtful information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Gold Macher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump, like a vulcan, can react to negative presses, especially those with damaged skins, and that he is able to find out where these are.
Like the end of February, when someone had a pressed copy of a article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provokator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the stab chief Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a shop of Lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from skandans from Twitter, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that in the past he expressed false prejudicies and called it.
Trump read the article and began to ask workers about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the current stage Chief Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "successed to implement a system to manage and document the paper channel that receives the Trump."
How did you get it?
Kelly tried to do the same three months later.
Maybe he will prove to be a more effective manager as a Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still seek to influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Mostly engaged criminals receive post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the aid of the population will be offered and expected.
The police in all Europe sends postcards to dangerous crimes in this summer (virtual) card.
Since the addresses of the requested slaughter are not naturally known, guidelines are expected and supplied from the population.
Europol reported on Friday of the action following the EU Most Wanted Adventual Calendar.
Experiences showed that many refugees are hiding vacation destinations, called Europol.
21 post cards for searching offenders from 21 EU countries have been compiled.
Since 2016, there is the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2,5 million times it was seen.
36 of the online visits could be arrested at the time, at least 11 of which due to the information provided to the publication on the website.
Re traveling negotiations about a grain and return to 'millionary'
Some of the most well-being houseowners of the West Midlands are back with some decisive travelers to war stakeholders who have negotiated one of the crowns taken from the community to request a field before their rulers.
The travellers have parked their 20 residential cars outside a well-being street of Solihull, which is called "millionarys Raihe".
They brought horses, kids and a army of transporters after they were purchased in May without being struck by one of the slaughtered grains to prevent their accidents.
The tactic group found a slow in the defence devices and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unlimited to find a way.
Incredible people have threatened the Solihull Council, who said it is "not useful to address the problem".
A anonymous resident said, "They were taken there on Monday after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they hired stones on the passengers.
The Council has to be obliged to implement in fact, since it was unuthorised when he addressed the problem.
The travellers were there in May, moved and now returned.
More last night came, probably even more today."
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to do this by maintaining long-term education to protect their parks.
I live on the streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council can't even stop it."
One people who did not want to be called said, "It's sweet, we just saw the last round of these travelers only to be cut by another round.
The numbers have grown up this time and they have even seen a horse in the park area."
A speaker of the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an invalid placer on the country outside the streetsbrook Road and working together with the police of Solihulls. We take the necessary legal steps to continue as soon as possible.
To support our proof congregation, it is very important that many people may report an anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling them 101.
This helps us to create a picture of the situation where the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the forest hotel Luise is.
The house is now renewed before the gate of the city of joy and is intended to be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the current operational company mbH on April 13, 2014, about 30 000 overnights per year and also income by the curtaxes.
In February 2014, the hotel building was offered to the Country Council as a collection site, which was careful for controversial discussions.
The city prevented the submission of asylum applicants by establishing a construction plan to ensure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not indefinite in the Council of Communities.
However, mainly the pleasant cities, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and then spoke of serious interests in the house.
He should keep the right.
The group of Luisen Hotels with business leader Birgit Scherer with seat in Bad Bergzabern has purchased the former hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary defense in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star Plus-Plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the joyful city object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are named Hotel Luise, Luisen Park, Parkhotel Luise and now the Waldhotel Luise.
The previous hotel Birkenhof has been located since the long time before the entry, and when you enter the house, it will be clear to which extensive renovation works are carried out.
The bowls were exhibited, cuts up to the part, old bathrooms away from the rooms.
The whole hotel building is one building.
To March there's still much to do.
"It's actually a beautiful hotel," Thomas Scherer says in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the black wood style.
The rooms are equipped with large adjacent duches, the entrance area is converted, it will be built new windows.
Everything was to be "sweet citizen near" as Thomas Scherer expresses.
"We want to make a smuggle round."
The swimming pool, the Wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.
You don't want to place on the high level of the hotels in Lauter bathroom, but already on a higher inner city level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to be wide, explains the wheel.
Even individual holidays, groups or business rooms should be pleased in the hotel.
A conversation with OB Julian Osswald and director Michael Krause, he has already carried out so Scherer.
The ideas of the city are compared with those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
After the height of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to set out exactly.
It has been calculated under a million euros.
The foreign installations are also put on the front man, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace from the restaurant, which is public, will be available in a inner court.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Free City is a good market."
Russian-Africa: U.S. Special Employer sets a Grand Jury
In Russia's appeal on President Donald Trump, Sonderrmittler Robert Mueller has established a so-called Grand Jury report.
In the last few weeks, the group has included the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, in vocational vocational persons with the matter.
The newspaper estimated the step as a sign that Mueller has extended and intensified his research.
The Sender CNN reported that it was already given the first invitations of the body in relation to a meeting between Trumps' older son and a Russian lawyer.
The US Secret Services have been accused of the Kreml for a long time since they have been engaged in the presidency campaign in 2016.
Mueller examines whether there were discussions between Trumps' election campaign and Moscow.
In the context of the investigations, several men should be acted as advisers of the Republicans in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trumps private and business environments under the Lupe.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the other army trumpet was shocked into the centre and investigated whether the President may have discovered the justice on the road of the business.
The main task of Grand Jury is to examine these evidence in possible crimes and to decide whether the accused is to be sentenced.
The Grand Jurys is therefore called a law enforcement chamber.
They are generally activated when they are more larger and contrast cases.
The procedure always follows closed doors.
The body may also be enabled by the State Authority in order to invite persons to grant permission.
According to the shipping CNN, proposals were already issued to turn into contact between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those who participated in the meeting were requested for a statement, said in the report.
They should also provide documents.
Besides Trump Jr., Trumps' advisers and Swegerohn Jared Kushner and his former election chairman Paul Manafort were talking about it.
Legal experts said on Thursday in the United States view that the inclusion said that the Mueller did not shoot in his work and that, if it was necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it should not be pregnant that the Grand Jury will be enabled at the end to decide on a complaint.
However, the introduction of the group of starting a new phase in the surveys and a new reason for the concern of President Trump.
Among the new enthusiasms, the President used a speech in West Virginia to represent Russian appeal as a campaign for his political enemies.
"The Russian history is a total exhibition," Trump said.
The theme gives the Democratics an opportunity to "I feel good because they have nothing else that they can speak".
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb said in an opinion, he didn't know anything about the introduction of a Grand Jury.
But they also worked in the secret, he stressed.
The White House proposed any measures that accelerated the work of the other armor in a "fair" way.
The former FBI Chief James Comey said three times that the presidents would not be identified.
There is no reason to accept that there has been something changed, and it continued in the statement.
But Mueller was used only after the Trump Comey was fired.
Because of this outcome, the lawyers became aware of the Trump, he wanted to defeat the justice.
Comey said in June before a senate committee, Trump requested him to investigate the current national security advisor Michael Flynn.
The President is under pressure because of the investigation.
Following the presentation of the US media, the White House collected materials against the other arms and its employees.
The speculations disappeared whether Trump Mueller wants to leave.
On the other hand, as an independent quarter of the Congress, such as in the Watergate Africa, Richard Nixon, who was later returned, Mueller has a position in which Mueller could be theoretically shocked on the shock of the President of the Ministry of Justice.
Many senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators introduced draft legislation on Thursday, which could no longer be resolved.
Antarctics: Gigantic Eisberg in Antarctica
In Western Tartics, a gigantic Eisberg was solved by the slipper's nearby seven times size of Berlin.
This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research at midnight.
The over a million tons and 5800 square kilometers great coloss are now going to the north and will probably need two, three years until he is drunk.
He is with 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest iron guiding in the past three decades.
It's not a threat for humans.
How much the climate change has played a role in the breaking of the Eisberg, it is clear to researchers.
However, the US research center for Snee and Ice (NSIDC) has been a series of uncommon unions in the region for about 30 years.
According to many researchers, this can be associated with the earthwarming.
The now disrupted coloss was a part of the Larsen-C shelf.
Sleefeis is swimming on the sea and is shocked by big sleeves.
It continues to grow to the sea and regularly declines.
The Larsen-C-shell is located south of South America almost at the pitches of the Antarctic halfbinsel.
In the north of this wheel feed, the equality of waxes and disappearance was a few years ago.
A complete shelf is disappeared there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
Some say that the Larsen-C shelf is in danger, because the front side has never been able to go as far as it is.
Furthermore, the glass plate is under shock and can break down, if a part is broken at a key place.
The shadow of shelf and Eisberg does not increase the marine level because they swim on the water and breasts water so much as it produces after the sleeves itself.
However, the loss of the sleeves leads to the sleeves directly to the sea and can cut much more faster than previously.
This could increase the marine level, but only in low-scale, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctics (Midas).
The Larsen C-shell is the fourth largest sleeve of the Antarctics after AWI with nearly 50000 square kilometers.
On the cross of the Festland, it is up to 700 meters of dick, on the front side to the free ocean around 200 meters.
There it is regularly declining.
"Whoever it is a natural event and no direct connection to climate change is conscious of us, the Ice Swansea University now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.
"This is the most important decline since the start of the records," he also confirmed.
For scientists, if the Larsen-C Schelf is now growing or returning long-termly and may have fallen together, his College Adrian Luckman said and added: "Now models say that it will be less stabil."
But this development will last ten years.
Although these researchers do not return to the climate change of this giant ironberg, in the past decades a lot of iron sleeves of the Antarctic halfbine have defeated.
This long paragraph of the Antarctic is a direction to South America.
After data from the British Antarctic Survey, the iron surface of the Antarctic halfbinsel has fallen up to 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
At the decline, the temperature increase has contributed.
The Antarctic halfbine has been heating around three degrees in the past 50 years and is part of the areas in which the temperature increases the fastest increase.
CCU wants to be a home tariff at the staff
Because it is always more difficult to put free places, the CDU calls for the workers' association to become more attractive.
First prior to the summer breakfast, the Circuit 41 new centres have won in the management.
More than 1100 employees and officers are working for the circle management in Mettmann.
Now, 17 trainers have been training their first working day back.
In the circle, it is obviously very grateful.
round 620 applications were to describe the places to be forgiven in this year.
Nevertheless, the circle continues to be able to handle the increased requirements and tasks.
There are now places not placed before 50 in the Circs Mettmann.
It is requested among other doctors and technicians, as well as the overall management forces.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG on the Circle Day and to engage in the management of the expertise.
The management aims to develop a concept of personal benefit and personal development after the desire of the parties.
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs of experts but also to strike up the complainant's own orientation.
The overall approach should be shown by internal and external, concrete measures for coal increments and maintain a educational basis for CDU, FDP and UWG.
That's a good approach.
Because the circle has to do it with personal problems that you did not know before.
Other cities take good officers and equipment and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is a regular "competition of the public employer".
There is a high number of employees that differ from the service of sickness or older condition.
The maximum time for trade is therefore that there are no more places.
However, Klaus-Dieter Volker, the head of the CDU Group, continues to go beyond the common application.
He was so slowly concerned about a faust surprise when he issued the personal cost detection publicly and the other parties.
People want to be examined with all the possibilities that allow an outcome from the Community employer association.
"If we do not come here in a short-term solution, the circle management should be used with the workshops - maybe, in cooperation with the Greek cities, to work a home tariff", says the people.
In this way, the CDD is trying to make better payment of employees and officers than it actually prescribes the tariff regulation for the public service.
The debtors are currently prescribed exactly, increased or more money only if they change to higher levels that are orientated to professional years.
However, the tasks of the circle have grown increasingly in the past years.
First few weeks ago, new rooms were to be established, in which employees care for the provisions of the new prostituted protection law.
Not recently, by the increased number of asylum applicants, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Circle Director Martin Judgeers have a problem: you have too little staff.
Italy increases the sound to NGO relief boats
Italy has warned that the NGOs could not continue if they do not keep new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs does not sign a new comportement code, it's difficult to see how they can continue to work", said the Minister of Interview, Marco Minniti, in a interview with the tourner day period La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities invited a boat of the German help organization 'Young Relief' because their manity had worked effectively with human affairs in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has been operated since a year, refused to express its explanation of the Italian State lawyer Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us is and the salvation of human life remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and salvation zone," said the organization in an opinion on social media.
"We can just judge all the accused that are now being raised, after we gathered all the information and judge the situation."
The Italian authorities watched the ship of 'Young Rettet', the Iuven, since October.
It is convincing that its disposal of smoking shipping migrants takes board that will be delivered directly from human fellowshipers, and that the smugglers can be removed so that ships can be used again.
At least one of these meetings was only 1,3 miles before the Libyan Coast, according to the case of the lawyer whose content of Italian media was published.
The displacement shall be suspected that the authority of the Italian coastal observers should be able to monitor the rescue in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
The code of conduct must have ships like the Iuven, especially a Italian police officer who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and salvation insects are ready to keep the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
Last day, on Thursday, the new rules would be unnecessary, but acceptable, since they would not bring out their saving actions with themselves.
Among those who refuse to sign the Nobel Price Organization is the doctor without borders (MSF).
Minniti stated that the number of migrants who took place after rescue measures in Italy had been strong in the last few weeks, which indicated that the efforts to strengthen the Czech Republic and the cooperation with the local citizens.
"In the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He has announced plans for further discussion with the Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives, and with Csad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who have left these countries in hope to achieve Europe.
Storage and trials
Neon Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Foreign Posts" and two guests met in Wachenheim in the northern pool for four days to enjoy trials and visionalities.
For this, three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal showed that it was a good starting point for the tours.
The barg and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to Michael's capelle over the Deidesheim at warm summer temperatures along the winebergs.
The following spectrums, such as the doors, were able to look closely over the pellel forest and the levels pre-related.
Dazwischen has always been more than the long trials rewarded.
On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the People's Festival Market.
Once again, the spectrum was covered by "flowing" trials and moderate attractions.
In the last two days, many heights were reared.
Hospital, rocks, towers, snakes, ruins and shoes have welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers entered the heavy sun in the free lunch hall.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 miles [173 km] and about 4500 m] height, the group had learned the Pfälzer forest from its best - sportive and cultural side.
Konsole instead of Rasen - Federal Liga is equipped for e-sports
Sit the sport stars in the future before computer consoles instead of fighting wind and weather over the stadium race?
The fact is: E-sports are long to a severe sector, become a lucrative business - large stars, millions of fans and large tourists with high guests.
This has also recognized the first federal links that are increasingly involved in this area.
The beginning of 2015 of the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04, and finally the VfB Stuttgart, which founded a E-Sport Division, and adopted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to join youth target groups for the VfB", says Chief Jochen Röttgermann.
He's sure that "this is up to this train, even some of them."
In the next weekend, the FIFA World Association organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, in which the games of various clubs occur.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, have been qualified by Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV endhoven.
Robin Dutt also looks great potential in e-sports.
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen has an Agency for Virtual football players.
"The real football must, in particular, exclude with the 14-30-year-old boys that young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old boys.
And: Verine tried to héberge all possible markets, especially Asians.
With the prominent e-sporters under the Treaty, you can be able to be present on these markets as to send the Federal Links to Asia only once a year.
What's exactly what's going on?
In e-sport computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Contrastrike" or FIFA simulation on competition levels.
A long time, as in the normal sport, ligations have been enabled, in which the professionals face each other.
And with Asian games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it really a right sport?
For many, the idea is safely necessary.
Ingo Frobose has also been discussed with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the Dutch Sports School in Köln, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and many biological and physical reactions say that you also find in classic sports - for example, increased heart frequency, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
Furthermore, it requires cognitive abilities, technical and tactical understanding and rapid reactionability.
Professional gamers should not only train their body and observe food.
"The Fit Player is a good player."
Frobs also see problems: "Doping will always be a subject".
Controls were difficult in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sport were missing.
Positively, the scientists have the high integrative effect of the e-sport.
The players are internationally walking, this is like a great global family, there is no intercultural paths.
A study of the Enterprises Advisory Deloite and the Federal Association interactive entrepreneurship software (BIU) suggests that e-sports have a slight growth.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsoring and large tourists.
In three years, the overall rate of 130 million should be.
With the slightly 2,4 billion euros of the football liga, it is little.
However, the e-sport is "not far from the other enabled sports such as handball, basketball or eishockey", the Deloite manufacturer writes.
Internationals are still many countries.
Great markets are Asia and the United States where Ex-Basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseball star Alex Rodriguez in the US team NRG e sports.
Hollywood student Ashton Kutcher investes in the eSport Weather provider unikrn.
There are also some in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports have been introduced as a educational point, Frobose says.
In the Netherlands and in France, the football liga rings are obligation to establish an e-sport division.
"The European comparison calls back to Germany," states VfB-President Röttgermann.
Only to lose in nostalgie, and to explain the old times, it is not enough today.
It goes to maintain the tradition of the Agreement, but the company also set up on the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dott.
"That can't make sure that only at the football remains like it was always."
Gaft-Ear Ade - The egg alternatives to cook and bags
From scandal to the most frozen eggs, almost all federal countries are involved.
Aldi South and Aldi North have reacted and took all the eggs from the sale.
The regular should only be taken into eggs that are obviously not containing fipronil.
Michelle Carter condemns Conrad Roy to suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced for two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls to self-mort.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will be carried out 15 months after his guitars and five years have been expelled.
Carter was sentenced in June because of an emergency murder by Conrad Roy, who took the life on July 13, 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is unfortunate.
My son was my best friend."
Carter remained free to vocational.
She was confronted with a maximum punishment of 20 years, but her lawyers claimed that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a psychological disease.
In red hair and a crome colorful blue, Carter was in the eyes with sweet hands and eyes sent down when she was condemned.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the lawyer said to the Court.
"He finished his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility," she said.
"He hasn't shown a virgin."
But Carter's lawyer said it's a "that's a terrible condition that she's fully lacking."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said that he did not find that you have “old or rifegrad or even their mental disease a significant impact on their actions”.
A State lawyer reads a statement of Roys Mother Lynn Roy that said there's no day in which I don't believe the loss of my loved son.
I want that he is proud of me and how I am around everywhere. I try, despite all my pains that we will be brought to us forever, to be there for his sisters," says it.
Roys sister, Camdyn Roy, said she will "prosecute" from the knowledge that she will never be involved at the marriage of her brother or would be a tank for his children.
"No more to have this only person with whom I was joined every day since my birth is a pain that I will always be keeping with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to have a case of predictation, since there is no law in massachuset that makes it a crime to require another to act on self-assault.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 to a carbon monoxide in a vehicle.
The case took national attention after Carter’s text communications expressed that he had encouraged him to end his life.
"Spoke you, spring from a building, first you yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news she sent her in the two weeks before his death while he was with his family in vacation.
In the moments before his self-defense she wrote: "You must do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do, the generator will be cut and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter searched attention by the death of Roy and ordered to benefit by any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Amanda Knox, who was sentenced for the murder of her British council in Italy for two years before she was released.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter wins feeling and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new Mini Lahm of the FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich stopped as Captain at Audi Cup is no accident.
The FC Bayern believes that the Confed-Cup seat is a great season - Extra-motivation does not harm there.
There was something different on his place in the box that Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the additional clothing room was very small.
But as far as the second day of the Audi Cups did not see Philipp Lahm and did not see a new Manual, he made the dedicated bridge to his arm.
"The trainer has not announced it," the Confed Capsitee sees back, after his first use as Bayern captain.
Well, the instance could be better than at 0:2 against the SSC Neapel.
But the sign of the coach could also declare Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a player from youth players, debtors and C-Elf just from the holiday, but he.
Zuckerl is most loved to share those who want to keep the laune.
So whoever has been excursive to come to the heritage of Lahm, a small extra motivation can only be useful.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On midnight the 22-year was a mini lahm over the field.
Right down, this is his position, the white band on the arm made her over.
And all the way Kimmich did in this starting form, like those who could take the ruder the best.
He gave instructions to try to slay the unsigned troop.
He had the look at all, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal to overcome his lack of fitness (spoke little); Renato Sanches to join the benefits of the Asian travels (clapps only as well); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle, in order to not decline in their first invasion in the Bayern Trait.
It's all right.
Scule went next to Kimmich, Rudy before the slaughter, both acted sovereignty.
The napoli storm was often hard, also tried to play a few times.
His colleague Rudy acknowledged that the result was "not as we hoped it."
But he also showed a general performance at the debtor.
Game movement, time change: "For this style I was also obtained."
As inhabited by this Bayern world is still for the new access, you've been seen in the connection to the party.
Rudy, for example, gave not one or two in the catalogs but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich adopted a few sweet words behind his new player.
There he heard a interesting word from Süle, "What comes here, I've already noticed.
You just have to win every game with Bayern."
On the other hand, he doesn't have to learn the new ones.

Enterprises satisfied with rhine-Palse Minister: Economy lovers Wissing Time
It was often unfair, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, as Eveline Lemke (Green) and the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rheinland.
This shows more than one year in which the new Minister of Economy Peoples Wissing (FDP) is at the office.
Chambers and enterprises from the region speak on T-V requests of a change in economic policy, and at the same time the old minister is able to share.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Trierer Company Association (VTU), says: "Wissing decreases the desire of the economy which Lemke has blocked all the ways."
The largest employee sees Natus in the infrastructure policy: The outcome of the trail 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now above in the country's priority list.
In this year, the Ministry hopes that it is a planning procedure, until 2021.
A role in the country's plans also plays the Western Trier action, which is in the prerequisite of the Federal Transport Plan.
The aim is to operate the routes in December 2020, says Minister speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus looks like a guide to support regional but international competitive enterprises.
The Industrial and Trade Camera (IHK) aims for Trier, as Wissing calls, for wine with a Rhine-Pafalz label to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and to stop the tenth of German wine exports since ten years.
Moreover, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to build a company, loving the IHK.
In the new Master-Bonus, the Handwork Chamber Trier looks for an additional encouragement to young trainer, says director Matthias Schwalbach.
It is expected to be a premium of 1000 euros for the existing master test and EUR 2500, if the results are self-deserved within ten years after master training.
The household list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts were fast to create, as well as it failed to the country for the necessary staff, Jan Glockauer, head of IHK Trier.
From 56 new engineers who want to set up the switch to the country industry mobility, only 29 places have been placed.
The IHK calls for more appeal to external offices.
CD-Fraktion Vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations of the Court of Auditors in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros in the maintenance of country streets.
Frank Natus also expects a country's concept, as it wants to deal with the expert lack of force in the region.
Instead, it is also the country's early wide range of bands.
In 2016, regional enterprises estimated network supply in an IHK survey only with note 3.4.
They are estimated about stored internet connections and abbreviations.
Ex-Company Minister Eveline Lemke is now out of the policy and is still in the Board of Oversight of the Wind Power Company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke to April to become the President of a private high school in Karlssruhe, where she was back to the field after four months because of inconsistents.
Audi intends to change 850,000 such vehicles - Auto manufacturers see a contrary reaction
One day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW President said that the company is the view that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" and that is the case of European cities, including coins where BMW is able to prohibit or restrict such vehicles.
Daimler acknowledged on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes fabrics in Europe to reduce its digital emissions.
None of the companies described the submissions as a return.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of such vehicles in Europe and in the United States to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions.
But the stick oxides that emit the cell motors are as carcinogen and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install installations to neutralize the exciting expenditure by the vehicles are also difficult to keep the price of the cars competitively.
The German Federal Officer Angela Merkel is also accused of shutting the powerful autonomy companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The enterprises try to avoid the errors of the people's car that the use of such discharge devices could regulate emissions to maintain the rules when a car was tested but returned to normal vehicle conditions.
In the United States, several employees have been accused of people's cars, others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former leader of the thermodynamic was arrested in the development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zacheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected before extradition and could be sentenced in the United States.
In the beginning of this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations in the public cars after accusing the Audi authorities to have installed a system to implement the emission rules in Europe, and a demand that focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be difficult to deal with the people's cars: The Luxus auto manufacturer has a superproportional contribution to the profit of people's cars.

Mordillos clouds and the laugh against the pain
Mordillo was timely one of the most public chartoon designers, the clouds of his figures are his mark.
Also with 85 marks the Argentinian and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, "then there are too many suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years, as a artist, he became a witness for happiness cards - what frustrated him.
"The most happy day in my vocational life was the day as lost in my job," he said once.
After statistics in Lima, New York and Paris ended in the 1960s of the break: with the publication of his cartons in "Paris Match" and then in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Once again, the artist was inspired by the citys.
Big Ben in London and the red place in Moscow are large, surrounded by Mordillo fibers.
On early morning he sits his own information, as well as today on the sign, works almost ten hours every day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for green and small, T-shirts, particles and watchs will still find its sharp figures worldwide.
Since six years, he worked on a character trick film and a TV series with its figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a twice - the animal liked by Mordillos in his desktops - who has a thousand feeder than a player.
First of all, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema invasion in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The dry book is not written by him.
Therefore, it puts it more on the TV series, which are, like its original labels, which will be produced without a production.
Lavender from the Provence of Climate Change threatens
He has become a symbol of the Provence in South America, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is slow because of the conditions remedyed and the insects of the diseases, what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions provides great head pain.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Institute, CRIEPAM in Provence, said: "The lavendel in Provence is effectively threatening because the plants in the past years have affected the impact of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring year and much more in the summer.
This has an impact on the lifetime of Lavendel.
There is also a small cycade, a microbacteria that overcomes cycling, and there are very many of them with very severe weather."
And it's a lot on the game.
Lavendel oil is not only locked for holidays, it is also very requested for parfum and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, subdeveloped and missed or missed.
So we have less parts with atheric oil."
The solutions to be taken into consideration include a better water distribution and the slowing of the swimming area from the ground, but also the provision of plants with a protective mixing of tons and water and the development of species that are more resistable to the severity.
The town Geisa in the Trinity Round celebrates its 1200-year-old existence.

The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The workers of the week period of Riodoce are normally meeting to review their plans for reporting the most recent Chaos in the Sinaloa state through organized crime, corrupt officials and unrelated drug warfare.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were informed that it is important to change their rutinity.
Two high-range journalists discuss what feels safeer: you should take their children into the office, which 2009 were the goal of an attack with granates, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: enemies, neutralities, associates.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to enrich the appointments and feelings of swimming.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, business laws, journalists that are suspected to stand on the list of contents of the government or cards, a catalogue of offenders who are threatening the chaos of Mexico.
There is no calm breakout of violence, and while the bodys in the whole country are built, there are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has been held his office in December 2012. 589 were at attacks and threats under federal protection and at least seven deaths in this year.
Among the latest, her exhibitors and her inspirer of Riodoce, the co-funder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest error is to live in Mexico and to be journalist", wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His lack is deeply recognised, although his presence is overall - a large photo of Valdez that shows his medium-finger with the word "Justice" is in the fassade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the three-third years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, have a T-shirts that shows his laugh face with Brille or his typical panamahut.
The workshop finds less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their alptspaces, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a special advisory authority was established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists, it has introduced only two criminal procedures to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Like the majority of thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crimes every year, the murderers of journalists are only rarely in court.
In Riodoce, they still have to treat Sinaloa's violence, although they are unfortunate and even now the terrain is even more tragic.
Without information about the killer, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to spend my time in this workshop," he says.
"When we don't know why, we all miss."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper office in the headquarter of Culiacan.
He only created a few blocks far before his red toyota Corolla was held by two men. He was shocked from his car and was shooted on him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the "Twoirth River" is translated.
The shooting went out in his car and damaged it nearly.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Guests are nine to move to Culiacan freely.
But on the subject Valdez, there's nothing practically like sweet.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the most destructive struggles of the country, whereas rivalous groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa each day someone or several people will be shot on the street or that the Friedhof is full of shocked, two-drawn muscles for drugs that are larger than many houses for lives.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of the "Ruhe" when only one card has control over the coast state with its valuable ports and drug harbour routes in the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-funder and director of Riodoce, with the fault that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the rivaling cards in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have decreased the sons, constituted Gang members have purchased each example of the expenditure as long as they were delivered to newskioske.
The second error was not to force Valdez after the appointment of another newspaper published the same story to leave the country to his own security.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and foreign, and his murder is seen as a milestone in the mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.
He was in 2003 as an experienced reporter for the Norwegians when he closed with five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US-Dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "who is impossible to employ journalism without shooting on the smoke problem," said Bojorquez.
At the time, the newspapers received a call because of the modest and honest reporting, and the approach and the advertising were taken.
Reporters loved it to publish hard-trained investigations without fear of Zensur, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they were able to read stories that nobody else had to treat.
Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the predictable "Maria-Moors-Cabot" price for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of the mexican drug history, where she was always engaged.
He volunteered that he was afraid.
"I want to survive," he said at the time of the CPJ label.
Drug traffic in Sinaloa "is a life-wide", he said in an interview with Rompevento-TV last October.
"They must take the task that you like as a journalist - either that or you play the dumbs.
I don't want to be asked, "Why did you do so many dead... why didn't you tell what happened before you?"
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always take his hair.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar against the office and sit on the same table.
Now they ask, was his love to ruin his destruction?
His death has also forced her to ask their own acceptances about how they can achieve their best work and keep their lives.
"You don't like it if you're busy with her women, their children, their clean business, their home start and land trains," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high measure of self-detention and self-conservation.
He trusts his own instincts.
If it's wrong, leave it.
The crime is, said the exhibitor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, "Search a sense that can be struck ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, do not apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other States, where a gifty mixing of lucrative smuggles, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changed.
In the area where the workers of Riodoce came to security training, no phones were initially allowed, and a day ago has been known that spywares that are only sold to governments were used to monitor journalists and activeists in Mexico.
Outside, two police protected the hill of 104 degrees (40 °C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were employed by the country government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-off building in a medium-class club of Culiacan.
Some reporters asked whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police, which the Governor himself was not confidence.
There are months since the reporters have been in the mountain country where drugs are in fact controlled.
For the output of this week, Riodoce has seen three main historys.
It was the murder of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposure on the State expenditure focused on the city of the guerrors.
And there was a group in one of the most precious restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the State lawyer's office.
There was no official word about who has been cut off or how it happened, so it was given care when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drugs and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a political politician, who heard the government of the institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which was almost all the political levels of the century.
Recently, several PRI governances were accused of corruption.
Villarreal requested the reporter to write about previous accidents in this local, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman was a military accident.
Only a few months ago, the readers had viewed the columns of Valdez than the most informed source of the explanation.
"We had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the name "El Flaco" because of his sweet body station.
"There are all channels of communication with our sources.
The office of Valdez was surrounded to the conservation room for signs and clothes that protest against the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something that they had never expected: actors in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning because of another journalist to the office of the State lawyer.
Salvador Adame lost three days after Valdez was killed, in the Western Michoacan State.
A burned body was discovered and the officials said, based on DNA tests that it's his.
In the whole country, journalists have become more deep by written in organized Protests "SOS Press" on ways and buildings.
On this day, the Governor Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spontaneize journalists and to kill them because they said the truth.
She has therefore requested that it be re-distributed by the government, because it is concerned that her wrath has damaged their objectiveness.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organized crimes, government officials involved in it and an equivalent society "transmit".
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug bands but also on the command of politicians and security forces that were covered by organized crime.
The Media Watching Group "Articulo 19" has sent more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," Ramirez said.
Obviously the murder has a terrible effect.
Nobody forgot the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.
The body was found together with a note that was signed by the Zeta card: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer station and head listeners standed next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nord in the northern border of Chihuahua after the murder of the co-responsed Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue how El Manana did from Nuevo Laredo after the murder of her director in 2004.
2010 The Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cards with a license on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have been fled from their home states or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in the exil, and they still observe the streets and search for dangers.
And sometimes she will be shocked how it is obvious to the photograph Ruben Espinosa, who was killed with four women in a apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight of Veracruz.
For those who remain and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risking decisions.
Ibarra, who first wanted to be a shock, is that the drug traffic is scared of him.
"Mexican goes to hell, and so I became a reporter," he said.
To midnight last Friday, when the last exhibition was over, the editors of Riodoce were on the citizenship before the office and draging birds once they started summoning all their phones.
A number of shoeses with bander rivals and security forces near the Badeort Mazatlan had left 19 dead.
The war has continued to scalp how it was promised by a number of cards in the region.
From the borderstone center they published the news on the Riodoce website via phone.
The title page had to be changed on the next day.
Sirenen shouted near - another shoes in the area.
Bojorquez had a look at the police who had a watch to see whether they were ready.
If they were afraid, they didn't show it.
Under the violent portrait of the cause of the newspaper, which was visible for the entire Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed their shoes.
"When you can just stop thinking about," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day, when Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send them to report on the road."
Dinosaurier used to avoid his enemies
At the first sight it looks like a statue, even a horrible.
Scientists have now found that the first knowledge of the unbelieving Nashorn of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurier".
It was so good that they could even find that his sweet skin was of romantic brain - and they said they had something from a "unfortunate past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" was called "the degree of the deepest dinosaury that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurers of the world".
The fosil is a new type of nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the circle period from 110 million to 112 million years ago.
His incredibly good-received condition has researchers who describe it as "areally remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the worst plant fresh is the best received fossil of its type.
It was found by Shawn Funk when on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, northern Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed unlikely on the place of the stone, and decided to look more accurate.
The fosil found by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleonology.
They passed the next six years to cover the wild animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) serious earthquakes.
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be enthusiasmed.
"If you're just a little blind with the eyes, you might almost believe it's sleeping," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to see.
"It will be in the history of science than one of the most beautiful and best-received dinosaurier exemplary - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurers."
Researchers have found that this plant fresh, although it is captured with a refrigeration and a walking panzer, probably was threatened by fresh dinosaurs.
The strongly painted dinosaurers used a red and white shock to hide before shooting, and used a dismissing technique that is known as a counter-specification, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would make it possible to mix in its environment and to avoid his enemies, tell experts, that it was threatened by larger dinosaurers.
The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made the first bed line in May and is now seeing at the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeonology.
Scientists have now studied the wild animal and called the Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the teams who carried out over 7000 hours to carefully discover it.
The surprising maintenance of the exemplary allowed Dr. Mitchell and a international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of shoes and shoes on his body.
They discover the container estimation, a broad defence method in the animals, which means that the pitches of creature were darker than their subpage.
Although the container estimation is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta is overwhelming the animals today.
It indicates that the dinosaurs of sufficient pressure had been struck by a fresh dinosaurer that evolution was favorable to eliminate the confrontation as means of survival.
But most of the temporary animals, which use the container estimation - think of ships, Zebras or vegetables - are much smaller and more tragic than beasts, which reports that this nodosaurier had been a real fight to survive.
"Starkes raubier behaviour on a massive, strongly enhanced dinosaurer shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the round time must have been", said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic connections in its scale also shows that the skin of the dinosaurer was root.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal's instructions on his life, including his storm content, to find out what it had been eating as his last time.
They believe that the dinosaurer, when he died, was shocked into a river and was shocked out to the sea where he put on the back of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was so warm as Southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably have much more landier than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really noted because he is fully covered with sweet skin, but also remains in three sizes and remains the original form of the animal," brewn said.
"The result is that the animal is almost like today as in the early round time.
You don't need to use a lot of phantasie to rebuild it. If you just shoot a little with the eyes, you might almost believe that he is at sleep."
The circle time was a time, as a huge theropod, fleet-free dinosaurers, who stood on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyransaurus Rex, lived a million years after Borealopelta, the shocked dinosauries was shocked by some of his horrible pastures.
This belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of serious monster.
Scientists, whose recent knowledge appears in the Current Biology Journal, believe that Borealopelta was trapped after death in the sea and has been mutatised in the slamm.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near the Fort McMurray north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's most sweet dinosaurs, including skin and skin, and is completely from the sweet to the midst.
The creatures were averagely approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1.300 kg).
It got two 20-third skins that were shocked by his shoes.
The researchers believe that the worst plant fleet was shocked through the Western Canada until a overflowd river flowed it into the open sea.
But the underwater depositment of the dinosaurier preserved his location in exquisite details.
The hidden rests of this special examples are so well obtained that the other Hs still check up hot panzer plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of maintenance is like a win in Lotto.
The more I see it, the more confusing it will be.
Increased remains of the skin still cover the hot panzer plates that bring the shoes of the animal.
His right front floor is on his side, his five fingers are split up.
I can count the shoes on his soil.
In weight: Mass carboat at A8: Many lost
Heavy accident on Sunday on the A8: Only 30 vehicles are carried out in a mass carboat.
There are numerous losses, kilometers long stairs and garages.
On the train Stuttgart Municies (A8) late Thursday at a mass carboat at about 20 people.
After the first information of the police, there were 30 vehicles between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen stations (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a slower.
On the precise number of losses did not initially provide any information.
It's about slightly to medium-spot injuries, said a police speaker.
A great departure of relief vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely locked in the direction of München.
In the travel direction, Munich was a ten miles long back.
As reported by a AZ reporter, there were also massive difficulties in railways - by numerous donations.
The firewear noted the signs of the vehicle lockers which now have to be recruited with adverse punishment.
Shortly after 18:45 p.m. there was another second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
It was a collision between a car carrier and a Pkw.
A salvation slaughter was through the accident site.
German Bahn: Conzern tests "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everybody has experienced once: nothing of course you're sit on the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep in your work and just have a generous thought.
And then: pufff.
Come to the slaughter and switch a switch or driving the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Travel card control.
But the time of interruptions is soon over.
The German Railway is currently testing the unproofed drive card control.
Simply confirmed by phone that you take your place and evaluate the driving cards.
Currently, a test operating runs on two lines.
"If you get the offer, let's get out.
It will be expected that the next year will be available to many further television lines in Germany," said one train speaker.
"Comcomfort Check-in" the train calls the drive card evaluation without scheduler.
However, in order to use these, some conditions must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked a online ticket - what's going on the most passengers.
You must also have purchased the DB navigator's app, as well as the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And finally you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: you're getting up on the train, calling your drive cards under "My tickets".
When testing appears, a button for electronic detection appears.
The adjoints receive a report on their mobile devices that the X passenger is on the train and the booked Y seat has taken.
When the adjugator comes to the cart control at the Y place, he knows that there is a passenger with already deleted online ticket.
So you can sleep, continue working, slow.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - what should be used again.
"Whoever wants to travel without ticket controls through our adjoint personal, check in the DB browser simply.
This allows the passengers to build their journey time more personally," says Michael Peterson, Marketing for DB television.
Second Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to go to the individual customer needs."
Who often runs the train knows that, next to the late and passing trails, the drive card controls are among the largest guards.
Because often you have yourself, but one of the partners does not need any documentation that you need to discover online checks.
Or the credit card or the personal reference or otherwise is missing a document to be presented.
The results are unfinished discussions between passengers and passengers, which leads to bad stimulation in the section or large space and delays in the control of the own ticket, and takes time to care for other concerns at the end of the creator.
Not only a small number of test students can use the new service.
And it's only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund Statgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart Essen.
More train numbers on the same route are not still free.
How did a aktivist learn the answer to the question: "Why streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to her nuclear.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Georene was on the bed of an airbnb accommodation that she shooted and scrolled by Facebook on her phone.
She helped a post of someone from the High School.
"The police just killed a 18-year-old boy, and it's still on the street," he said there.
It was convinced that nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah has been constantly switched on its Timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis's area was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black boy who was killed by a white police in Ferguson, Mo., to tweet.
He posted a picture of Browns leblome body that was cast on the street and would stay there four hours.
"It's a wild one," Ferrell thought with himself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She left her phone to return to Twitter at night about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos from the police band and people who shouted, and by a man who said to be the father of Brown, who made a shild with the record: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a Live feed where a police was before a group of demonstrates with a beautiful dog.
In another video, she said, "I'll kill you all animals."
"This is not ordinary," Ferrell remembered.
"This isn't the kind of murder we've got and we can typically call."
In this moment, I felt shoot frost.
I was angry and smiling."
She bought a return and went home on the next day.
After landing at 23 a.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the films from 11.
It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the view of people living in the Community and filled the roads to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who took a flower clothes and a suitable krone, went to Ferguson, the two talked a conversation that she had a number of times before this morning "over the black experience and the black condition".
"Do you remember how I've taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
I couldn't take her back," Ferrell said later.
"What has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and to be put there.
It must be well developed, not only activeism and organization, but also the various parts of the black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves.
Even if I have the luck to give you a experience in which she personally does not experience racism, she is not different from the next black girl.
I feel that I would show her a bad service to keep them away."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florient Road, a place against the police authority, which was to a camping area, when the aktivists waited for the possible non-declaration of officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local business manager that made lunch.
They prepared the cuts and helped them to continue to demonstrates.
Unfortunately, a new type of activeism for Ferrell Geestalt began to accept.
"My activeism has changed totally after the 9th August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequality in black communities.
"I had no experience in organising.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferell met a night-demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-registers of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrors wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell in the sense: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This skepsi has been accompanied by numerous cases of people, often by white - in a Community that benefited by their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently stated in a interview, "We heard that people who were born and grown in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it different."
Folayan had already worked with Damon Davis, a artist in the field known for his activeism about deathtrainings.
Ferrell's commitment took the project closer, together with six other homes, following the team of "Whose Streets"? in the years after Brown's fire.
"This film is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us, we talk", said Davids.
"This was the main matter for me, how these people are represented, because I'm going to be drawn."
The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is "not for a Messianic leader, but for a community that comes together", said Folayan - she showed himself as the most open part of the film.
Accordingly, documents of "Whose Streets?" are surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she loves and married her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and cryed when she saw the final product for the first time.
"Af I have understood that it must be a certain injury in this work and in the mixing of black people."
Moreover, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black white women in the largest black-lives-matter movement.
Two of the three reasons of the movement that, after the murder of the black girl Trayvon Martin in 2012, the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media identified themselves as a black.
"Shears, sweet women in leadership have put the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are always fighting on different fronts.
Black, yellow women must take the main charge of all."
Folayan is true to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
It is, however, that "isn't a claimant type of action" in Ferrell, because of her identity, was chosen as a heart of the film.
"It was the person who stood this energy," she said.
"It's not a accident, although she was at the front, because in a life in these crossings as a black, black woman is so much on the game.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
The news rooms in Ferguson have long lost, but the racial connections between the community and the police are still existing.
Ferrell is on board for 21~2 years because of the blocking of a car at a demonstration.
She describes the social policy atmosphere of the area which she calls her home, "A Chaos".
However, she feels obliged to be a scene, and she feels that memory has been forced since she went to Ferguson three years ago.
"It's our obligation to fight for our freedom.
It's our obligation to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Tspace" to "great crown": discuss TV readers about Bit-Galerie
Bit-galerie moves people, although it is not built for a long time.
But the idea of a purchasing centre on the south of the footground zone has fallen from the first presentation of 2009 the population in favors and enemy.
Colt doesn't leave the topic.
Also on our Facebook page "Volks friend Bitburg" the topic is discussed.
While the one to Bit-Galerie says: "It would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be really class" (Nicoles), comes from the other side: "No man" (Siggi beds) or very light: "Green weapons!" (Lars School).
While the favorites build that a gallery is more customers in the city, which also benefits the other business, the enemies fear that the football zone will then be cut off.
Furthermore, the gallery is planned exactly on the baseline where the farmer market chain is offering its products in 13 direct markets.
With the start of the construction work, it will be concluded.
The gallery machers want to integrate a market chain in the new construction - to beda place with the possibility to be outside.
Simone Room: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years.
In particular, our eggs, but also the cooking of agriculture women will always be very pleased.
We also found the Metzgeri for us.
We would like to want that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to get this offer to be right.
In other cities, it is also.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If direct marketers set up in a market chain in the gallery, the amounts are higher.
The new project should not, however, be low."
Eva Kilic: "What are you buying camps in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find this overwhelming.
There's enough in our town.
You see how many ladder works are empty here - some of them have been for months and years.
However, as there is not yet a general weekly market here, it is so important that we have at least the market chain.
For anywhere the product offered there is fresh, most of them is offered directly from the producer and obndrein is price.
As you see, loans are used in a purchase centre only by larger companys, because the loans often are not able to be traceable for a single shop.
Injury, special business is not almost anymore and what is the rest of it will still be lost."
Wolf Fandel: "A buying center with a market hale does not pass together for me.
And the gallery doesn't go to Bitburg.
In particular, where is the farm market chain during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - also on the duration of the Bit Galerie forever.
Or is it possible to remove all business from Bitburg?
George Marquet: "This will not work.
And a shooting center that is empty, no one needs.
I think it would be better to promote a right farm market instead of this gallery.
But for a farm market chain it gave it a lot of fun - as I find - uncomfortable construction projects in Bitburg no longer.
If the farm market chain is cut down, a piece of culture will disappear."
A suitable identity: Artists create portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to see - white, black and blue, which are almost unspectacularly similar - those in cables from the deck.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from wangen tubes and hair captures sent by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the departments from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analysis was a 35-year-old prison penalty after she made it publicly a secret diplomatic report on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition opened on August 2, called A Becoming Resemblence (A suitable identity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose disciplin has joined its special competence in technology, computer science and art, and Maning, a transfrau and dismissing dissident who has been converted to the sentence of Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 ports, how someone could look with these generic data, if even some intellectual comments are not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to create an identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but since her puberty has been openly condemned as a woman, was sentenced for 20 appeals, including six infringements against the Spionage Law, Computer Drugs and the Steel.
Through the prison, her image was understood, so much that there was only one photo - a root, black-wheat sefie, in the manning's swimming sit on a driving room and a platinble pen - with which it was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
The artists produced the ports of foreigners from foreign factors such as cigarette smoke and cooking by extracting the DNA from the distance to create a image of how these people could look.
This was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper machine.
“They conducted a interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a type of portrait to join this article,” said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and couldn't be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA port.
The artists and their arrested museums were to be incomparable letter friends who exchanged several letters during two years.
They have even created one of Shoili Kanungo inspired comics "Suppressed Images", which predicted a future in which the President Chelsea would turn to judgment and would be able to see the exhibition.
That Obama was actually only a few days after the publication of the book, Manings release after seven brutal years in a military department in Kansas was a welcome type of meetings.
There is also something deep and starkes in the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump brings a war against informants from the government and against transgender trails to find new, two-willable ways to defeat the stars that he should actually shoot.
When Dewey-Hagborb was asked after the strange Timing of all these things, she said, "It's going to pass from a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, the "i" is seen in their family names with a heart) is the end of the "automatic distraction which has been based on gender, race, sex and culture."
On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written in Bleistift by thousands of Cs and Gs and As.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the high-developed scientific lexicon of artists) how amazing we are, at least biologically, all of us.
"What people are expected to be taken, is that our gene is not careful about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagbor, whose video system of 2007, spurious memorys, is also to see.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so 30 of these stories."
The latest part in the exhibition which is stored in a own room is a page of the Comic News mentioned above.
She shows Maning how they looked out with a free-speaking phone from the US Disciplinary Archaeers like King-Conng.
"When they cold your speech, they won," it says.
"Don't ever hold the mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who grew from Philadelphia.
"I'm still getting ghost when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the Comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the midst of the masks, by its own genome simulations, which are assembled as horses of Protestants.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, until the size (5 " 2, Manings Statur), in which their genetic haplo groups were written with bleistift.
"In the past, I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a majority of people," said Dewey-Hagborg from the port.
"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed himself with Chelsea, such as the movement, which also stood after their release."
Professor of Northwestern University and an Oxford university employee for murder
A country-wide human year is a professor at the North Western University and an officer of Oxford University, who is searched for suspects after a man in a luxury apartment in Chicago with murderal injuries.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest orders for murder because of their worthy participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the Office of Cook Council.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stories.
A Community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on 27 July.
The officers received a call, came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead on the place of the event, and detectives investigate the stories as a murder while the police is looking for the two suspects.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor for microbiology and immunology at the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now in vacation and was excluded by the participation of the Campus of North Western University.
"This is now a criminal matter which is investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is the senior Treasury Assistant at the Oxford University.
A speaker of the University and the Solarville College said in an e-mail statement, "Being with the police in England are ready to help the U.S. Emergency authorities in every way".
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wants to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he requested the suspects to put up the authorities.
"The police has a view of their residence place, and our efforts to localize them, strengthening themselves," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building that had just received a strict tip that claimed that there was something happening in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as a very graus.
Guglielmi said that it was unexpected if the incident also occurred on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship", said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Management Team published a statement to the inhabitants: "The police is currently working at the time and the background of the victim and investigates a variety of motivations, including a possible event."
The Russian Vice-Premier Mutko will be finished in close future.
The Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long-term until the remaining criteria of the World-Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the reconstruction of the Russian anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be implemented.
"In a certain stage of compliance with the criteria of the driving plan, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA fair plan was updated in this regard," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented the second part of the WADA driving plan to comply with the code described by the criteria for re-introduction of RUSADA and recently published on the website of the Organization.
According to Muuko, he does not contain anything that could be worried about Russia.
"All has been announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WDA in near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria referred to in the list states that the Russian antidoping officials must accept publicly the results reported by WADA's approval investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: "We conduct the investigation because our antidoping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there was no State programmes, and we will not admit something that does not exist."
Many words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian antidoping Commission.
In the conversation with the Russian sales office at the beginning of the day Smirnov gave Smirnov the problems of the past in Russian antidoping organizations, then added: "We have repeated that the report contains strict positions and rules.
No one has intended to accept this report unconditionally", added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 in the Doping Scandals by WADA by the implementation of Doping Controls in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Antidoping Doping (UKAD).
After a visit from the Headquarter of the Organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA moves "in the right direction" to be re-used.
Aldi sales first no eggs no more
This shared the company groups.
It is a pure precaution measure that could not be further taken from any health infringement, said in the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to aldi, which are apparently negative to fipronil-halting anti-lussics.
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency with his customers.
The startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Erbett wanted to measure the luck with your employees with your e-commerce-state-up, but the investigations did not work.
The answers were often white, little helpful or worse.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers do not believe the process.
"There was never a consciousness and objectivity," said Errett, who is employed by the 75-Person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside to help.
A new race of the Human Resources Startup is at the watch of helping companies to find out how their employees feel.
The establishment and license of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employer's commitment, allows it to undertake surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, to provide workers' anonymity and complaint hotlines, and, in some cases, allow Whistleblowers to implement the C Suite Guide Forces and apply directly to the Governing Council.
"You have now tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, Co-funder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools is used to measure employees' commitment.
He said they're a better view of what your employees think and feel in the three years with dent.
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows a view to which units have the majority of complaints and which leadership forces show low approval results - so that you can add why.
Enterprises are to see the need to remain in the pitches of the workplace culture so that you do not be the next squad that was carried out in Scandale since a former employee has published a blog post that describes a area of prostitution in which those who have spoken were punished.
For start-ups like dent, this desire is a lucrative business possibility after a overview.
Global Government, Regulation and Compliance Bank 2020 could have more than $118.7 billion, following the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognise bad behavior, saw an increased interest and activity in the beginning of this year in a missing credit.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has registered as a customer recently.
Like Glint, Convercent companies can send cuts "pouls" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and see the warm cards of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline with the employer to report bad behavior.
And if the principal business manager is included, the complaint is going directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The Court of Public Opinion has taken the regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and business leader of Convercent.
If a company is found that is wrongly treating its employees or is irrelevant, it can experience cost-related consequences through consumers' boycott, employees' functionation and cash, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant kitchen with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 places, has used Convercent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their business centres.
Before an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or email for the business centres, reach a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often a defense and unreasonable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Council, who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees.
Now, since the company convercents can be hidden, problems before the leadership forces that are covered in offices in cities or states, such as discrimination, distortion or unlawful practices, are identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to this universal, 360-grad style in the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who guides the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"and we protect our shareholders from employment-related areas."
Enterprises began to take more seriously the ethical, values and employees' commitment in 2002, after the booking company Arthur Andersen joined the Ethnical Abuse through the Enron Scandal, said Quinlan.
But it was long until the "social media came to their right" that companies recognized that you couldn't prevent their smuggling wheel.
"For the use of technology to monitor the ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Even Dent and Convercent offer your software as a service, and the companies will pay back costs for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in the financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with the total capital increased to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Beshaer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are not surprising in view of the connected nature of enterprises, culture and Venture Capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are expected more than ever.
In competitive markets such as the Silicon Valley, high holders and interesting projects are only income.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and estimated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, they feel that they hear their voices, and that the work you do is praise, then they feel stronger to make this company successful", said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which also uses Convercent and Lent.
Assets are achieved when their portfolio enterprises are good. Businesss are good when employees are being used and engaged.
If the analytics tools promises to increase commitment and use of employees, it is not wonderful that you find support.
The data on the employer's commitment following the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But data are not useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, if an employee asks for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn't come enough, or even not, it can swim and demotize these disappointments.
"If you ask 4.000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4.000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen the company who have left the collection of data too much.
"If you don't follow the employees, you really heard me?
Do you mind this?
And who do you do not care for this, why should I? "
Madison Reed, now conducted monthly employees' investigations, was able to conduct measures on the same day when a problem about dent is reported, so Erret.
And after the collection of feedbacks of frustrated employees, the decision-making and the quality of communication had been made to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new views on the employees, and it hopes that long-term view, which leads to a better binding of employees in a sector that is known for high-speed contracts.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you'll lose business.
The NCAA removes the two-day plans and makes a long day for the Bruin
It is at 23 hours when a lot of UCLA football players are held on a side of the new team’s training field on the campus.
Some have deleted their tricoto parts and showed the backs full swimming from the first day of the training store.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes are a breakfast.
Players who have been registered to the summer course will return after the three-second practice to their final tests before they return to the Football Center on the next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"This is a real swimming mood for the kids next three days," said Bruins Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday.
NCAA eliminates two-day operations to facilitate the last of the players, and has actually extended their days - at least until the end of the Friday.
So the first three training of the UCLA should begin at 19:15 to justify the already packed timeplans of the player.
The compromise leaves from the two days is more than one day in which the breakfast moved nearly one week after the last season and carried out practical practices during the summer school for the first time during Moras six game hours in Westwood.
They should stop during August 18. 20 before starting the formal game preparations for their attack against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA rule change, even if they add another point to the multi-employed routes of the player.
"We put this huge burden on them three or four days, and it's very difficult," said Mora.
"And they've just expressed it, they're still talking, they're good people.
I think when we come to Saturday and we have more time, it's really great."
The UCLA will finish its practices when the camp is finished, in view of the clear view lines of its fields from a limited park and the limited Luskin Center, a hotel of the highed class that has already been obtained with footballs, which will not be a light job.
Bruins players should stop the hotel from this weekend, but Mora emphasized that it could give a problem as long as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will set our security", said Mora.
"It's a real problem, and it's not very difficult to think that people have a room there and then set up there to describe a training.
If you have the video band from an exercise, it's a very good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on the park 8.
We'll do the best with what we have.
I'm not worried about it.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify facts oversight in fight against false news
Facebook wants to send more potential items with false reports to fact checkers of third parties and then show their results under the original amount, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of his efforts to fight fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to recognise possible false notifications and to send them to checkers of facts that may be shown by the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main fake news points for such a name, which many believe that they have also influenced the US Presidency election 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, while the French electioners were overwhelmed in the front of the presidential elections in May with false historys, and Germany supports a plan that should be punished after social media networks, if they are not achieved, harassed postings like the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement to German that in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new verification of facts.
"Besides the knowledge of the storys of facts checkers three parties, people want more context to take founded decisions on what they read and share," said Sara Su, the product manager for Facebook News in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its features to the "in connection" item and work on other changes in his news feed to reduce wrong news.
Create a Comic-Roman: a close in the history of England
In his recent past, the small Scotney Castle was to see in a squeeze music video, and to Margaret Thatcher was a shock in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his gentle seat in the Bewl River Tal in Kent and has now become inspiration for a graphic Roman of Jamie Rhodes, a mofaar of Yorkshireman with a favorite for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the document of someone who is dead for 300 years," he says.
"What for a personal relationship to keep this letter into my hand."
'A Castle in England' extends the time from the Middle Age to Edward's age and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another, coming British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on a archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpected emotionally.
"I've only reacted on the print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobians," he says.
"It's his thumbnail impression!
And the letters are always smiling after smoking, for at that time a fire was burned because of the light.
For a person who lives 300 years later, the skin has an effect as it would be.
Oh, I love Archive!"
For someone who has been buried so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Art Council of England and almost four months lived in a closed "Hope to be honest, I have a little overlooked my welcome" it seems to be nice to be true.
Rhodos had his days to investigate the victorian "new" closure, to look at the archive and to study the many shame and curiosity of the slopes, such as the mounted hyene heads on the walls and the flames that had carried out in the grain for centuries.
He walked through the landscape and the ruins of the old bourgeo and spoke with farmers, gardens, and sometimes with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book.
Then, the night he started "Whiskey and began to write."
The intime history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust had received the full access of 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes found a decade later, the employees just started to care for the archive that he was called "highs of years in which Aristocrates said "Oh, put it on the dawn."
Daybooks, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards, which show that whose meaning was: "I could say that land conflicts would be slow," Rhodes says, "but there was a birk to fight the two families.
You guys, let all go his gang!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the Burg as a start point to go to the English history, including 'The Labourer', who follows a man who allows the newly built bourgeo to connect to the farmer's residence of 1381.
"There is a record of a 1380-year-old trace, in this book with the title 'Knightly Familys of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.
"The farmer's resurrection began in this area, and I thought a stand is a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are shocked in the history of the slopes - such as 'The Priest', who tells the history of Jesuiten Paters, who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English reform.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the Smuggler Arthur Darrell was represented from the 18th century, who sent his own assembly by filling a snake with stones (a discovery that was made the first year later when his snake was slaughtered).
The Darrells are the Rhodes' Love Family of Scotney: "The masters seem to be very guests, always make a debt again and earn for things they couldn't give up.
Other generations of Darrell men resolved their debt crisis by marrying rich old women - I put them as a shock of good-specific kids, with a talent to shoot them."
After the end of its use in the closure, Rhodes is in the search for other unique writing experiments
He took a double-week residence in the Finnish wilderness for a Comic Roman on lifemaquek, the end of a Sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was re-educated from nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was worried to go back," he said.
It was like, "Ah, now I have to be done again with the sweet life."
Campagne launched: Over 300 years of old Marien capelle in Rāndorf
With the celebration of the 301 years of old Marien capelle in Rāndorf, the town of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new showmark.
On Saturday until Thursday, Master Otto Neuhoff and his Marketing Team on Nelson Artz will be secret to the logo and slogan.
Finally, in August, it should be given a fix on the island of Grafen 値h as a high point of campaign.
"It's nice for us.
Or?", the machines of the action since yesterday ask on the places at the shift capelle.
"We think it (no matter!) isn't really," they write on their eight-free website.
"or we use this measure to win your attention.
And to make clear that some are better than it seems.
On the basis, we are strongly convinced that we know as Bad Honnefer citizens about the beauty and attractiveness of our town very well."
In the action it goes over more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it means continue.
"It is applicable to formulate a single promise, one that presents an unchanged single setting character."
Finally, they are in competition with other communities.
A mid-five-five amount is possible to cost the town Bad Honnef its new showmarks and campaigns.
Army Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear against the army
Every year, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) stays on pensions and transports in the officers.
Like this week.
At first, a normal process.
But nothing is rutin with the Turkish forces a year after the shooting.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the general table as previously, but at the Department of Ministers.
At the debates, the five Vice-Presidents, as well as the Minister for Defence, Internal, Justice and External Affairs, took part in the Chair of the Governing Body.
This was the overwhelming number of civilians in YAS.
The government is in the army swinging the wheels.
General head Hulusi Akar remains in the office, but the commander of the soldiers, the air forces and the sea were stopped.
Since the deceased Coup, Head of State 169 of 326 generics and admiryles has been shocked.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the numbers of army - mostly because of appropriate connections to move the Exil Prediker Fethullah Gülen, which is seen by the Erdogan as a draughter of the powder.
Without 486 persons who should have been directly involved in the swimming investigation, they are negotiated in Ankara since this week.
On the day after the Putsch, Erdogan called the survey "Gotts gift", since he gave him the opportunity to purify the forces to "completely purify".
But did Erdogan really have the army in the griff?
In the end of February, the newspaper "Charlie" published a article with the title "Inconsistent in the Headquarter of the Military".
In the general table, it was concerned by a growing "Islamization" of the army, which, inter alia, demonstrates in the restraint of the head-in-law ban for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
The great cleaning machines in the army and the security forces are in any case.
In the midst of July Erdogan fired further 7395 state ministers, including 2303 police and 546 soldiers.
So it looks like Erdogan has joined the army.
The generals were older than the real rulers of the country.
Three times they put their role as guards of the world State.
After his election 2002, Erdogan turned the military force to step up, not lastly under professional vocational training to the reform requirements of the European Union.
The former officials say that Erdogan's triumph is a Islamization of the forces.
In the Magazine "Vocal Europe" a non-noise officer who was looking for fear of persecution in the Foreign Asile, the Turkish army will be "complete extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If this is the case, such development could not let Nato cold.
There is no doubt in the Alliance after the pursuits of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational capacities are "weakened", says Nato diplomates.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
It will be given a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
He intends to spend the legal immigrants a year by 500,000 per year, more strict rules for the obtaining of Visa for a timely work permit and restrictions for family-oriented visa.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft legislation should be discussed in the two chambers of the Conference.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase losses and currencies for tax payers, and it will be done by the United States to change the way as the citizens from other countries of Green Cards will be issued."
The law will prevent the channel migration and replace the current system.
This new demand process will be welcomed to the candidates, speaking English, which have the financial resources to support themselves and to demonstrate knowledge that will come to our economy", said Trump, quoted by the American media.
The Ministry wants to cure strikes for renal steel
Once again, in the past months, the future of the retail increase has been struggled - now it must go quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is intended to be built on the marine road where the tourists run.
In order to ensure the future of residues, the Ministry of Transport must still start on the road in this year.
"If the decision to continue to order and cure the route Ilmenau-Rennurg, the country is condemned to this mainly important link for tourism", said the secretary of the transport state Klaus Squill on Friday.
The costs for the establishment of the road were around 2,5 million euros.
From this amount the country exceeded 75%.
The contract that the Shuttle is intended to be appointed in the future will now be finally agreed to the soil.
The Ministry and the South Thrown Railways are already agreed with the technical details.
"They are the driving plan which are dealing with vehicles used and quality standards", said Sweet.
The planned agreement between the Ministry and the Rail society will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
In this way, the retaining shuttle was regularly ordered on December 2017.
The rensize shuttle is particularly a skilled train connection between the swimming ilmenau and the renst.
In the past months, on the road of a pilot operation, it was tested whether the trails of sufficient many people are used to re-regulate them in future.
The road is also strongly constructive in parts.
The upset of sex robbers is real, and we should be worried about it.
As you thought that 2017 could not be disappointed, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robbers comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are now a great thing.
The Foundation for Responsable Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, the emerging professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and the FRR, we have to begin to take serious attention.
Customers can choose the eyes color of the robbery, its shape of the breast and the type of finger nagel.
"The people are pleasant about them, but the companies give all the amounts of it, and we will get them much more often," said Mr Sharkey at the publication of their new reports.
Modern sex pups have developed robots with a silicon hair that feels warm - with conscious human reactions reached by the artistic intelligence.
The user can also "accepte" according to his convictions and choose everything from the sight color of the robot over the shape of the breastwars to the type or color of his finger neck.
But it will be worried more, since many robots have the "persistence" that would look progressively like a stepford girl.
Modern sex powders have developed to robots with a silicone hair.
The realBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are found accordingly, such as shockness.
And then there are still the Roxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with planned personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which shares the impression of smoothness and "Wild Wendy" with a "abnormal" personality.
"Roxxxy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible", warms the website of True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has their smilings during the day, as well as real people!
She can be sweet to be fixed on conversation or may be "in smiling"!"
There are many incredible aspects in this increase of sex robbers - not tolerated because they replace real human relations - but the substantive women's properties, the impacts on gentleness when a step towards fresh (his this: opposing) Farrah is a threat to most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxy with a Vibrator, but for men.
"When women (sic) can have a Vibrator, why can men have no Roxxxy?" says on the website.
However, these sex robbers are not only a fetic or keep a different sex game.
Their expansion and growing rationality shows to something dark and deep in our culture, to a decline from the ideal equality of the sex to a desire by sex with subvention as optional assignment.
Most men, of course, will not keep sex robbers, and while the FRR observes their increased popularity, they remain promptly at the border of the consumption.
But what goes out of the border zones, it can be very less about the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not rare or political until the free market has the permission of them here.
There is a certain overcome that these high-developed sex robbers are at a time where women's rights are threatened to the worldwide, where there is a president in the white house who agreed to have sexually attacked women.
The most thrilling aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') are not the graphic images, the disappeared body and the cut eyes, but the realistic effect of this vision.
The Republic of Galaad is a spring, but now it does not seem to be a great speech.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical identity to real women as realistically as possible (if even with pornostar proportions).
Their constructors want to feel humanally that they follow the movement of a real body.
But, on the point when it's about their "privacy" robots don't make real women.
You can't separate from their companions or simply leave.
You have no communication or a background history, nothing that indicates about independence or anything that could cause the phantasie of total entrepreneurship.
Otherwise expressed: You are an afflicted slave.
Or to express it in the proof of 2017: Service Managers
Trumps' great performance?
He makes a mid-Romney involvement of healthy human mind
It has become a bi-sensitive of the Trump era that the political discrepancies that have polarised the United States' election have also shared families in a small format.
In the United States newspapers, on Christmas and Christmas, there were advice about how to do with the horror of Trump's people.
We're strictly strike all of us to let our filter legs plates.
More than noted is the power of Trumps to bring family together.
I win this because my cousin, a left-building dininger who lives in Chicago and has been busy with the Republicans in our family, has visited me this week in New York.
She recalled me that the unity may have a powerful effect against a common enemy.
With the Trump in the white house, everyone she knows, including the Republic of the Republic of the Republic, with which she had struggled for decades because of the policy, is suddenly and very similar on the same side.
For the stage, it is probably a good thing, but I am in a further connection that this also brings significant risks to us.
The left has been strengthened by the trumpet, but the decisive effect of his presidency has the strength to switch us all to the right.
If we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the great possibility that his masses will not be cut off any day.
However, there is a more terrible long-term scenario, in which the Trump Republican of the Right Flood "normalized" appears immediately in comparison with his standards than the inclusion of the punishment.
I found me today from an active nostalgia for the Middle Romneys' urcical version of the deceased - the dog on the autodach, which 14% income tax (or at least we knew how his tax statement was) - both in comparison with the Trump in fact a very mild criminal.
If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicns must only be spiritually healthy to qualify himself as an unexpected improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carussell in the Central Park, the largest of the Carussels of the New York Park Department, and the best $3 that you can earn in the city if you don't need coffee.
The horses are very large, the Fiberlas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are narrow and the animals turn up to view full fear of their own shoes - the extremely dark and the climing music gives it a wonderful way.
So many clergy of a city spend: the views of high buildings will be old to be trusted by the Skylines to offer a lot of surrenders, and the reality of the city will not be justified to the dream.
Fifty-third years later, and I'm still not going over the day when I found that Swiss cottage is not Swiss cottage - the theme Poub Ye Old Swiss cottage is not a large circulation in North London.
However, the Central Park-Carussell is still a rare magical experience, since there can be two years of age, 11-year-old, and two women in the 40s and all have a great time.
If I could evaluate the carussell, I would have given him the full number, but for luck no one asked for it.
On the other hand, in this week I was forced to evaluate my "exploration" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could take my credit cards.
In the coffee house at the edge of my road, it is the same, the option to compare the evaluation with a 15% drink payment - that is to buy something over the board.
This leads not only to a delay of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also requires pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where it is not necessary.
The poor woman in the shopping house was sweet, while I sweared the experience to make you rich my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with breast pain from prison in the hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit second time.
Last year, he was put to the hospital because of the treatment of snitchs to his handgels, which he is in the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after a appeal of the State lawyer against a first murder.
He killed the Steen Camp in the early morning hours of 2013, shooting them several times through a gate of the toilet cabine in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius said that he had his friends for a night invasion who hid himself in the kitchen.
State lawyers have announced their intention to present up against the six-year-old prison penalties of Pistorius Appell, which they say they are too careful.
The National Criminal Training Authority said that it would be entitled to the Supreme Court of South Africa and could be heard in this year.
Pistorius is risked that his punishment will be increased by 15 years when the lawyers are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a wonderful egg
As the last of the flowerer schools, the four-class clubs were left in the holidays and in the continued schools.
Three of the graduates are coming to the Gymnasium, four to the real school.
Leader Angelica Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental Citizenhouse in Epfenhofs at the service.
The 29 students of the four classes under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chosen a young adler who rises at the Headquarters, but then will be released to freedom.
To this end, the munteer shock made a musical with the title "The Adler in the Headquarter".
Bauer Arnold found a wonderful egg, and left it out of his dogs.
Instead of a hair coffee, a small adler came out.
But the hope to make a dog from him, the Adler wiped out on a high mountain his fleet out and flee.
Then, the three and four classes showed a hair dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The kids danced with the young gockles, the Cylinders, for the weight.
The Adler was for the Integration, said the Chief of School Angelica Sitte.
The juvenile is different than the other youths, however, listen to it.
But he will never be like a dog.
His determination is to be free.
She wanted every quarter class that he feeled accepted in his new school.
It was followed by the colleagues, the former school leader Michael Müller, who is always back to schools, and the parents.
The kitchen is now over, the class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
She left their students after two years of education only very unprecedented, because it was a really good time.
Finally, she was able to leave on the fourth classs.
To the end, all students had a song of summer time and holiday time.
Thus the children made great joy.
For the new school year, eight first classs have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested because of illegal camps in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, referred to in the television, was shared.
On the morning of 1 August, the police was arrested by a group of illicit persons, including the two Bulgarians.
At the same day, they were released during an investigation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have decreased control over the free camps and put every one who is found to remain in a place that has not been thought for this purpose is a major punishment.
The controls are continued during the entire season.
The Ministry said that the Court could punish a currency.
Software Updates for Cell Factory: What the interested ones now need to know
How exactly does the software update find?
Should the cell-factors participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
In this table, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Concern software updates have offered around 5,3 million cars.
They are to improve the comportement of emissions in the Euro5 cars and, in part, improve the euro 6.
Euro-4-thesels or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe offers reviews:
Is the new action binding?
No, the dealed software updates are voluntary.
"The obliging updates are only applicable for vehicles that have smell software", says Anja Smetanin.
The motor vehicle (KBA) has ordered their equipment.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced an immediate implementation in the next months, but not mentioned a precise date.
Daimler has informed to write every person concerned.
If there is no inspection, it will be completed in their framework.
How long would the circumstances be in total?
"Swer to say," means Smetanin.
The balance of the manufacturer's commitment and political pressure.
"When we have seen, the car manufacturers will not act for a long time on the environment."
How long should the update continue?
The restructuring itself may only take three to four hours in the workplace.
Time remands may be to get a date.
What do car drivers that do not drive auto from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Concert?
The ACE is expected.
Foreign producers would probably be carried out, so Smetanin.
Does it now threaten a massive price decline of Euro-4 automobiles?
The ACE fears it.
But even in the regions where driving bans are threatened.
In the rural room it has not been loss of value for older celestial.
The ACE is intended to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Description
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first price allocation under President Trump is intended to be politically.
One of the prices does not want to come from Protest.
LL Cool J (49) receives as first rapper one of the designated signs of the renamed Kennedy Center.

We make the city living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city construction Meister, takes place in the next year in pension.
The office is already written - however, appropriate applicants are rar.
Since 31 years, Wacker is a city-builder.
And the work still makes him a great joy as he shares in the press conversation.
He reports about dismissors, but also demanding tasks that were expected at his followers.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application meets the request profile.
The city is looking for an architect or engineer for the next time.
In this way, taking into account the regular duration of the proclamation, it is still enough for a processing.
Since Hasslach functions as under-building rights authorities for the administrative Community, the applicant must submit appropriate decisions.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they couldn't fill this, the citizens should take advice to Offenburg.
But citizenship is important to the city and it itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good operational climate and good motion between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in the office, some significant projects were gathered, returning to the waker with pride.
"We make the city lives", he is safe about the building office and his employees.
But in the future, there are also slow-scale projects on the agenda: the restructuring of the former Hucla Arenals and the Countries of the Holocaust are almost shocked.
The thirty-four bridges between Bollenbach and Steinach are renewed, even the stadium ring is still the subject.
Only the last one will be shooted with around 1,5 million euros to buche, "if we do right", the Wacker estimates.
"All things waited for good tasks on my followers.
The work here makes it fun."
Structured to be available for a large player of the city.
With Haslach's own building room and garden can be flexible on many right.
"That can move much," Wacker says, and the creation of the green plants is often pleasantly mentioned by citizens and visitors.
Since the old city is Single in thinking protection, it is important to "have an eye for what is rejusted", when new buildings are approved, the different city-building master is stressed.
The city's master's high responsibility.
He's Bauherr, "It's all over my table."
In care and coordination, it is possible to contain long-year employees: Markus Neumaier (hochbau) has been over ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tifbauer) for 15 years.
Also, that his follower remains long, he wants to say, "We're looking for someone who wants to really identify and remain with the place."
Because continuity is not only important for a good operational climate, but also for the further training of the city.
Those who want to exercise Roland Wacker should be able to present a closed study as a diploma or bachelor with architektur and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction law.
The city buildings are covered by high and deep construction, construction planning, basic business affairs, management of urban allies, urban manufacturing courts with building courts and farmers, and lower building rights authorities, including thinking protection.
Railways locked on directions: Southeast Railway locked
According to the police, the unknown murders had led the blue driving route from the Railway Translation in Leobener Street (B116) to the guidelines.
These were so strongly damaged that the nearby goods had to be held.
The investigators go out of two male murders and search for them since night hours.
Among the assault, the Witnesses were observed a rosar roler and a bicycle car.
"This goes far away from a wheel bubble," said the ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch to APA.
The murders or murders would have threatened themselves and also threatened the traffic.
In addition to the damage to the location, the installation, the delays and the costs for the shipping shipping shipping could also be adjusted to the deadlines of the train clients.
Overall, it is a "heritage" sum, said the speaker.
The damages were restored on Friday, which was able to be carried out on the South Railway without difficulties.
Only ten personal trains were defeated on Friday, two of them were the television.
The goods did not fall, but they had late.
According to the EBB speaker Christoph Posch, around 200 meters of supervision had to be extracted.
Isolators and mass were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to switch IBD (Independent observation disease)
Red meat and chocolate can smell for your digestion system like an alptspace.
But a new study precisely highlights the opposite: a diet that is rich of meat-based proteins and milk products, the symptoms of patients who can be able to cut out of attention.
The unheilable condition in the United States, which is around 1,3 million and in Britain 300,000, causes magnificent forces and floors, reverse or blue accidents, weight loss and extreme comfort.
While the interested people are normally able to measure meat and milk products to lift their symptoms, researchers found at the University of Washington that the essential amino acid of proteins is involved in developing immunities that promote a tolerant dark.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immunition in the darm patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to eliminate distortions are equipped by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without prejudice to hypothesis.
If the weight is too far in direction of distortion, it may result in an indentry disease.
Experiences have been found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune exists in museums that bring a certain bacteria into their indications.
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the stones of proteins - to solve the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the darm microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
More Tryptophan had the museums in their food, so more they had from these immunities."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuter and a rich stripophan food tolerant, less instinct Darmilieus, if the same system also works with humans.
The postdoctorian Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune that promotes the tolerance when she found that a group of studies had such cells, but another group of the same stage, which was separated, did not have it.
She summarized that the difference with the darmicrobiums of the skin - the Community of bacteria, virus and palms, which normally live in the magnetic darm trait.
The colds of the skin were sequented with DNA and there were six bacteria types found in the mouses with the immune, but without they missed at the shoes.
Museums were placed in a stern environment so that they failed a darmicrobium and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. Reuter and the immune.
To understand how the bacteria effected on the immune system, researchers L. reuters increased in a liquidity and then transferred small amounts of liquidity - without the bacteria - to uncommon immunities that were isolated by the moses.
The immune cells developed tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquidity, it appears to be a side product of the Tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 milk acid.
If the researchers doubled the quantity of Tryptophan in the feed of the mood, the number of these cells increased around 50%, but if the ryptophan values were half, the number of cells were slow to half the cells.
Dr. Cervantes-Baragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells as the museum, and that most of us L. reuters protect in our magnetic darm trails.
It is not known whether Tryptophan side products from L. reuster develop cells in people as well as skins, but defects in genes were found in people with insulin disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control distortions on the inside surface of the darm.
Positively, high tryptophane values in the presence of L. reuter can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Math bonded a "geny"
In Manchester United signed a "geny" with Nemanja Matic, he believed Jose Mourinho after the Mediterranean players had his debut against sanddoria.
The 40 million pounds signed by Chelsea began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last presession game, before the EUFA super cap against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the stop role, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were formed by populars.
However, Mathetic was excluded from the Blues' preparation tour and only made 45 minutes that Mourinho had to improve before the first League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a gene in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready before."
Besides Mathetic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in Aviva Stadium as Mourinho formed its start-XI for the start of the season.
The Independent acknowledged this week that Mourinho wanted three further new commitments, but he found that the club had already done a "fantatic work" to meet three of its four priorities.
"Thirs from four, thanks to the covenant," he added.
"I'll be happy if they get four of me, but they have made great effort."
Boeing "mal" Dreamliner in the sky
The US flight manufacturer Boeing has seen the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots fled from Seattle in the United States of Washington, but the division began to marquette in the US Michigan state and moved in the form of a triamliner over the United States, which are thousands of miles.
The action took 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screen, it was the form of a dreamliner.
The whole was a delay test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such an advertising.
So the number "787" and the "Boeing" logo was marked in heaven.
New Depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still a SPD chief, social democracy ministers always saw the elections with a certain concern to Berlin.
There was no shooting fire from the party centre, but no wine from the covenant - so the most important desire of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, the substantial change was changed.
Sither observed the workers from the Willy Brandt House with growing down the events in the SPD headquarters.
What education has been obtained from there since the beginning of the year, it would not be described in the approach.
It was deep.
And one after the other.
According to the surprising end of the Red-Green majority in Niedersachsen, the Federal CDP considers a general signal against coalition of SPD and Greens.
"This shows more: Red-Green can't simply register", said the Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editor network in Germany (RND).
The surprising group of a green Member has affected the Government of President Stephan Weil (SPD) in a serious crisis.
Five months before the Sunday's election, his red-groen coalition has lost so that its one-size mercy is to the opposition of CDP and FDP.
Michael Kellner, the Green Budget Director, called for the abstract of the Netherlands Green Deputy Elke Twesten to return your mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear false of the election will.
Each Twesten must immediately return its mandate," said the Federal Employees and the Green Chairman of the Greens to the editing network Germany (RND).
"But this can't be true," a SPD fighter spends when the new Job message reachs the central party on Friday.
Stephan Weil, SPD Minister of Niedersachsen, is there after the transfer of the green deputy Elke Twesten to CDI without its own government master.
It is the provision of a series of large and small crises in SPD ships.
And no one knows what happens next.
The mixers started with the unexpected unexpected clear decline at the Saarland Whale in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed the kids at his time.
After landscape in Schleswig-Holstein and North-Rhine-Westfalen will be different.
That was also - even though everything was clearly worse.
The retreat in how the SPD carried out to the monkeys that the Dusseldorf plate swimms up the party.
In the past weeks, the gangs remembered again.
Then, when they just got a new courage, the G-20 House came from Hamburg.
And with him, the next shooter came.
Major Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head, lost his nimbus in that weekend, because he stood in the Elbfilharmonia while burned his city.
And because he did all wrong in the crisis communication so that he could do wrong.
Since then, school is fighting for his political survival.
So now, Stephan Weil.
As regards the VW emissions and its role in the Supervisory Council, the Netherlands Minister has already been in the criticism for a long time.
My values of survey came.
Nevertheless, or maybe soon, because in the past weeks it has always been stronger to put in the bridge.
The efforts of the former civilian minister of Hannover to build his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the area of Martin Schulz.
They gave him as they talked to the stabilization of the party.
Now it could be the exact opposition.
This is because it does not take a debt to the participating part of the Netherlands green.
And there's no school.
At the same time, the gentlemen are trying to close their own lines.
Their angry is on the green, and in particular here on the abstracted parliamentary of Twester.
"It is essential and democracy, as Mrs Twesten makes its own carriage interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the partial links in the SPD Joint Day Group, the editoron Network of Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected as a direct candidate, but on the country list of the neighbouring Greens in Parliament, as the Netherlands Member continues.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Head of the SPD Joint Day Group, declares a "undemocratic Manufacturer".
"The election will was clear four years ago: people have made Stephan Weil to the President of the Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Netherlands's SPD as a spicet candidate to the federal day election, the RND.
"After the personal concerns of a future CDD Member, the outcome of the election is false," said Oppermann.
He asked to explain the background.
I want to know whether there has been more or has been continued orders of the CDU Niedersachsen.
Contributions for local carriage III
Those who want to cure their home in the years can first receive support from the country.
In this regard, Mr. Albert Schindler and three representatives of the STEG city development on midnight in receptions.
At the beginning of the information event, the Singdler once again turned on the event.
Since 1991, it has been granted in Sanctions Territories.
The Baden-Württemberg, in the Sanctions Area I from 1991 to 2004, has also received two thirds of the support sums.
In the Sanction Area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidiary was still 60 per cent.
The present sanctions are a "project of follow-up" - it is finally important to promote internal development, not only new building areas.
On 4 April, Karlssrue has received information that it will be given a sanction area III.
The contribution sum is 833 333 euros, with EUR 500 000 from the country, the rest of the Community receives.
How is the area of sanctions now emerged?
You will, so skiller, investigate where the "very old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role to improve the interests in the area planned.
Where appropriate, the borders could also be moved again.
The STEG agreed on the mid-woman Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzhmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the 'social city' programme, which would then be carried out in the framework of sanctions.
The key of the programme is the revitalization of internal cities, the improvement of living and work and maintenance and the development of infrastructure.
The measures would be objective, i.e. by base, to be carried out.
The sanitation area would finally be set as a standard.
The authorisation period for the aid shall take from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year, the recording would be implemented only once, in the context of which those involved in the Sanctions Area will be completed a questionnaire.
In November or December, the adoption of this Decision should be taken as far as possible to begin with sanctions in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then declared that each community should carry out the preab undertaking investigations.
It goes to evaluate and decide when it is sanized and in what way.
It will then include an account of sanctions in the basic book.
Pietzschmann will come again after receipts and make a picture of the situation, promise it.
Gotzel stressed that a significant success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
This is why there will be questions that are sent postally to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled with the end of the summer feasts.
The wide questionnaire is the "building and ground-based boggen" which, inter alia, is about the construction and sanctional perspectives.
In green questionbooks, the "budgetary and accommodation boxes", information can be made on size, distribution and residentials of a living room.
The blue "bogen" is only to be filled when the building is operated in business spaces.
However, it should be noted how Gotzel pointed out that a full questionnaire is not at the same time an application for aid.
Furthermore, restructuring measures are not promoteable.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the aids will work according to the "Find Principe" - who first comes, is worth first.
You can't reserve a subsidiary for later "reserve".
To the end, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to be "smackable" sanction for the present.
The British Trainer itself sets a microchip to come with a car movement in house and car
A British founder is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip to open his home door, to enter his office and even start his car with a hand move.
Steven Northam, 33, had planned the channel chip between daums and show fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals to simplify their lives with technology through its BioTeq company.
He was assembled with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant analist at Royal Hampshire Hospital Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implantation procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology distinguishes a cup and dog inplanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr Northam also wants to change the drivers in houses and cars so that they are compatible with the Chip, everything for a cost of 300 £ per lock.
The married father of one has now built home and at its BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the tax.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the tax numbers thousands
The decision of the White House to flee a marine slaughter to South Lawn for an event that led to the American manufacture in the last month costs taxpayers after the information of the military who left the TIME Magazine until 24.000 US dollars.
The green-wheat Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on Bord, was the heart room of the event on July 17, in the white house with American building programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and head officers of the White House, made a round round by products from all 50 States.
The in Connecticut prepared swimming shooting swimming pool was issued next to a chain of Maine, a fire shooting car from Wisconsin and a shooter from Mississippi.
The Office of the White House requested the presence of the Hubschrauber in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, about 36 hours before the Hubschrauder on the South Lawn, after the signs of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the Hubschrauber.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an uncommon event with high visibility", wrote the Commander of HMX-1 at the end of his event, the counterparty of the aircraft.
The news showed that the Hubschrauder took place on the South Lawn on July 17th to 7 p.m. for the event at 15:00 p.m. and remained as long as the race was slept between 18:00 and 21:00 p.m.
The note adds that if the flight should be delayed from the white house, it would require a second unit for the return.
The original aircraft was held during the event at the Hubschrauder while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time.
The TIME registered not clearly whether a second aircraft was finally required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees to use public property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1 asked whether the event could damage the determination.
"A question we put was whether it was a violation of Hatch Act and we were informed that this wasn't the case," the Commander wrote.
"Clearly if you're closed," the shocked commander answered.
The "Made in America" event was called by the White House as an official event and would not be closed by Hatch Act.
But official events also have political supervisions.
At the event, the President urged the reform of health reforms, which was in the Senate, and promulgated the efforts to comply with the Government's rules.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes, is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the travel.
But their use only for a photo-OP is uncommon.
Trump carried out an investigation in February when the President's flight carried out before his first campaigns in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is fully estimated by the use of the President flight by its transactions.
"The White House is shocked by the "Made In America" show - the products from all 50 countries that are produced by American employers with American materials", said the Chairman of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 equipment often run training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn in order to reduce the US Chairpersons in the white house with precise centimeter lines.
When the Trump was early July on the G20 meeting in Germany, HMX-1 carried out in the white house 58 surroundings.
The aircraft for the "Made in America" - Ereignis counted with the training requirements for the month, said a officer.
Helikopter units moved 11 hours further to this day for "No Presidency support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers were overlooked the last for none of the other reserves presented at the event.
A speaker of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in posting the Hubschrauder on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not support budgets for the President's flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event.
According to the timelines of the United States Defence Minister for the financial year 2017, however, the DoD Refund rate for VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hours.
Signs of the unit mark the flight time in 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the real costs for the operation of the slaughter are far below this rate.
"The costs for taxpayers to be fixed on the basis of estimates for refund rates are highly irrelevant," said Walters.
"The estimates contain staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual resources."
According to a RAND study in 2015, the refund rates for DoD are not the staff costs, but take into account the costs for vehicles, maintenance and contracting.
At that time, Sean Spicer, the former preachers of the White House, defended the use of the Hubschrauber for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week, which are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Federal Connecticut are very proud of contributed to our national security, and I am going to say that hundreds of thousands, even if thousands of people are depending on it.
And I think the majority of the Americans are all proud of the hamburgers and other military equipment, for which so many Americans have worked unreasonablely.
Of course, it is appropriate to highlight it."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the Hubschrauder when he took his round over the South Lawn for the event, but he was placed in the driving room of a fire shooting car.
In the white house, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and struck with the media about his own fleet of firm products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of it."

How Americans of the OMV may harm
In fact, Donald Trump did not work when he put his sign under the law on the consolidation of the sanctions against Russia at midnight.
"In his hate to adopt the law," the Congress enpacked a few "constitutional rules".
The reaction of Moscow was so hard as expected, and even Brussels was shocked against the U.S. race.
The draft aims to punish European enterprises that help Russia to build gas pipelines into the EU.
Indeed, seven investors of the home OMV, which are funded together with other European companies, are concerned with the construction of the Russian East Sea Guide North Stream 2.
The Drohcules are powerful.
However, it is too early for assessing the consequences, so the official statement of the oil concentration.
Indeed, Donald Trump itself should have the sanctions still to live by executive order.
Twelve weapons are on his choice.
"The Press" has been looking at who the concerts could shoot and who could really hurt him.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Paul Escobar, the Cali Cartel is cut into the middle point of Netflix
Despite the second stake of Narcos, Paul Escobar's killer, the series of Netflix is still not over.
The stapels three and four were already confirmed by the Streaming Service, which first received their first trailer and showed the latest badness of the show.
With the third stage, the DEA has focused on the most rich organization of the world's drug trafficking: the Cali card.
Introduction of four powerful patents, they operate "come a continuous-500 companies" only with more state tests and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the card, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) orders the mexican connection, and Chef Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Peter Pascal returned as Javier Peña, the guy who invites the American and Colombian criminal persecution authorities to support the war against drugs.
Additional players are Mattias Varela, Michael Stahl- David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third staff of Narcos will start on 1 September.
Role back: The city provides 46 kitchen supports
The city is organizing our midst at once again.
With firm conversation partners for children and an adjustment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban kidday places.
On 1 September, the town of Krefeld is overcoming the food supply in the urban child day facilities (Katies) in own region.
For Sonja Pommeranz, astronome leader in the area of juvenile aid, it's a good news: "We all have been very pleased."
Buy is still out of the house: a Caterer takes this task and delivers fresh shopping.
The city is located in the Crefelder area 46 childrenday places, in 44 children receive a warm food time at midday time.
In the past November, every 2800 children were at the bathroom, and the need to grow steadily.
"Methodless children are not only employed for 45 hours in which we are at midday," explains the pommerance.
"The offer is also applicable in the 35-hour reception when children stay up to 14 hours."
46 part-time forces have cooked service since 1 September: they warm the foods provided, complement them for salt, raw cost and fruit, portion the food time individually, give the food, swimming, and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly administered to us," says Pommerance.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven group institutions - is decided over the hour.
"The kitchen helpers now belong to our team," says Pommerance.
"They are so stronger connected and it is more simpler to implement pedagogical concepts."
For this is also: healthy food and cooking.
"The children should help to prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is sensitive.
And for the kids.
"They have a well-known power in us, a person who is trusting them, and not permanently changed."
This continuity is important for children.
The removal of our rooms - as well as the kitchen forces - will be done in the future by special cleaning personnel.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also shown the charm that it has shown in comparison with the cost of the city's own and foreign loan as the most economic, it is from the press seat.
And it is, although 46 part-time forces are re-installed.
“After these hours, about 750 people in the education area have not been so strong,” says Sonja Pommeranz.
The Afghan Democracy depends on the political role of women, says UNO
Elections can only be representative if all members of the society, including women, play a role, said the Chief of the UNO Mission in Afghan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, director of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidated to the Council's elections in the provinces; three women are candidates to the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered electors are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said at midnight in a statement.
The elections can only be really representative and credible if women participate unlimitedly and are included in all parts of the election process.
The Afghan elections for the Province Council and the Presidential elections are held on 5 April.
The Talibans have published threats against a election process, which are assembled with the transition of international combating negotiations.
In this year, elections will first be transmitted to the power of peace by a democraticly elected government towards the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan independent election committee reports that 1.2 million women of totally registered 3.6 million elections were registered.

GMB concern about investments in the McVitie Fabric in Glasgow
A workshop wants to make aware of the long-term obligation to produce in their work in Glasgow in the Biscuit Manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said that the company has succeeded in the future of investments in the Tollcross Statistics.
More than 500 employees are working in the work, which makes other products with Hobnobs and Rich Tea Keakse.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than 5 million pounds in the past years.
He added that employees and employees would "research as first" if they change their activities.
In a letter to the branch officer of the company, GMB Scotland McVitie's requested to express "remember that the financing for modernization of production lines will not be undertaken."
GMB Senator-organist Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we can win from the general site manager no clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross, we are deeply concerned with our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the workforces are strongly focused on the local community and the largest Glasgow, a major scale for human unemployment in a area with high unemployment and social participation.
It is therefore necessary under the perspective of jobs, loans and welfare, and in front of the brexit, the increased living costs and the chronic production decline, the eastern end of the glasgow is urgently a floring production price at McVitia."
A speaker of Pladis said: "The filial at Tollcross has received a letter of GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly, since we appreciate the continuing commitment to workers and employees.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB advisers at Tollcross two months ago, where some questions were openly discussed.
We have discussed with the employees that we, like all companies that are active in a extremely competitive and insecure economic climate, continue to review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and places - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested in our Tollcross stadium more than 5 million pounds, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site full and complete. If our operational departments are changed on the location, the employees and their partners will be the first to learn this."
Did the PSG Barcelona warned Neymar three years ago?
The page of La Liga may be interested in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain is not left in her persecution of Neymar after she has issued a offer of 189 million £ to solve its release class, but they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world's reception accident?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, since the Ligue 1 club is ready to cut the world record over more than the double of the previous brand, while Paul Pogba returned to the last season of 89 million pounds to Manchester United.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most precious players in the world and the highest payest professional sports in the world. PSG offers delivery from more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry about how Neymar has tried his way out, although a source near the Catalonian Presidency is that the club has always given his best to care for him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But the football world was warned by the President of the PSG three years ago?
When Manchester City 2014 interested in signing Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any agreement that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be opposed to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have overwhelmed this line, expressing the Spanish agreement in the beginning of this summer interest in the PSG media player Marco Verratti.
The PSG cleared that they would not permit it to the international from Italy to defeat any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.

Interview: "Domspatzen report loaded by Papst-Broder Georg Ratzinger"
The Regenburger Domspatzen report on the falls of consumption dealt with Papst Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means the author and historical Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the missing channel at the Regensburger Domspaths continues to be discussed.
Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement "We are Church," explained after publication towards the German Press Agency, he expected from the former Regensburger Bischof and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, and by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the priest Benedikt XVI.
It would serve very much to the view of the Catholic Church if the mullers and Ratzingers expressed their deep regrets about their own submissions or their infringement at the time.
However, the Vatican newspaper "Osservator Romano" criticized that the report on violence was measured with "two measurement".
With regard to the transactions in Regenburg, no one doubted that it should be handled on "strange and devastating acts", which should be punished and hindered in the future; however, it is the "Grad Medialer Manipulation", as the author Lucetta Scarafia, historic and member of the national Italian Bioethic committee.
“The habitat to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the daily survey and prepares the public view to keep the normal," writes Scarafia.
Pristin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bayeric Rundfunk: "It is pleased to go to the church, and it's a fresh found."
She also pointed out that in her youth, "sweet a very normal pedagogical means", "to be ready with fresh children as I was one."
She's starting to apply today's standards to the previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on malnutrition, Papst-Bruder Georg Ratzinger was often dealt with.
The author and historic Michael Hesemann, who met Ratzinger the memory group "My brother of the Papest" (traduced in 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratgingers," said Hesemann, "if all this had nothing to do with him," he values the results of the final report.
What is exactly in the 440th report submitted by a lawyer Ulrich Weber by the Bistum Regensburg?
Overall, 547 Regensburger Domspats passes were severely misused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high optimisticness, 67 domspatzen sexually.
The final report states to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regenburg from 1964 to 1994: "Truely, it is possible to observe that, in many cases, the Domkapelmaister R. has been applied physically and psychical violence in many cases.
The punishment for students could also be more stronger when high emotion.
Nevertheless, in contrast to many other accused persons, many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore binding in many cases even positive memorys with him."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the missing channel at the Regenburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was dealt with with his view.
Mr Hesemann, the 440th page report on the "Feats of Violence Exercising to Protection Commands at the Regenburger Domspatzen" provides an opposite image of Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For a lot of students, he has his "mankind".
On the other hand, he also appears as cholerator and perfectionist, who was hand-made when a domspath was not able to bring up.
How do you appreciate this final report as his biograph?
Michael Hesemann: If you are making the efforts and the whole 440 pages report from the previous to the back, you must ask yourself more about why the name Georg Ratzinger is going to be there.
He is just eight pages covered and is clearly free of any suspect of the media or media in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
In addition, violence exercises at the pre-school were outside its effects.
In any case, you can propose to learn to late or have not taken sufficiently seriously.
The Doms patzen gymnasium, in which he worked, was recommended by practically all persons as - so sensible - "Resolution", "Himmel" and "better world".
Thus the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also expresses an excellent witness, describes it as "heat", "heart", "respectful", "competence" and "comprehensive" as extremely good teachers, who used the boys regularly with kitchen, kitchen and bonbons and "forever converted into traubs of children".
Only a minority is estimated about his perfectionism and its high emotions, which have already led to whines.
That he was not only with shoes and was the key connection on the ground, but also distributed ears, and moved too fresh young men to the hair or ears, he had already given himself a year ago, deplored and apologised for it.
However, it must be said that such education methods were widely distributed in the 1960s and 1970s, in parents as in teachers.
Do you also know such a kind of authorisation methods?
Of course, I think each of us, who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a world school, a state gymnasium.
In comparison with what is actually in this report, namely the decisive sexual abuse and violence in the pre-school, are free bagatals.
There is already a question of whether it is not better with his knowledge and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media just struck on him.
Many who have never understood him still work in the Bayerian pope are still quiet.
However, the truth is: the report dealt with Georg Ratzingers in every consideration!
In the media, the report was very much reported on the subject of misuse in the Regenburger Domspatzens.
Does Georg Ratzinger, in the final report, also have any development or mediation in terms of sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: It is clear.
No one of the 67 victims of sexual offences claimed to have confidence to the Dom Capital Chief.
Not even the parents were instructed.
"I never thought to talk to my father or my mother," said one interesting person, "It was all very painful to me. "
The real problem in the declaration of sexual abuse was, but the majority of victims were shocked.
If they did not even trust their parents and sisters, then nor would they have been a chairman who would have been a colleague of the murders.
How do do domspatzen students assess the role of the advisors in the case of malnutrition?
Michael Hesemann: A questionnaire student made it like this: "Only sexual abuse... I see... no case he had had been able to have knowledge of the time and could have stopped the murders.
I think it is ... too absurd to accept that it is being calculated to him... skins have opened more incredible or clearer or even more than against their parents, internal leaders, teachers of trust, etc.
That is talking to him about sex...
The report comes to the very clear result: "It could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation that students and/or students concerned in the preceding area."
As regards sexual abuse, georg adviser is to be free from every publicity.
Thus, he can't be predicted not to prevent or have brought him to show.
Therefore, there is no reason to connect his good name to this present crime, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media it was to read a lot of "Govertexes" at the Regenburger Domspaths.
The previous Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger will be proposed in the report "View."
He's supposed to live with this prosecution?
Michael Hesemann: This is the great problem that in the reporting everything was missed and was mixed into a huge medium of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of Georgi Ratzinger.
But exactly this is a misuse of the report.
In fact, it will be clean: between the school and the gymnasium of domestic paths, between sexual abuse and violence, and one thing, we say, other forecasts.
In addition, the report discusses events since 1945, and also from four decades where Georg Ratzinger was not chairman of the Domspatzens.
The whole horrible shoes, the cases in which kids of sadist teachers were regularly scanned and shocked and shocked, were all in the pre-school in the east houses and piles courts, where they have really had to rule scanded situations.
But with whom Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he had the boys only faced when they were on the Doms patzengymnasium.
It was, as the most important witnesses highlighted, the subject "forschool" tabu.
You were only happy to get away and so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What else was on Doms patzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: Despite the domination of disciplin, there was no sadistic violence.
And this applies also to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "will many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories with him".
That's the highest remains the provision to have been shocked.
However, in spite of all efforts, the report was only able to define two periods of time in which it was reported by the situations in the pre-school.
The first time in 1970/71, when he began to evacuate and from the operations at a school where he was not effective and responsible, (as the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then back to 1993.
Did georg advisers result in the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because he has already written a letter to the Director of Doms patzengymnasium that has even reproduced the report.
In this regard, he pointed out that "this will continue to practice the punishment in the pre-school".
In view of the risk of negative press publications, he recommended urgent adjustments.
Of course, it was at a time when legal clarity was forbidden in Bayern for a long time.
They were in a legal grain zone, as everyone knows.
It was also difficult for him to consider where the interested persons may have overcome or dramatized and where they really exceeded the permitted borders.
But you can't even say that he had always been shocked.
That's just not true.
First in 1980, the punishment of schools was also officially abolished in Bayern.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis stated that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical measurements to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We're historical speaking about "Fall strike of Anachronism", so the danger to evaluate the past according to current moral standards.
There's no right the princess.
But of course, this is not for sexual abuse, which was deceived at all times, and not for what was interrupted in the school of resistance and violence to innocent children, which is far beyond the employees at the time.
It's all horrible, and I'm glad that it's finally worked.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg's advisers, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means for discipline and punishment, such as ears and hairs and ears, were widely distributed in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then prohibited, he has also remained strict.
What image of his Regenburger time has georg Ratzinger given you in the conversation with the book "My Brother of the Papest"?
How was the subject of punishment in the language?
Michael Hesemann: Now, in the book it's about his brother Joseph’s life, so papa Benedicts XVI., reports of his perspective, where the Domspatzen played only a side role.
However, I don't know any way he had a strict regime there.
However, it must also be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demanders of unrequired discipline, it would have been unlikely to be possible from the most known national regensburg domspatches to form an institution of a worldrang, the true cultural messages of Europe and its musical tradition, both in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With Kekens and Bonbons alone, you do not ever make great songs of opposite boys and have a success before each area, but always disciplinary, suffering and self-training.
How many people have you experienced georg Ratzinger at the conversation with their book?
Michael Hesemann: With the work at the book and further, I have really learned Georg Ratzinger well and always again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believers and discreet people who are not able to imagine that he could only do something to be a flight.
I regularly agree with how many former domestics still today, 23 years after his emergency, keep regularly contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him until today that he was strict to them are clearly in minority.
Most doms passes are grateful to him today for the expansion of their life and the world of music closed them.
And that he always was a good, parent teacher - a more strict father, certainly it may be - but he was also a lovely respectful person to whom they still look up and honor them just today.
And please again clearly: everything you're doing to him is educational methods that were then at the agenda.
We can be happy that we have overwhelmed this time for a long time.
But it is the most unjust to a man, just because he is prominent and a brother has a more prominent to make a medium-sized sinbow.
There's the wicked desire that is in it just to be obvious.
Because the report, which was just published, deplores him.
Now the state of a 93-year-old man who has purchased great services and without the outside Bayerns and perhaps even Germany would not be aware of the Regenburg Domestics.
