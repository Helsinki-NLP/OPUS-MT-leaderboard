Triumph of the legal populations in Austria, totally 29%
The first preliminary results of the election of parliamentary elections from Sunday in Austria have been a decisive weakness of both parties of the great coalition and a clear strengthening of the legal populationist parties.
In particular, the Austrian People ' s Party (EVP), where the position of the previous President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the chippe.
On the contrary, the election leader of the Bureau for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Countrier Landesuptmann Jörg Haider, is a triumphal return to the federal policy.
As a result, the social democracy (SPUE) remains with 29.8% of the most stronger power in the country, however, with the last elections in 2006, it loses 5,5% of the votes.
More badly, the SAVP is losing by 25.6% by almost nine percent of the voices.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian war history, and especially at the People's Party, which had requested the previous elections, this is a real catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the AVP was out of the coalition, the People's Party had a clear pretension before the SPEC.
But the electioners probably have punished the parties to disrupt the government.
Soon in the first responses to the results, speculations were made about a possible delay of the participant and previous vice-cancer Wilhelm Molterer.
The observer believes that this may already be on Monday at a extraordinary meeting of the Party's headquarters.
Such development would probably be the way to the most likely way out of the election debacle, so that it would be a renewing of the great coalition from SPE and OPP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-populist parties, 18% of the freedoms (FPUE), BZÃ 11% of the votes, the social democratics, but at the same time, expressed their fear that 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party with the Popularist Debates (when the FPUE was still unilateral, in 2005 it was taken from the BZÖ) towards a common government, which had even called sanctions from the European Union.
It is clear that Jörg Haider, who already explained that he was ready to cooperate with each party and go back to Vienna in the Austrian federal policy.
The European Parliament also entered the green party, but the light losses and decreased from the third to the fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party probably has measured the four-per cent terms, and therefore it did not go into Parliament.
Blackzeberg: Relations with India can be deleted
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Tschechian scientists who were accused of the illegal collection of cows in India, it could be considered by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Karel Schwarzenberg, to a certain decay of the Czech-Indian relations.
This stressed the Minister in New York after the meeting today with his Indian official Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then it will be a certain decay", he explained after a meeting that took place at a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said, after the discussions, the executives could only be difficult to take into account.
Nevertheless, he argued that, in the case of Petr Švacha, who was released by the appeal and received a currency of money, the Central Government would want to do so with the local government in Dardjiling, in which law practices.
"It could be cleared by his problem," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced for three years of freedom punishment, it would be Mukhardshi's opinion as the best if he was going to work at a higher instance.
He could ask for free exemplary and wait for his sentence, as the Minister.
Blackberg confirmed that his partner was expressed in negotiations.
"He recommends a profession at a higher court, then comes in question for him", said the Chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can be involved in all the matters is to enhance the judges 'competent legal support', the Indian Minister has engaged in.
At the same time, he said that such assistance will already be offered through the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in receiving good contacts with India who have a long-term tradition.
The Inders also give it to it," leaded Blackzeberg.
At the same time, the Czechian Press Agency switch to its partner, the Czech Republic has contributed to a great importance in the problem of entomologs in Czech.
"We really hold it for a great mistake to arrest and arrest these Tschechian scientists," he explained.
An answer to the question whether he has received the appeal from the Indian side to address the matter, the Minister will declare.
"I was already promised," he only realized.
A Czech drives through the ring around the sea
It is involved in an electronic map on Australia and the border zones.
However, it is not the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with her the cross-border sea ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says the Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-first worker of the United Nations Division for Oceans and Sea rights.
His head, the Director of Division, the Czech Jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it.
This is the ruling of work and enthusiasm.
The sea ground is a little known world, which is rich of natural sources.
Here it is to find terrestrial oil, the extensive era and other non-created substances, but also for a long time unknown organisms, which, for example, put the key to the development of a medicine against cancer.
A sea background, greater than the Festland
Today the Anrainers states have reported their right to the new marine areas.
Indeed, after a United Nations Convention, they use their rights in which they joined themselves in Jamaica in 1982.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shoes, often up to hundreds of miles far from the east of a country to the sea.
This country has, according to the Convention, an exclusive right to all sources of the continental ships.
"Small expression, as a continental shield is considered the part of the sea ground and its soil, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
He exceeds the borders of the Lake Sea, often the borders of twenty-four miles of the so-called economic zone," says Mikulka.
The application submitted by the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental ship shall be undertaken by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation work.
One of our tasks is to provide the Commission legally and specially technical support.
The Commission has already negotiated five applications, such as Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Up to now only the three last countries have succeeded", adds Mikulka.
At an international echo recently the success of Australian, which was able to significantly increase its marine areas as the first country.
However, the New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the sealand that has been obtained by the Commission last week is about 1,6 million square kilometers, which is about six times more than the size of the real state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the research.
The wine that will be made to them in the future from the use of the sealand will have an unprecedented value.
Other States will also slowly submit their applications.
They can do this ten years since the moment they ratifie the "contract of Montego Bay".
There, where the continental shelf ends, the territory of the ocean land that is called by the Convention as "common heritage of humanity".
There is no State any more speciality in here.
The right to promote in this area is a international institution established by the Convention.
"The sealand is no golden grain," said the Director Mikulka, and adds to which "all areas are legally defined and treatedly infected by the system."
Czech in the Pacific
A part of the sea ground today belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares him with other States of the former Eastern Block in the context of the Joint Interocean Metal Organization.
This has been obtained in 1991 because of the Convention, as well as the investors of some other countries less than, the status of a "training investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the Clarion Clipperton Zone in the Stille Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to investigate by the investor is something greater than the former Czechoslowakei.
The sea ground is attached there, it is a type of tatra on the sea.
"Promotions can be found on a surface of total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The region is a rich foundation centre of polymetal concretions which includes Nickel, Kupfer, Kobalt and Mangan," says another jury, the Inder Pakshi Kings.
The macedonic employees of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concrete as a pattern.
She remembers a small cardfold or, with something of phantasie, to the deceased shom that shocked the legend to the Golem to life.
German special forces were at the location of the Jesel release.
The Egyptian government had requested assistance from Germany to solve the Jesel crisis - the experts came.
When seriously, the special units were ready, but they did not.
For the conditions of liberation of 11 Egyptian tourists, more details are known.
The rescue action was also indirectly involved in German special forces according to the details of the Defence and Internal Ministry.
As a result, both federal specialists and GSG 9 were the flight staf of the Federal Policei, the Federal Criminal Law and the logistics of the Technical Assistant work on the place of release.
However, as the speakers of the ministers continued to share on Monday, the German forces did not need because they left their prisoners and fled when they recognized signs for a violent release.
The Egyptian government adopted the aid offered by Germany to connect them as local support forces.
"This has not been happy," said one speaker of the Federal Ministry.
The travel group of the five Germans, five Italians, one Romanians and their eight Egyptian attendants in the southern Egyptians on September 19th.
After the launch in a wilderness area in the south of Egypt, the crowds were cut into the border between Egypt, Libyan, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the sealers remained unclassified until last as well as the details of the release or possible loss payments.
The devices have arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated shoes are in the obhut of the German message.
For details of the release, he did not express himself.
There was no information first in Berlin when they return to Germany.
According to the "image" allocation, the five vacants and the special forces should be shocked with a air bus bus of the airwaffe and take place on Tuesday in Germany.
US Representative budget refusal of saving package
The first chamber of the United States Congress has made the $700 billion serious saving package for the financial markets all right.
The Dow Jones was out in the depth.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US Representative has rejected the Government's relief package for financial markets.
Despite all appliances by President George W. Bush and the leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the programme that the Chaos should be deemed to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the preferences were doubtless trying to convince the critics a serious package of $7,7 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiations leaders, called the deputy, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," said he.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones introduced more than six percent or about 600 points.
It was reasonable that the investor was worried that the State saving package could disappear.
He recalled himself just before the end of the vote, to then, after the complaints of the slaughter, to disrupt again.
Experts now receive more serious turbulences on the international financial markets.
The adoption of both the House and the Senate is necessary for the entry into force.
Answers contain increased booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travel events:
In travel bookings for the next months, the surgeon is significantly increased in comparison with the previous year, according to a study, for the winter season even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak conjuncture visions, the German travel loss of a study remains unexpected.
In the winter season bookings, the travel offices reported an over 31% over the previous year period, as the German travel association (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
The GfK market research institute has already been investigated for the first month of reserve numbers.
Thus the overwhelming increase of the travel offices for October around 11% compared to 2007, the DRV was divided.
Based on these results are GfK's numbers, the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel offices and higher for the total market.
The travel books were carried out until August 2008.
In particular, because of the weak dollar course, travels were asked to the United States, the DRV shared.
Here, the booking increase is around a third.
Moreover, Spain, Turkey and Greece, and the home fillings with German travel objectives.
In particular, high-scale skins in the course, President of DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increased costs for energy and food, the costs are "for customers better calculable than for individual holidays".
Consumers could, inter alia, evacuate from early books or all-inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
Even the summer months were very well prescribed, so that the past year will be re-exampled - although another study states that the number of Germans who have taken a journey is closed compared to the previous year.
My first time October Festival
Ballermann-Apris-Hits in the endless drive, beer from liter clothes and promis in designer dinners.
A Wiesn-debut.
Susanne Zucker and I haven't really much together.
She's a blond, television-moderator and takes a sweet dirndl.
I've got dark hair, I'm student and my clothes are second hand.
One thing, however, connects us: I'll get three minutes on the Wiesn, the photos are already cut up on us and snipped the memory cards - very sweet and that at my first review visit.
That's how you get friends.
The Bill-Dirndl seems to have its purpose.
As Visn-Touri and actually north of the white wood stactor, the welfare felt in the light until date in borders.
But once I came to the Theresians, it's half so bad.
Fast everyone takes dirndl or leder hoss; no one looks opposed or painfully touched - everything is totally normal.
Strange views in the Scochobanian stadium only remember my shocks.
One muncher notes me that I had been wrong linked to the shoes: "Links is free, Middle Youth, forgive me right, down there."
Homely, I'll smell my clothes from behind to the left.
"Passt," said and laugh.
Others make less approximately to subtle flat techniques and bring slow filths on which "To drunk to get clothes!" stands and strikes a swimming swimming snack.
The young man with the exhibitionist acts named Bob, come from England and visits first time the October Festival.
He finds it "gorgeous" with a long "ooooo".
That he told me that after he completed his predominant measure.
Right next to one of these hydraters, from which everyone thinks he's a muller.
Bob is one of the favorite "Wildbyslers."
Others do not have the happiness to remove alcohol in this way.
On the eighth end, healthcare walks in sharp over the set that must care for the poor shooter.
The nurses are always on the roof - every four times a overwhelmed tragedy of Zelt to Zelt.
This works as with most Wiesn users: empty back, full back.
Who's in the Promille Targ under the plan isn't seen.
"These are the places where goarnmmers are packed," one of the healthcare called to ask and disappeared in the grain.
Name of the victim known by the police
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital after she was entered in Essex was known.
Carole Paulson, living in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday on Shenfield Road in the city mission.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital House in Romford, but later he died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspect.
In the meantime, he was released to battle.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizontal
For a long time before Turkey tried to participate in the European Union, the European forces were interested in deepening the Turkey's border.
On the east side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the most deceased relics of this chastised, caiser.
The Hydarpasha Railway was established by the two German Architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance Style.
This is at least what the travellers tell you.
The building is situated at the end of the railway with a tour on every edge of the front side and looks like a provincial German Council house.
The stone is crazy.
The whole building is slow
But once you have been in the trail card switch, there is no doubt about the inheritance of the project whose western access was.
The Bahnhof was opened by a German consortium, the Anatolian Bagdad Society in August 1908.
Germany, who was a past traveller in the imperialist game, had to be implemented before his ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a trail connection to Damaskus, Bagdad, and further after what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany’s imperialist projects were raised during the first world war.
His rail ships were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its Arabians.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, produced by the unconquerable borders of the cold war, is lost.
The British forces turned out of Egypt and put the Turks and their German partners from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha Railway.
In 1917, a museum in the air was destroyed by the artistic toilet.
Turkeyn sources say it was Sabotage.
Since then it has been slowly declined, far from the history.
Today, however, this rail line, at least symbolically, will be the port of anatolyans and all the Eastern to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of the Tükei.
The Governing Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a slightly new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, produced by the borders of the cold war, is lost.
It is now a policy of approach.
It is noted that the Turkish government has a good relationship with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian pillar groups Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course to the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the eck data of this new foreign policy, I have taken the night to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkeyn suat Kiniklioglu.
On the next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a hot drive to Gleisen, who produced the equality of the old world in the known documentation "The Night Mail", I came to see in the Turkey capital as a new city for the new world's projects, the Osman's past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in the Turkeyn unity.
This has resolved some of the missiles in Western, especially in Washington.
A taxi has put me to the main business center of the ACP, a specially prepared, ultramoderated stone and steel construction, in a city developed, rounded by half-finished purchase centres and snakes in which the medium managers are shocked, both men and women, faced to end the first business of the day.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a Middle Law Politicalist of almost any other political party in Europe.
Attachment, Krawatt, I'm sure he's even packed a blackberry.
"The objective of the external policy of the party is now to reintegre Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The cold war was an exception," he told me.
Turkey had been divided from their inner country.
Today she must look at the East and West at the same time.
Don't give any one or the other.
You should do both.
"But surely Turkey could ever be", I asked, "to be able to decide?"
"The Turkey," he said, "I don't want to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point near everybody with whom I spoke here: the relationships of Turkey, not only to the Middle East, but also to the cupcase and around the black sea, are exactly advantages for Europe and the United States, as they are for Turkey.
With the Turkey on the board, it seems to be the message, in the meantime, Europe can walk as a whole to the east direction of Asia and the Middle East.
Back to the Hydarpashas Railway, after another widely sleepless night, I thought about these two German governments Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who had seen this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's environments in the Middle East now, to cut parts, could be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited at the department, which should bring me back to the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man Europes" in those days.
At least, there were no doubts about which continent should have a right to this fascinating country.
Remember Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmoniker and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his wonderful youth chor, Proteus in the next year.
He was thinking for youths up to 21 years, but when the chor last time was sanged by some of us at the end of the last 20 - we refused us to leave the chor.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological channel) was for the disposal and ability of the chores, any music room that was presented to him, even if it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchester.
The musical diversity of such a young chores was often surprising, always shocked and made it only and only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his smiling for the music that never lived over years.
How often our death was to let music speak for himself.
He said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His type of guidance was absolutely clear and precise, but never exceeding.
As the higher was the musical level, he still requested a further height.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If somebody should have shooted to rider, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, where he led the Guildford Philharmoniker.
In the past 40 years, I have written critics for over hundreds of his concerts and I can honestly say that I was never deceived by a single one - often I was inspired by them.
The death of Handley was that rare combination of size and personal discreetness.
He decreased those who, according to his words, were simply "with one or two known sheep offerers in the world."
So many of us will destroy him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
In your call for William Woodruff (25 September) writes that "he re-educed the economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon standard for research in 1950... while he studied a BSc, a MA and a doctor degree at the same time.
This is a conclusion from a author's comment in Woodruff's book "All of Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a docent of the economic history at the university of Nottingham, and during that time he wrote a doctor's work on the British Cook industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, published later in 1958 as "The British Cook Industry".
He was in 1950-1951 in the United States in a Houblon-Normen Stipendium, and conveyed the summer of 1952 to the Universitys of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cut this part of his trains.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological School.
‘I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino ‘Flamenco and Life’, because its photos in black-weight, in the documentary style, are fantastic.
They took me attention to them because of their light and for the strength they extracted, how they always act with respect for the protagonists.
A exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magic moments."
Second round of the excellent sales in Honda.
In November, Honda begins with the marketing of the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his processing model had a large internal space, this large-scale limit increases.
This will also be the technical fences that make it possible to evacuate even more comfortable driving and benzine.
Changes before the previous revolution.
So is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, asthetically, the new Jazz shows a similar line with its operators, the changes that have been made at this large limit are many.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger sizes of the car and the new mechanism are to be stressed.
However, before you start to analyze the new model, you must say that this new Jazz six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda created, in comparison with the other manufacturers, to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon about its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where Jazz is the most sales car of 2002 and also during 2008.
After Jazz appeared on the market, only in Japan was sold about a million models.
The second paragraph market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
However, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segments.
In this way, while japanese enterprises sold a total amount of 83 000 models from Jazz in 2007, the expected estimates of 10000 cars are 17% of the growing increase in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold in total 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, which is 6,7% of the total sale in Honduras in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of the model, the leaders of the branches in Spain expected to sell 2 000 Jazz models per year.
Similarly, it allows the appearance of the new Honda Jazz models to sell in Spain.
In fact, the leaders of the Marke hope to conclude the year with total sale of 22,000 models, which are less than 4,000 cars in 2007, a reduction of 16 %.
In spite of this sale increase, Honda increased its market share in Spain (1,6%) to 1,8 %.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda sets out the appearance of a new model.
This is insight, a Hybridaut with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters long, the Japanese company hopes to sell it about 2000,000 models per year in the world.
In accordance with Japan's market assessments, 50 % of insight models are sold in the United States while the rest of the shares of the old continent and Japan are distributed.
The appearance of the insight on the market is prescribed for the first months of the year, the first time of its public representation will be held in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its sizes.
His length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters ), its width is 1.69 meters (more 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 m, which leads to accepting that it has become the size of 5 centimeters.
The height, however, is not changed and remains 1,52 meters.
With the increase in the dimensions, the internal space is also increased.
This success is to support the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, the central position of the carton container, a solution used in the operational model of Jazz.
The capacity of the copper space, which has a double load surface system, also reached up to 339 litres, so 19 litres greater than the capacity of the copper space of the first generation.
It should be emphasized that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre benzin engine because the capacity of the Honda Jazz copper room with a 1,2 liter benzin engine 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except for the additional equipment elements such as leaflets or the possibility of the panorama windows, will be offered a better access to the sites.
The opening corner of the doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz had only 67 degrees.
The motors of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its market, this small model 2 executions of the benzine engines: 1,2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variables have the i-VTEC system that allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 exits to have excellent technical performance and also provides a round-time performance for the whole engine period.
The first variant with 1,2 liters results in the performance of 90 PS in 6 000 thresholds with a maximum dry moment of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This benzin engine - the operational model of Jazz reached 78 PS - has 5.3 litre gas consumption and CO2 exhibition of 125 grams.
With regard to the operating engine reached at the previous generation 83 PS, he now makes 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litre benzine consumption and 128 gram CO2 exhibition.
‘Autobien’, which prevent collisions
To advance the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan now inspired the nature, more accurately said by the beasts.
The Japanese company has developed a robot who returns to the black behavior of bees and prevents accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineering of the Nissan Motor Co. Technology Centre has developed these small robots in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renamed University of Tokio (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the director of Technology and R&D Brad Management, the BR23C represents an expansion of the four-year security distinction of Nissan.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of these brands are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, every bee builds its own, oval-floor airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan security shield.
But the most important thing is the faceten auges of the beasts that can see over a round of 300 degrees in all directions that allow you to fly in their personal airspace without interruption.
To illustrate the rounddum perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notes obstacles to the BR23C in two meters before the BR23C and in the radio of 180 degrees, the distance to the object and sends a signal to a marginal microprocessor which is directly translated into a signal for avoiding the collision
'In the moment when the obstacle is noted, the small robots will impress the sea flight and immediately change the direction by turning its roots around 90o or even greater rounds to avoid collision.
The greatest difference with other favorite systems consists of the absolute instinct effect of this exhibitor.
If not so, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, ' Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the laboratory for mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bird, the robot can not go up or down, but not over; it can move only on two dimensions and to the direction that allows him to turn his roots and not to the infinite directions and to an infinite way as it makes the beasts.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function next to acceleration and delay functions so that the small robots avoid collisions.
'This device needs only a couple seconds to process the information and act according to these information.
It does not require any information or the intuitive logic of the proposed Manufacturers to save the information, so it can continuously work with only a pair of dual KB of the storage place.
This seems surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage place.
This is the first step in developing technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that the Nissan involves in the following ten years in the series cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are easier and keep longer than the variety of lithium ione batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead to the goal and thus avoid obstacles on the road.
She's on the seat before she's kidnapped with a hypotheke.
It should be seen that the United States Finance Minister, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, but is not shipping.
Before the crisis, and to avoid that the US citizens have been conquered in hypotheken historys of the appropriate payable banks, it was developed a sustainable and informal game for the Internet emergency: 'Bad credit hotel'.
Or maybe the 'hotel of the bad credit' or the interview.
The third aspect of this accommodation and specifically its receptionist is to consider one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask no credit.
And especially where you can do it, what is probably the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but without details.
This is more than one side for the youth than a place for all viewers.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dreaming room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the increase of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) in its company, which would be the first bank in Japan, earned $9 billion, and will take 21% of their capitals, a renewing that is to be a strong case of its burden currency.
One week after a provisional agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG 9,9% of the Morgan Stanley's Stanley stakeholders would be purchased for a uniform price of $25.25, which is a total amount of $3 billion.
The price adopted is less than 19% of the rate of the action from 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the purchase of conversible shares, which will be safely safely for a win of 10% and can be sell back to a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be accompanied on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, i.e. 28 % over the current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's action was against 17.00 GMT by 6.79% to $23.07.
'This strategic link is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank' said John Mack, Director-General of the United States Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which would allow him to extend its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserves.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis imposes the largest name of Wall Street to include a more careful situation than before.
Moreover, the modalities presented on Monday show that the agreement was changed during the last days: last Monday Morgan had clearly declared that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about 8,5 billion dollars to Japan.
'for a week', in Tokio Toshihide Mizuno, the MUFG business leader, we thought that the participation would be completely in stammakers.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and safeguard us. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay for its Morgan Stanley shares 7% under its currency value.
And the business will go from about 20% per share with a decrease of profit.
The agreement suggests that MUFG in one year will be able to convert half of its prior shares in stammakers if the last calling is over 50% over the sales value, i.e. about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the money provided by MUFG will allow him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance and increase their sales.
However, a publisher of the group refused to make more details on the strategic projects of the two new partners.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to obtain a payability rate of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan declared that his balance had been seen since the end of August.
The last weeks were hard for the group who had to see how their burner currency returned around half, while the price for insurance against payment invalidity was fast to the height.
This price returned to Monday, but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other "life" of the large investment banks at Wall Street after the comcours of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, $15 billion, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffet.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic renews socialism of the 21th century.
Thus, the joint project of the Venezolaner Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
That third was that this Sunday, the example of his equivalents and friends, made the plan for a new Constitution.
The mission is fulfilled, as 80% of the public results in the election vote were 64% of the people's vote with 'Ja'.
As a result, 28% agreed with 'No', 7% of the selection store were invalid and 0.7% were dismissed empty.
In order to adopt the Constitution project, a vote must be achieved more than half of all votes issued.

On Sunday's night, Rafael Correa requested otherwise the victory of its constitutional projects.
The Constitution has overwhelmed triumphated in a triumphate way, and he was assured in Guayaquil, the Government's Site of 280 km south-west of Quito and congratulated the Equatorians.
Surely Rafael Correa of Chávez and Morales was welcomed by his chilean equivalent Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which has been held in the style under the Observatory Regulation of the United States (OAS), refers to a text which exists from 444 points to ensure the 'new socialism' for which the President is in place.
The Constitutional Project is transferred to the economy by transposing the only right to the "development planning" in a country which is most commonly from the earth-food promoting by foreign companies and the bonds that are engaged in the country.
The project that is chosen by Correa, 2006, also aims at a more comprehensive state headship that will be able to execute up to two joint mandates from each four year, and will have the opportunity to resolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and work a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education which the President has already started to introduce with 13.9 million people in this country, in which 50% of the population lives under the poverty limit.
Last end, she also intends to prohibit the presence of foreign armies, which will end up the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an equatorial support point as the starting station for American anti-drogen.
The 19 gyms were released in the Cshad
A Egyptian command started the attack on the 11 tourists and their eight accompanies who were arrested ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian students, who were held in the desert for 11 days, were healthy this Monday and unreasonable back to the capital of Egypt.
Tomorrow, they were released from an Egyptian command in the Tshad.
It seems to be a good condition that the helmets reached the military basepoint al-Maza directly next to the international airport of Kairo at 15.30 p.m.
They were sent directly without talking to the press to a helicopter in the hospital of Maadi, a foreign town of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all 'better health' and the departures 'no ransom payment', explained the Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the Rollfield.
On September 19, when she was arrested at a foot of the mountain Oanat in the region of Egypt, the Sudan and Libyan, the group of the Geissels was always returned to 35 unknown residents from a hidden next.
It is about 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - and more than eight Egyptian leaders: two leaders, four chauffors, one border hire and the Director of Agirus, Safari.

letters - The silent majority of the culture
A debate on the financing of the culture makes slaughter lines and is central topics of the current election campaign.
It's better.
But a area of our cultural life remains still forgotten.
Who will stand up and approve the natural sums that are granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological expansions or the national historical places that are quietly hungry?
What political politicians will it be to remind the federal government that they degrad their thinkers and their culturally important buildings?
What does it exist in Quebec, as well as in Canada, have no right laws that effectively protect our culturals?
Do you know that the French government only provides 3,5 million euros for the restoration of the Close of China in Loiretal?
Our American neighbors are written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the culture of the American culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government areas, in mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the association of the creatures Quebecs, at least 40,000 honor officials who are assembled in 211 creatures, thus to be intensely addressed with the history, to save the numerous privacy archives and to obtain the archaeological rests.
They are also often the guards of our culturers that protest with the power of destruction when the promotors and decision-makers leave their burdozers on our old stones and forgotten peace heights.
When will it be a strike for history and culturalher?
Benelux governments State parts of the Fortis Bank
In part, the Benelux States want to enter the Belgian and Dutch Fortis Bank in Turkey: the three States are available to the Bank and Insurance Institute, which is also available in Hungary, total EUR 11,2 billion.
The Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted the European Competitive Authority at the highest level at the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the advisor of the European Commission's Competitive Authority.
In the euro area, the Fortis is the first victims of the international financial market crisis that have been held for a year, so that decisions that are now taken in relation to the bank could have been presented.
In the meaning of the decision taken on Sunday, all three States purchase the respective share of the bank to about 49%.
The bank will probably sell a part of its shares, all of the insurance activities bought by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis' shares have started a steel shop in the second half of the weeks, serious crisis scenarios were already understood.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is too large for a pledge.
The value papers of the Institute have been 12% on Friday at a 14-year-old rate.
Since boys, the value of the shares has been over two thirds.
In view of the current share rates, the market value of the group is EUR 14 billion, but is unrealistic.
In view of the management, the USD is 700 billion tear American salvation package, and the insecurity of the markets debt to the power of the Fortis acts.
However, on Monday, the courses are easily increased.
On Friday, Philip Derrckx was appointed to the new director of the Bank.
The currency institute was also on the search for a private buyer, but it was not interested in a special offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to shoot - no investor is going to sit his money, said it.
Among the customers, no panic is broken, the branches of the bank have not been formed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has own filials, but it also calls her own Leasing companies.
Fuchs in Hahnerstall
Because of the medical consumption of a person in the United States, a contract with a customer often refuses to complete life and health insurances.
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market could be uncontrolled.
" There are data protection programmes that link the use of medicine data in any case to the approval of the concerned.
These should be in an independent hand, at least we trust in the flights" - quotes Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for follow-up of recording data.
Insurances shall be determined as a result of the health situation of the customer, and the risk should be estimated too high, the insurance will not yet be completed.
Previously, the customer was sent to a medical investigation, and the contract was only informed of the results of the investigation.
10 years ago Dick found a widely favorable method: based on the identification number of the customer, he refers to the data of the last half years of the pharmaceuticals, speaking to which preparatory was purchased, and the program calculates the disease of the customer and the health condition.
For example, if it regularly purchases large quantities of cholesterin-sensitive medicine, it would result that his blood-food level is not treatable, which would be automatically cleaned in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in the course - some even define a risk multiplicator, so the insurances must only be achieved by the paper chronics, however, there are smaller difficulties.
One of the depths is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as migrations and heat warnings, but also against depressions.
The latter is a high risk factor, while not mentioned above.
For the application and processing of the data, own companies have formed themselves, which, before they relate to the data, request the patients for their approval.
In the meantime, they must do this by law, although submissions have not been abolished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory research and connect them to the data on the medical consumption, which provides a more accurate image on the health status of patients.
More companies have access to data, and the control of their use will become more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a own data protection law for healthy data, its effects are only on health services and insurances.
The draft legislation was already presented to the Congress, and the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard considers that this is too little, so he wants to develop its program, so that the data can only be forwarded with the understanding of the interested person.
Another question is, of course, that the interested person may probably not submit access to its data, as the insurances do not conclude any contract with him.
And so the hairs are only left for some of the grace of the fire.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double the trade
After the European Union and India are both leading trade partners of each other, this was the main theme in addition to other global problems at the nineth meeting.
Today, the French and Indian summit is also in place, which is mainly discussed on the cooperation in the Atomic Energy Sector.
However, the European Union recognizes that India is an encouraging, democratic power that should be given in international concerns more voting and interdependence laws, but the Member States could not even be able to support the permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council, or not.
This question was not discussed last night at the strict nine meetings in Marseille.
The French President and the current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, and President José Manuel Barroso and Headdiplomat Javier Solana, President of the Indian Minister Manmohan Singh, were welcomed by the President of the European Union, Mr. Manmohan Singh, which doubles the trade in the coming five years, which is to be increased by 100 billion euros.
In view of the fact that the trade of goods was increased between 2000 and 2007 from 25 to 55 billion, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 civil aircraft agreements with India have also been legally set together to an agreement so that the air traffic will be in the future.
By 2009, India wants to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the package.
The objective is to create an unreasonable relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is an Indian partner, the New Delhi is only nine among EU partners.
The meeting was devoted to the global concerns.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in relation to the terrorism, both on the strongest sides, was also urged to introduce an UNO conference.
The Doha round should also be closed, with both sides of the slaughter.
The EU stressed that it was to establish its energy and climate programme, which means that the emissions of polluted fuel should be reduced at least 20% until 2020.
In this way, India agreed that the proposal was to close a global compromise at the future climate and to reduce the gas production up to 2050 to 50%.
The price increase in food should also be combated, so both supports the integration of a international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of Government is visiting the French capital, where it will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of the nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is expected to be contracted by French companies in value of EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency's notifications, the Agreement should be decided for 15 years.

The details have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mamoth Lakes between California and Nevada.
However, in the aircraft there was no human rest.
The Sheriff of Madera Conunty, John Anderson, completed the last doubts during a press conference: "The aircraft has been localized where a troop was spent. Now we have the security that it is about the airport with Steve Fossett on the day of his loss."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human rest was found in the flight or near it.
The 63-year-old milliarder was declared to be declared in February.
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb)gab noted that some hours after the aircraft's visibility, a machine identified the machine: this is the Bellanca 8kcab lost on September 3, 2007 after Fossett in Yerington in Nevada was started to a 3-st flight.
Last night, some of the personal objects of Fossett from a couple close to their home in the Mamoth Lakes were found in California.
This is two statements with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, Bargeld and a Jacke.
The search for Fossett was established a month after its loss.
The Milliardary had been a place in the history by a long follow-up of records.
In 2002, in the first time, he began to turn the world ball into a home bed ball: a two-week, one-week flight.
Three years later, he turned the world into a single flight without interim aircraft with a flight.
Under his own record, 15445 m is also a height flight over the Anden, but this is a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv that takes place through its original design and the special line management, the downloading surface and its clear angles from the original scheme.
Mercedes-Benz tried to visit the new breast sector.
As a result of its extraordinary properties, the idea of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen since October 17, in the showroom of Mercedes.
Thus, the public trolley that will be accompanied by the appearance of the new model, also in a new clothing, or in a 3D campaign – this will be a news in the auto-sector in Italy.
A project with a maximum shift that is taken in different phases, which will take the central shopping million of Millands, is to be implemented by Corso Como until 15 November.
The first stage will be made from the presentation of the car, where 3D bridges that are distributed near the Corso Como are to give all a special option: the new suite will appear in its nearly real sizes as a three-dimensional model.
Indeed, the car is so likely from the placet on which it is formed is appeared.
This will be viewed with the help of Elumina8 technology of the new glue in different moments in all its details to restore it as a whole.
Nevertheless, it is to introduce the concern of Mercedes with this advertising a new type of authorclame in this most stereotype field.
But will it be possible to travel to the interest of future buyers?
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are
You come from the Triveneto – now they risk the stadium ban
Who are only those 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all Italy is shocking now? They are part of the grouping "Other Italia" which travels back from the Italian nationality for years and, sincerely, have caused no serious problems until recently.
There's never come to counteract with opposite fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The promotors are out of the Triveneto.
From Verona, Patva, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia there were other smaller groups from Camannia and Apulia.
They're taking the tricolori that appears to the cities of the militarys: however, they were distant on Saturday to avoid identity.
Your examples are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there is now a truly legal radiical fans, that of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans 144 cards were available for the game: all were sent on name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also controlled by the Viminal: no one was under the sophistication of a run-up stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian manity, which were already predicted in this regard, were also rejected the ticket and travel to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to guide further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi may receive a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban which prevents access to stages throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will not put one feet in a stadium.
Happy.
But now there is, of course, fear of descendants who could follow these fewer than 150.
"This burning must be emerged immediately, and that does not give such behavior the possibility of justifying", says the Viminal.
Thus, "before focusing on the game of the nationality at midnight in Lecce."
In fact, in Apulia is a small nuclear of the Italian Ultra.
The Hospital (Sport Surveillance), on Tuesday, the Casms, which can be accompanied by a part of the Asian Asia, such as the secret services that are employed with the problem of the stadium manager.
"Duce-Duce calls and the right-to-left arm during the hymne of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a criminal..."
This is the gratitude of Domenico Mazzilli, which is the director of the Observatory since few weeks (he overcome the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously Mazzilli was the president of Trieste, where Ultras Italia was founded in 2002.
Indeed, Mazzilli says that it is not against the law to glorify the duce, but, of course, the conduct of these 150-200 people was a damage.
"I'm not sociolog – adds No. 1 of the Observatory Authority – the crimes are raised in the country of their acts.
Before this group had been maintained in the area, but now it must be overlooked what happened and happens.
But we also talk about the ships during the Hymne Mamelis: even though this is not a criminal, they let me, where there is no education."
