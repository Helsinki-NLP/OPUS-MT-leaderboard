At the last parliamentary elections in 2017, Adg first tried to Bundestag, receiving 94 deputatians (of 709).

The formulation was registered by a biological subgroup which was not involved in the congregation, but was the simplest and legally designed.
Most members of the congregation were members of the Headquarters of the Swedish Russian "Illie Svirida (6 subgroup) and the CDPF (4 subgroups).
Three independent subgroups were joined from the lower New York, Volunteer and Orembourg.

How does the Turbine Court appreciation in the Lockomotive Machine?
- I think that this arbitre confirmed its inadmissibility to the judge of the Russian Prime Minister.
I'm surprising that the opposites in the fiveth Sparttak tour, "Dinamo", or Turbin's leaders, have not made serious conclusions on his low qualification.
The result was not slowly said in the nineth tour: the errors in his actions, the private slaughter slowed as the corner of the swimming.
For example, in the 50th minute, Edher's heavy carpet spends with hands in his trap area of Roddho's protector.
From the door, eight meters, but the Turbine does not become the tools.
- How does the episode appreciation with the Jewish participation, who was at the 82th minute when showing that the meat went into his hand?
- I think there was a sweet protector's hand game in his shooting area.
Turbine was close to the moment, well seeing the episode and his first assistant right.
The reserve court of Sergei Karasev should be viewed at that time.
However, the three were sleeping, and the panels were not assigned.
Thus, the match account was scattered, and the sports justice was disappointed.
It was the same case when the judge was excited and entered the sportive spirit of the game.
- At the 52th minute, Turbin was not decided to remove the protective Olega Ivanwa, who violated the Rules of Combating the Croatia, and when the judge showed the desire of the card, he was demonstrated.
What do you think about this episode?
Should you show the second shooter?
- Turbin and the first desire of the card weren't in the case.
The second would be unlogical.
- Olega Ivano said after the shock of the two standards of the courtyard that some teams are shocking for violations such as the episode of Judah and no one.
What are the words of the footballist?
- The show is to understand two standards.
It was the tools.
He didn't.
The arbitre does not give the second tool to the opposite doors.
This is the principle used.
And the second moment of double standards that the judges see who plays.
This played in the Sunday Loomotive and Ahmat has serious claims for Turkey's work, because the team was degraded.

So long and long - how is it right?
There's no word before.
Right, long.
The word "then" in terms of "truck, impact, effect" is only fonthetic because we hear the sound instead of "a" instead of "during".
We're using this word, thinking that it's happening from the word "retribution".
But "relief" and "during" are not only close, but even in some sense, contradictory.
Make sure of this.
Longer means "better, full, enough to be enough for anybody or something."
Congratulations, joy are family words.
It was still meaningful "not depending on anything to have a self-determined meaning" - "that you have."
Anciently, the old-authorized "learn" by "related" and "voy".
To give it to me, it's completely other.
In these words, the actually threatening "nationists": daos is "wolf" (the sheep), deyja, "more" and dvaidī, "protect".
The word "related" and "during" and the unlimited slaughter of the last, made it possible to enter them into the contamination.
So we've come to the same "d" which is used in writing through "a", which is goodly wrong and impossible in the context of the process of emergency and development of these words.
So, it's right.
But this is the word that is slow, which is no longer used in its right meaning.
If you want to note that any circumstances/persons have a negative impact on you above, use the word "to give".
You can also use the construction "to show pressure", but remember that it is cancer.
