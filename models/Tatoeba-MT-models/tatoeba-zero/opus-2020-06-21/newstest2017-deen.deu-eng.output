28-year-old coch in San Francisco Mall to open up
A 28-year-old coch, who had recently been cast to San Francisco, was discovered in the tremendous house of a local purchase centre.
The victim's brother said he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "It's finally going to go back with him."
The body name found at Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Gallicia from San Francisco, and shared the direct medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was killed as a murder and the investigations are in the course.

A speaker of the Son & Droit said she was "shocked and destroyed on the ground".
"We are a small team that works like a close family, and we're gonna hurt him", said the speaker.
Our thinking and our suffering are in this serious time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia admitted that Frank first lived in hostels, but "the things finally went to the mountain for him."
"He found a apartment, he had a girlfriend," she shared with Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his young brother.
He was a friendly man with a great heart.
His kind to bind with his family was to always cook us to prepare our dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of interference.
He was the brother who broke with the electric.
"For all the things in the world, he was this unclean diamond that lighted every day," he said.
Every person who has information on the case is requested to call the SFPD's phone phone under number 415 575-4444.
Jennifer Anistones: I will always be shooted in shoots
Jennifer Anistones must not always be perfect or successful.
This has clearly made the Hollywood Star in an interview.
"I will always be shooted in shoes or beat from outside labels that are mostly little to do with me and the reality."
"I have no desire to always be perfect and successful."
"Really say, these things are worse to me."
Jennifer Anistones (47) can only smile that it applies as "Miss Perfect" as it says in the current "cosmopolitan".
The most likely the shoes cut their time home, forming television with low sweet and mexican food, which is in the magasin.

The movie runs with us from August 25.
Golfer Langer receives the sport pyramid
His experiences on the horse are overviewable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little disappearing with an exit on the beach.
For the 58-year-old boys it was a premier.
CHIO: "Goldene Sport Pyramide" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses recalled to their feast, and they gathered in the fast gallopp home to the food trails.
One kilometer from this time, I've been afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," Langer says.
And that's why the reitcarriare ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfers were all times - 101 Tourism - again near horses.
He went to his family about the ALRV installation, he was not weak at a horse.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and also at the CHIO.
The reason was convinced.
The German sports aid delivered the man from home in a small gala the golden sport pyramid.
Unless the sympathic sportr is missing at signs.
Federal Service Cross, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has joined him.
The 18th prices of the sport pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first priceholder Hans Days Winkler on Saturday.
"This marking is very important to me," says Langer, "if it will be forgiven not only for sportive success but also for social commitment."
For decades, Longer has promoted the education.
And so he also gave the price payment of EUR 25,000.
On Saturday after Saturday, the US Master's two-fold sporter was included in the "Hall of Fame of German Sports".
The magnificents include the slightest Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fighter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Myhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the priest Alwin Schokem√∂hle and the posthum of the handballer Erhard wonderfully.
Many of these sports members came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society moved to the spring stadium where the Lavazza price left.
Bernhard Langer was a distance to the great animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that wants both Clinton and Trump.
However, one of the two US Chairpersons is the fiscal and energy policy and a principle question.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, more philosophical difference.
That's about the role of the State.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt smaller and warn the way the economic state can harm - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death, he says.
However, he would be a very different thing, said Trump.
He will raise regulations massively, and makes himself for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates, for privates and for businesses.
Clinton, however, says: The State has to carry out certain tasks, he has an opportunity to open and needs money.
The taxes for the rich would therefore be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the theme infrastructure.
In which you have to invest, Trump and Clinton are almost anywhere.
The Democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
Government investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-crisis theaparty flights of the Republicans.
Thus, on the Trump, there could be even part-party discussions.
People are the differences in the energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal powers and re-enhance carbon promotion in the United States.
Oil promotion is also to be possible in protected areas that it wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement.
Clinton, however, wants to cultivate the renewable energy with its investment programme and calls for: "A country will be the superpower of cleaner energy and create millions of jobs."
"It's likely to be China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
However, not only in the infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far away from each other.
TPP, the transpazify trade agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, both USA will not isolate the international trade - but just protect American jobs better.
They should also be paid better, like Clinton.
The current minimum loan of 7.25 US Dollar is a huge loan.
He wants to increase $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: The minimum loan must be slow, then he says that it should not be changed.
However, the great debate of the next months should be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two loans.
On the one side, the trumpet is which wants to decide the economy and the citizens to cultivate growth.
His critics are to keep him in order to increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who, at least the riches, wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.
Fire: "Ever flighted woman has experiences with sexual violence."
Sexual violence belongs to women who run alone almost every day.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumated.
A house offers refugee.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that is up to one year.
One put her little son in the arm.
He's shocking in the room with great eyes.
His mother is on the table plate.
Before she notes she's watched.
She's laughing short and kissing the little ones.
The scene is normal.
Before you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the sector business leader of Condrobs, a firm for social aid offers in Bayern, and is employed with the subject of women on the flight.
The four women in the kitchen are fled.
They live in the Middle North in one of the few decental accommodations for single-free women and their children in Bayern.
In January Condrobs, the establishment was held together with the Pro Familia and the Muncher Women's Aid.
She was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a watchman before the door.
"It's not over to say: Every woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence on her fleet," says Bahr.
"Mans run because of wars, because they are politically persecuted because they are threatened by torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopestors," she says.
Other reasons for fleet are overwhelmed by women: "My people are shooting from home because they do not see any other way."
In their homes, they have experienced sexual violence, pregnancy, honor, slavery or pregnancy prostitution.
That's what she's going on.
It's on the flight.
"The slapper, for example, calls for sexual action for a flash water, is not rare," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they will not be protected by their families.
Who believes that it ended when they come to Germany, it's irreversible, Barr.
The only women in refugee accommodations would also often be considered less valued and, in the worst case, missed.
This results that about 90 per cent of the women who live in the northern municipality are traumated, she estimates.
" Some of the children have not certainly been voluntary."
Many women are so habituated that they say nothing.
"or they don't believe to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too large."
As she often don't know how to help, there is only more accommodations for her, it requires Bahr.
In Bayern, the seven district governments are responsible for the submission of refugees.
The question of whether they are aware of a similar project as in Munich in their responsibilities, some respond to No.
There is no way in government accommodations in the superpopulation and overflying diseases.
Even in sweet women are not understood separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the Government's preaching speaker.
In superbayers, under- and medium-sized hospitals, there are Stockworks or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is the Netherlands, there are two central accommodations only for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women separated from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it is very important that men and women be hidden separately.
"If the privacy has been joined or men and women together, it may be too - prosecuting - violence against women."
In particular, the wash spaces should be separated and available for women is available in the study.
How much the women blew this protection needs, they can be given on the Andrang that it is on the house in Munich.
"When we talked about it, we have a long wartelist," says Bahr.
You can easily shut up a second house.
Assistant physicians: Requirements to new working campaigns
The representatives of the Assistant Aids have called on their work to approve new working combats in their strictness with regard to a new treaty.
The Juneor Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) requested its entire Council to authorize more work-up measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that the Minister would have been decreased to address the concerns relating to the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students agreed in July on the rejection of a treaty agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected from 58 % of his members who voted at the elections.
In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday, the President of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained quiet to problems, which resulted in the rejection of the treaty.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC has agreed to completely suspend the proposed new treaty and invite official negotiations on all your concerns."
As a response to the Government's slaughter, the JDC Administration has today made a formal request to a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to authorize a schedule of scaled working combats that begins in September.
The strictness resulted in the six times this year, the first total accidents in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Assistance doctor Dr. Johann Malawana returned to the election to reject the treaty conditions recommended by the BMA.
He shared BMA members during the meetings still held by 54.000 physicians and physicians before vote, which should be benefited and adopted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors would be introduced in England.
Russia and Turkey: "A Aliance of Foreign Seaers"?
It was a spirit that ended a crisis.
The Russian leaders and Turkey were meeting on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months of the long-term war of the words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposers in the rewarded hall of St. Petersburger Palasts, I can't imagine that Ankara wants mostly to condemn this condemnation.
There was the shooting, yeah.
But Putin's laughter was smelling, and he distracted little heat, even for his remaining situation.
Recep Tayip Erdogan, however, repeated his " loved friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't tell it anymore.
He also promised that the relationships with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but also be improved.
On the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have called himself as if it would never happen anymore.
I look like his exhusiasmus shows the opposite.
But one of Putin's extraordinary, sustainable kitchens showed that the head of Russia had nothing forgotten.
Moreover, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the cutting of a Russian fighting fleet on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Mocaus reaction at the time was burned.
Putin divide and accused Ankara to be cast into Russia.
The conduct was even greater, since it began from a generous friend.
Reconstruction of the veterinary will be difficult if not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has turned into place since November.
For months, stately controlled media have caused a strong, unlimited attack on Ankara.
On one occasion, it seemed that the towers would take the blame for all.
Most seriously, the accused of leaders were that Erdogan‚Äôs own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syrian regions that were controlled by the Islamic State.
He's struggling this.
But in St. Petesburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received the apologize that he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia could win a sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a weapon stand are clearly on the hand.
However, first-line, all the friends he can get after his last month in a deceived state status almost take place.
Repeat terrorist attacks on Turkey have also threatened him.
But there are also economic motivations.
Russian sanctions have affected Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually brings several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has been almost 90% declined.
In Russia, travel organizations and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are recovered again.
They are counting on a late seasonal adjustment to the Mediterranean.
This week prognosed the public vision of more than bill fruit and vegetables when the Turkish agricultural imports were re-enabled.
A report in Vedemosti formulated as follows: "Tourists there long, tomates here long."
But the visit had a further political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the western, since it considers its reaction to the tried power overlooking as a weak answer.
The continuing crowd of the EU-accession negotiations and Putin, which is intended to take advantage of the cold stimulation and reduce the relationship with Turkey to the west.
The Russian Head of State wins in Ankara with security a bonus for requesting support to the chosen state bodies.
This is a self-conscience for Moscow, which has a deep fear of regime changes.
The meeting in this brilliant palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, a analytics, to represent "Aliance of Foreign Seaers": two countries who disappeared from the western and treated badly and now condemned.
However, despite the public condemnation, there are still large differences between the two.
The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently provided the role as a Peace-inspector, but where Russia and Turkey supported contractual sides.
It could be noted that, nearly three hours after the first meeting, both Presidents had not been addressed at the press conference that they hadn't ever been addressed to the subject.
The President of Turkey avoided responding to a question on its differences while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common namer in Syria can be found.
But after months of open enemy - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster than the NATO-Turkei member of Turkey has taken the Russian fight - it is certainly better that the two heads of State speak at least with each other.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Skotlands no longer available
The Marke RBS is intended to be reduced by the head of the bank only to a backoffice role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Skotlands.
Ross McEwan shared the BBC Scotland that the Marke RBS was linked to the global areas of the bank.
The bank has been distanced since it was almost collected and saved for eight years.
In this time, marking "RBS" has been used to protect other final consumer finance marks.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsorring, from six United Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Sieger Andy Murray.
But now she decided to turn more national brands into the focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentral headquarters and the B√∂rsennotification to NatWest will be changed.
Marke Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private business that will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan has been interviewed during a board of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He shared the BBC Scotland with: "The brand RSB will be to our investor brands and to the brand where our employees will be employed, as we now become more to a bank of brands."
As the bank has become a global brand, RBS became the global brand.
I now say that we are not global targets, but the local goals.
Each of these brands will be in their own communities for something perfectly different, and our employees will work with the customers.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its Six United Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the reliability of the various brands in its sports sponsoring.
"It is time for us to develop the bank of the brands, because how do we focus on the internal (which asked) to make this to a better bank for customers?" said the Chief.
It would have been very cynic three years ago if we would have said that we would be a great bank for our customers and had launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time is coming.
Frankie Dettor reached his 3.000 winners at Newmarket
Dettori speaks from a double at New Market that brings him 3,000 wins
The Jockey Frankie Dettor saved his 3.000 British winners at Newmarket on Friday.
He put on Predilection trained by John Gosden on his local renards with his second winning night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey that reaches the milk stone in the flash.
He followed Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-year-old victor, who won on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I'm very happy that it happened to Newmarket because I've been here for 30 years.
It's not a great meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal freeday end with 20,000 people.
I'm easy and very discreet.
Dettori takes the jubel when he gets the victory on prediction
Two jockey has reached the milestones in the shore - Jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-year-old winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached over 4,300 seats in a recruiting career.
Lester Piggott, who had a nine-year-by-by-drop 4.493 carriage
Frankie is one of the best jockey of moderns and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that has just reached little before him.
He has style and is strong, but it's his tactical intellectual that differs him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic messanger for rents, his exhusiasmus and Charisma has been shocking fans for many years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had been able to win 6,000 if he wasn't only a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already been in GB almost 30 years of winner, which is good.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British course, but also he is an incredible jokey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the millstone with a typical flying dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the escape of the British Flachrens for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of great tournament winners, including his famous "Glororeichen Seven" in Ascot 1996, but he also survived a aircraft abuse and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month sperre, but he showed a impressive characteristic strength to comfort his dubbles and return to his best form.
And he has not yet been at the end - the Dettor has previously said that he wants to continue with competitions to at least 50th year of life.
Russians Putin Fire Stab Head Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin, unexpectedly, left his chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of the most closest confidence circle of Putin.
The 63-year-old was appointed to the Special Officer for Environment and Transport Affairs.
In an opinion of the Kreml, Putin has not indicated reasons "the release of Ivanovs from his obligations as President of the Russian Presidency Administration".
Anton Vaino, who was the Vice-President since 2012 of Ivanov, was appointed to his followers.
Once, 44, it's former diplomat.
1972, in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he completed his conclusion at the renomeed state Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the message in Tokyo.
On the website of the Kreml, it is (the Russian) that he was later Head of the Government staff.
For his name he said to Putin: "Thank for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the Government to support your activities as the Head of State in respect of legislation designs and controls for the implementation of your instructions.
Putin shared the Russian TV sender on Friday that Ivanov requested to leave his posts and recommended Moroo as his follower.
Do you convince the crazy faces?
This step has made a secret place in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the most closely trusted Vladimir Putins and works like he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men of the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was distracted at the television, both men said that the head of the steel would return to his own desire.
But despite the laugh for the cameras, only few of them are convinced here - especially now, short before the Parliament's choice.
So here is the consequence of a kind of power fight?
Nobody knows that now.
But the official observation - that a man who was first as a potential president wants to lead to the Russian environmental policy - is a great skepsi.
In his comments on Putin, quoted on the website of the Kreml, Ivanov said "It's true that I requested you in a conversation in the beginning of 2012, to trust me these very complex posts - nearly - for four years.
I am the President of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov adopted the posts in December 2011.
Previously, he was the Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin's wives member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, as Putin President of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his senior.
As putin to the power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he mostly trusted.
First, it was accepted that Ivanov could be President of Russia after Putin's second official period, since a third official period of Putin would have disfellowshipped against the Constitution.
But these posts were taken by another closely associated Putins, Dmitry Medvedv.
Putin became President before he became President for three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson was fired after he tried producers
Gibson was involved in a physical interview at the seat of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its advertising in a common opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, regreted himself on Thursday before the announcement of his proclamation.
In the Set, it came to artistic differences and a difference of opinion.
I blend the event," he said in a communication.
Details about how the Character Gibson is described from the series following a FBI agents team will be published in the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios for a later time.
The 54-year-old-children, playing in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been with it since the first stage of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I had the last twelve years my whole heart blow in the sight," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I hoped to be there until the end, but it will not be possible now.
I would simply like to thank the authors, producers, players, our wonderful crowd and especially the best fans you can want for a series.
The planned extraction of the twelve stake is set on 28 September.
Racing for fish in the gardens in Banff
A population of Banff requested the identification of fishing aid in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that it could be the 75 fish on the sandale that were cut off by a spring brown.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could cut some light on the appearance of the two dull fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to fife
The ¬£ 1,35 billion tee project will be completed until May 2017
Ingenieurs have connected the north-deck of the Queensferry Crossings with the Viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected to fife.
It's the first of four closures of the "deck floor", which draws close to each of the three doors of the bridge.
The pound part of Fife is now 600 meters long and grows 30,000 tonnes.
It has more than 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of beton and 46 pounds.
The ¬£ 1,35 billion tee project will be completed until May 2017.
Keith Brown, Minister of Economy, was a visit to the building today and was one of the first ones from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all Witnesses of an engineering art of a really psychiatical measure in this project with over 30,000 ton Beton and Steel, which were used only for this part of the bridges.
In spite of the massive size and weight of the bridge, the end of the closure between the line and the bridge end is a heavy activity that requires extreme tolerances for the path.
Overall, almost 79% of the whole bridge ends on their place and the last section of the shop today in Rosyth takes a part for the box, which means that the whole board is ready to get up on the bridges on its place.
Michael Martin, Project Chief of Forth Crossing Bridge Construtors said: "The first conclusion is a significant milk stone at each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the conclusion of high- and depth construction is a substantial basis.
After the installation of the last road department and its connection with the Northern Turmhead in the construction, we had to close the still existing clouds on the north or country side.
This has been reached by the seas of the northern bridges at the south of 700 billion.
This was a massive and simultaneous activity.
Massive, since the Viadut is 222 meters long, about 6.000 tonnes and must be taken up to the top by about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances on which the team worked, were changing - on each side they strike only a few millimeters.
Happyly, it's very good.
Reservation in the Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Third still being alive"
Three men have been "speaking still in life" after they were captured from their fishermen boat before England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station took place on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties to shine in safe while their ship moved out of their own power.
"We saw how the ship turned around and put us the worst thing," said the Chief of Moelfre Vince Jones' Saviation Station.
"Nevertheless, the strong winds have shocked the ship out of their ship, until we leave to water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fisherman boat while the third man was shocked in the age of 60 and found on a bodge without saving weight.
They were all at the board of the coastal boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr Jones said, "The three men who were cast into the water have been unfortunate and still lived.
The boat engine had an emergency apple, but it was resolved at the ships of the man who controlled the ship.
Somebody's waiting about these men today.
Sweet - Man stands on his ex-fellow friend
A man has attacked his former friend in Hamburg-Harbourg with a mel and hard hurt.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old boys had received the key to the apartment to take his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized murders decreased the clothing of his former friend.
When he came to the apartment, he went into her twice.
The 44-children were injured in the hand and in the body.
The police could arrest the murder.
While the 50-year-old boys destroyed the clothing of his former friend, he called his mother.
This warned her sister.
With the risks of their life, the 45-year-old boys wanted to calm their brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her lives dangers.
On the street, they met the ex-life danger of the man.
When the two women retraced the apartment again, the 50-year-old sister took his sister on the side and took his former friend.
Who builds guest apartments?
I believe the SPD and Green: the investors must be taken in the future much more.
How do we react to the bad news that birth in the next years will lose nearly 1300 accommodations?
The SPD proposes a "concept of relief" at the next Council meeting.
But the strict is scheduled.
First of all, the question is: Who will actually build the favorite apartments?
There is no arrangement.
SPD Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We are joined with the green: Who wants to build on urban areas must present 20% of all apartments as social housing."
However, the favorite apartments can also occur.
However, the great point in the Council House is, Bratmann says, "What is going to be transformed with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent in such areas, but at least 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."
A new accommodation programme, which will be cost-and-financed and still financed, is to ensure encouragement.
The problem, so Bratmann: "There is still no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants to make the investors a few rules as possible.
The left wants to be slowly stored for investors.
Unlike this, Bratmann, the situation is being strengthened in the accommodation market.
When implementing the approach to action, it shall be ensured for additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's unexpected if we're gonna get the experts.
However, the program is not available: for around 1260 new apartments should be built without any other.
But how does the loss of around 1300 favourable apartments dealing with the promotion of the next years?
Only until 2020 will be 500 apartments.
To prevent this, the planning policy speaker Nicole Palm should now be bought out of the city.
Moreover, it should be considered to get apartments back to the price connection.
It's possible in Western city.
On a shock, the problem resolved.
Because in the Western city it's going to be the end of the year.
Return 1800 apartments could be taken back to the price connection for pleasant apartments.
Only: This does not want the owners, the housing companies.
Because the number of social housing in the Western city will be drastly increased, and it will be removed from the objective of such a processing.
A concentration of social weakness in only few cities should not be given.
The green claims that there is still movement in the debate.
The Chairman of the Group Herlitschke says, "For a wide majority, the CDD must be in the boat."
It has focused on more buildings for individual households.
But what does not mean that it is not yet possible to find a compromise.
Pokemon Go, a Jagd for Health and Happiness, who rejoice
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
That teenage and kids do not go outside, but is more likely to spend their free time to shoot on screens in the last decade of years.
In Pokemon Go, it's about to take people from the sofa and become more active.
The time on the screen was initially on the television, then on video games, and lastly on smartphones.
It is therefore nice to see that technology and activities are not excluded in the free.
I think of it, of course, on the Pokemon Go-Wahn, a app based on the characters that first was created for video games in the 1990s (which later occurred a character trick series, game cards and other Spin opens).
As many people's phenomenons have found the interest in publishing the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand starting July.
The marketing in other countries was moved by the mass demand that the server was overlooked.
In the meantime, Pok√©mon Go had more users than tender and almost so much as Twitter.
How does it work?
Shortly said the players are going out with their smartphones and search for pokemons that are followed with a GPS and when they are found once, "fotographed" (for a screenshot on the phone) or "arried" can be taken.
A generation that played the game when she was younger, closed the shooting and spent for the search of the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that returned the "medial" person every day.
Cardiogram, a app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently shared the Washington Post that within two days after marketing the game, the number of those who are following training each day from 45% to 53%.
The company does not know who's playing Pokemon Go - it only sees the Roh data to increase performance.
Many public advertising campaigns for health that people want to "to take the time for 30 minutes", "to come to sofa" and "move every day to be active" are cut on babies, because many public news are careful for health and come from people who are quiet.
However, the importance of sport cannot be exceededed.
Anyone who regularly takes sports reduces his opportunities to cure cancer or depression.
Physical confirmation helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to make them here.
But the wonderful Pokemon Go is that it brings people to do something free to make them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health will be discovered - movement, fresh air and sun appearance, and fun.
Some people close even new friendships on the Jagd.
As always, there are more moral players who have to be disappointed about something.
And so, someone could walk against a door.
What is it?
It's a break.
Even if Smartphone apps were able to follow our activities previously, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game.
The new will lose his journey, and the use will be left with time.
However, on the basis of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will join apps and virtual reality with active competitors in the real world and that helps many people to be more active, fair and sinner.

Simone Biles creates gold in the bathroom
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hip.
Simone Biles is on all the immune.
Dynamically on the floor.
Unfortunately on the balcony.
Food on the ground.
On all lines brilliant.
And now, finally, too.
The 19-year-old American tournament took place on Thursday to a multi-fighting title and increased the lake between himself and the rest of the world before all the eyes under the light of the Olympic Games.
The total result of 62.198 was clearly before the Silver Medailler winners and "Final Five" Mannation camera Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronze Medailler winner Aliya Mustafin.
The American American Simone Biles turns to the swimming bar during the individual sea campfinal of women at the art tour at the Olympic summer games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth theerosexuelle American who wins a plural combat title and totally sets its call to be the best of her generation, or even even.
She showed her final result and ended her long travel in this moment.
This success puts it in the same liga as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated their sport type in the past three years, 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing practices that have involved a mixing of honor and precision that the Olympicist of Mary Lou Retton of 1984 said that she is "the best tourner that I ever saw".
She expected a last test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but much more between her and a late overdimensional expectations.
Not with a handful gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be seen as a deceit.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman, after they win all the gold and silver in the individual meal campfinal of women at the Olympic summer games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, 2016
Biles took the first medaille on Tuesday, while she served on the appointment feast, Martha Karolyi, as an appeal mark.
Although Biles had been there, while their long way towards the pitches, never planning the future, it's not really true.
A part of their earthquakes, including their typical tumbling pass, is agreed on Latin America's music, which would be at home on the street outside the Olympiarena in Rio.
That's not a accident.
This girl who was adopted as a little child by her grandma and found by Trainerin Aimee Boorman's mother during a school flight in the tournhal, in Boorman, was trained to be forced.
She has no longer lost competitive competition since summer 2013, a victory that will stop as long as Bales wants.
Even though Mustafin was easier to lead through two drags, the image tried.
Swimming bars and ground tours - in which Biles holds the world's majority.
She reared with 15.433 on the swimming bar, and put it again with a 15.933 on the ground.
Raisman surrounded her when she waited for her finger - a pure formality - and stroke on Bales bright, white and blue eyeliners, when the vision which she first described in its collection book was realized.
Raisman's performance was a rush for the last four years ago when she struggled around the third place, but the bronze medailles went to a helmet to Mustafin.
This time, the 22-year-old men's captain called "Oma" by the Americans had a pre-passion.
After their landwork, she was shocked to the public, overcoming a competitor that sometimes appeared doubtless.
As regards Biles, it has a very new importance for the 19-year-old twit from the beginning of this week:
Police: 3 victims in a series of murders at the music hearing in the car
According to the police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girls were shot in one of the most dead attacks since a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder, while they were in the car and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in an invasion, the authorities said.
The murder fired eight shoes from a handfire weapons while he stood on the car's side and then flew with another vehicle, is to read in the report.
The police reported that the murder had not appeared to be the result of a shooting accident because the slaughter did not compute the hands or the $2.900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooter had the shooter to make a closer view of whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
Overall, seven people were killed and two more in Spain residents within four months in nine attacks.
"It happens in a residence before a house," the KHPO, a daughter company of CBS, shared the beginning of the month.
It is accepted that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a green nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to open the evidence that they made to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and started by the same murder.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of their infringements and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah still burned.
One Witness shared the police that it was not uncommon to sit in a parked car and to hear music.
The authorities also issued a police report on the shooting, which took up a half an hour before the murder three times before the murderer was the work of the series murder.
Searchers found balls and secured a ball from the seat, as well as balls from the motor space.
Mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephaly: "It will be better"
As the majority of the 6-year-olds Edmund Picciouto loves the song, game tools and naturally his mother.
But as the least of his age, Edmund has microcephalie, the result of a genetic disorder, about which his mother Elizabeth Picciouto did not know during her pregnancy.
When he came home the first time, he was my first thanks, I don't do it.
I don't do it.
I didn't let it.
What isn't true -- of course you have left it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and she were informed that Edmund will never be able to recognise them under circumstances and that he may not ever be survived.
Some physicians were even so far that they proposed to institutionalize him.
"My first answer was," I didn't know that the people are still doing," explained Picciouth.
Edmund can walk with help.
Edmund could not sit or crap until his third life year, and he can't even speak.
But he makes slow progress.
He can walk with support and drive.
He also likes to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund thought for "Bite sing something before me."
"We bring him sign language with him," said Piciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical character language - she says, Edmund has created some signs alone.
Microcephalie has a variety of causes: genetics, such as Edmund and infections with virus such as mass or zikavir during pregnancy.
The symptoms and prognoses can strongly vary.
It is too early to say how it will affect life of the cycavirus infected.
Piciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what's going on?
What's going on?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven't asked for a long time after the prognosis because I'm not expecting that she can really tell me someone.
But Piciuto has a hopeful advisory for mothers of males with birth damages caused by zikavirus.
It'll be better.
You know that it's gonna be better for you.
You'll love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfalls, overpowering offers availability to salvation in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfalls and large overflows in Louisiana began the Governor to call the emergency on Friday. It will be calculated over the whole Saturday with more rainfalls.
Many rivers in the south of Louisianas and the south of Mississippi crossed their woods and threatened large overflows to extreme rainfalls, reported the National Water Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards reported that state officers are in permanent contact with the local authorities and are already undergoing assistance to the communities concerned.
Mike GmbH, a speaker for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparation of the Gouverneur, shared the demands for highwater vehicles, boats and sand sacks.
Germany said that only the Tangipao community had requested ten thousand sand sacks.
A overwhelming warning system is used by white parts in the south of Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service was relievable that additional 3 to 5 rain tariffs could fall in this area.
On the south of Alabamas, a flight warning system was established on Friday, while it continued to be reinforced in the mobile area.
The river committee near Baton Rouges and the River Office near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will be reached after the weekend record level.
The meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that the two rivers could overcome many houses near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a stromabwart surrounding in Ascension Parish is a danger, since they are only slowly flying to the lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw river, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached about 09.00 the highest position that has ever been registered.
Reservation teams still offered people from the river water in the districts of Mississippi and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his son, were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which normally stands over 400 feet away from his house, increased overnight.
He told him that another son who lives nearly would have warned him.
"We are waiting and the water stripped and stripped in there," Hansford said.
It reached my size.
Her wife Hansford said she had never seen a such higher height in the river in the 48 years of her life.
Hansford said he and his family members would have all difficulties, and he would be the only one who can smile.
Hansford said that all three novelers had saved in a great military LKW and had brought them to the next firewave, where they were brought to the freeday.
Krautmann said that the overcome was "speaked," since it continued to be serious rainfalls and that the authorities consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a observer reported near Livingstone from Midnight to Thursday morning of 13.75 dry rain.
Krautmann said that the ground was significantly completed by rainfalls since midnight.
The authorities acknowledged that serious rainfalls and road transits caused the salvation of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipaoa Parish and educational deficiencies in five school areas.
The CBS WWL reported that a participant in Tangipaoa 200 was overwhelmed houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which were now both overwhelmed.
The chief of the Commonwealth Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven householders that were buried by highwater.
In the towns of Amite and Hammond, there were nothinces to hide the evacuated.
"If the water starts back, they can return to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the Commonwealth of Tangipaoa, almost two twenty streets were closed because of the high waterstorm and the sand snakes for the people who hope to keep the water from their houses and business.
"The latest overcome we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city management.
This seems to be a similar event.
In Mississipp, the Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Council stated that it continued to rest at the golf coast.
According to his details, a handful house should be reported as overwhelmed on Thursday, but on Friday has not been reported until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I have seen water in places where I never saw it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "Spoke out of balls", survives shoes in Philadelphia
The police shares that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, the second time that a 6-year-old child was shot.
The grandfathers of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandfathers admitted that Brown suffered a number of shocks, including in the lens, skin, arm and bottle, but he was at a consciousness in his transportation in the hospital.
"He's got a lot, his little body was cut off from balls," his grandmother Delors shared the senter.
I can't just believe it.
The state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital house and he had to take several operations.
The family of the boy shared the sender that he was expected to be cured again.
He should start the first class in a local basic school.
Brown was one of the four people shooted in Germany.
At the same time, three men were shot: two in the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical state; the other two victims are, according to CBS Philadelphia, in a stability state.
The kid was shooted on the front of a car together with the 29-year-old boy who is in a critical state, reports the Sender.
The other two victims weren't in the car and the police just identifies whether they could be among one of the lost men of the murder.
The investigator shared the CBS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross fire between several shoes.
Powers for storm weapons, which were followed to different storm weapons, overlooked the slaughter.
It seems that it has been clearly treated for a long-term fight.
On the street, on both sides of the journey, swimming snakes.
So it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very actively involved," the police addressed Anthony Ginaldi to the police in Philadelphia.
There were also several houses and vehicles taken in the area.
There were no arrests, and the police is currently reviewing reports according to the video of monitoring.
On Thursday, another six-year-old girl was taken into arm when she played before her house in the residence of the West Oak Lane.
She's getting back and the police's still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm presenting under the Women Olympic team in the tour and for more than one reason.
First of all, I'm at every summer olympiade since 1984 and the United States have never been so dominant.
And second: This team has three tourners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez that inspired for many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this manity, Aly Raisman, the Jews, and Madison Kocian, which is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This manage eventually reflects the United States.
It has improved the black and Spanish woman‚Äôs presence at the pitches of this sport.
In the past four years, the number was a African American under the women‚Äôs tourners.
Last year, Simone and Gabby #1 and #2 were.
That shows strength.
During the last Olympic games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and jubeled America.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the world's three-fold master Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernadez, as she was expected, but delivered a master-master gemasticroutine.
On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, theerosexual Americanian who won at a individual multi-founding meeting for women.
Member Aly Raisman won Silber.
We experience the spots of this kind of sport, but in this way we don't see the turk loads in the whole country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie have all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.
They're the "last five," because the next Olympic team will only have four tourners in the manner. In addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality seems to be that tourning is a turn sport and the main line of tours in private towers that are maintained by parents, which are used for training, institutions, traveling costs, competition and hotels (for trainers and their families). The list can continue.
The majority of these towers is in a well-being priority that can support the business.
The tourners receive all their training and this is a thorough and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, a trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the tour.
We must even allow the communities to make a more lower and easier touring surgery by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I found my tour office for 20 years.
At my events, we offered free and accessive tours in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Spanish) and trained national and international victory.
In September, we will expand after Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth of high-qualitative tours that will gain the possibility of learning and benefit from these stupid olympic sports.
Turn developed strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.
This combination offers long-term benefits for health and educational and vocational success.
It is the inspiration of this manity that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the tour and that's great.
It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.
It's so sweet time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the wood of the Olympic Manity Gold and thank you, if you have so many young girls with a different background to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunts' proposal
The Ministers hoped that the challenges on the amendments could be completed by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37.000 assistant physicians voted at a choice were delayed.
In July, Hunt plans were enthusiasmed to introduce the treaty and said that the NHS was invaded in a "Neithermandsland" and that any further delay for employees and patients would be harmful.
The first assistant physicians should receive a new treaty which contains changes to night and weekends to improve the work of the works of an unlawful hour.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Committee for Assistant Medicine last night, communicated with a communication: "Assistance physicians have the proposed treaty as serious concerns, especially that it will raise the current involvement crisis and will be decreased to treat all the doctors fairly."
Only eight weeks that remain, until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty, must be made progress and expenditure time.
In view of the efforts made by the BMA to solve conflicts through conversation, the Government has to participate in opposite wildlife and sometimes towards exercising smuggles.
The thing happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month about his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, decrease the angry and talk to the concerns of the physicians."
If he does not do this, the assistants have clearly shown that they are willing to carry out further employment campaigns.
The last strike at the end of April saw an injury of nearly 13,000 rutine operations and 100,000 terms, as physicians and experts were included to provide doctors on the strike posting chain cover.
The Ministers hoped that the fight on the amendments could be completed by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to make a better weekly delay for the 54.000 assistant doctors that are subject to the Treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS employees, requested the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Occupation measures do not achieve any of the few, but they are already overwhelmed teams and services and prepare patients, refugees and their families only concerns, emergency and interruption."
In the last two months, we talked to me to the Committee of Assistant Medicines, with the Ministry of Health and other ministers positively responded to the concerns about predominantity and Whistleblowing.
The employees hoped that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics, such as detection, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from a professional time, training courses, mutual recognition of the education plan, continuing training and sexual privacy in the medicine, were a sign of how serious workers, health education and the Ministry of Health were to meet agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The ¬£2-pro daily medicine that can cause heart infarctic risk
Thousands of heart-infarct patients are benefited from a ¬£2-day medication after recommended by the authorities to accept this more people for a longer period.
Ticagrelor medication reduces the risk of repeated heart infections for persons with heart disease.
The medication is administered for 12 months after a heart infarction, which reduces the risk of slaughtering accident or another heart infarct.
The NHS Regulatory Authority has recommended a period of four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS Regulatory Authority has recommended a period of four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
round 140,000 people each year experience a heart infarction and a fourth of them experience another heart infarct or a slaughter accident.
heart infarcts and slaughter accidents are caused by assemblies of fat materials in the arterian walls that form the smells.
If the beag interferes, it may cause a blood blood blood insected to heart and cause heart infarcts.
If the blood nervous is solved, it can flee through the blood strom and hide the blood flow to the brain, which causes a smoke accident.
Those who have already had a heart infarction have a higher risk.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the commercial names of Brilica, reduces this risk by making it more likely to be trained by blood nerves.
The NICE Guide Project, which has been published today, recommends a 12-month receipt of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily receipt of aspirine for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "In view of the availability of secondary prevention, a fourth of all who have suffered a heart-infarction, another heart-infarction or a slaughter accident - often with extreme consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart infarction may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
The experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing other heart infarcts and slaughter cases in people who already had a heart-infarction.
With a provisional recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased to expand available treatment options to thousands of people that can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor, especially the blood risk, is limited to a period of up to three years. The guideline project recommends no treatment that depends on this period.
Cultural of Political Correctity allows election fraud to be cut in muslim areas
The former Chief of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman has been removed last year on the event of a government report because of corruption from the office.
A culture of the Political Correctness has resulted in the knowledge of wide election fraud in muslim communities as a devastating government report today.
The former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles stripped the police, election observers and advisors to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse because of "exceptivenesses regarding Etnia and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Community Government, who is now a King of Corruption, said that the threat of elections from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set out countries outside the electoral cabines to protect assaulted elections.
It recommends that the choicers should conduct a reference to themselves to demonstrate their identity in elections.
At the time, a choiceer must only call his name and address.
The report proposes that not removed thresholds on the finger of a person if they leave their votes to prevent someone to choose two times.
Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for more access to common documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
"This does not only serve against election, but also to protect the common government before the broader corruption and financial drug culture, which is income," he said.
The report was ordered by the Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's Election Canal in East London.
Last year, a special vote decided that the official master Lutfur Rahman should be deleted after a Lithuania in corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court claimed that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a zynological way," and that he had caused his critics with racism and Islamic admissions.
Rahman was intended to "her campaign on the basis that it is the reliable obligation of Muslims to choose him".
Up to 300 votes were doubtless or the consequences of a post which a person chose as someone else.
Sir Eric said it was proof of fraud in the whole country.
In particular, he expressed an alertive to the betrage's letter election - in the elderly members of the Muslim Community pressure to choose a candidate for their choice.
Sir Eric, trained, made several recommendations to cut the selection system, including the leadership of instructions to prove the identity
The report states: "All evidence has been made that the pressure on the protection of certain ethnic minorities has been exercised, particularly women and young people, to choose in accordance with the will of the elders, especially communities with Pakistanian or Francodesh background.
"It was worried that... public institutions would have ignored such a behavior because of "politically corrected" overcome in respect of Ethia and religion."
Sir Eric expressed 50 recommendations to cut the system, including the prohibition of editing political active letters to stop "Women".
The report to be considered by Theresa May also requires worse registration reviews to prevent the electoral directory of immigration and social drugs.
View options to ask the choice before the selection after your reference.
Use not removed tits on the finger of a person when she left her voice to prevent someone choose two times.
To conduct systematic reviews on nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are entitled.
A three-year limitation of applications to an automatic letter selection.
Prohibition that political activers edit full letter choices and cuttings of letters.
The police gives the power to establish restrictions for election stations.
An amendment of law which facilitates a complaint for infringement in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksverslation Act 1983).
Photographic ban in selection stations.
Requests to be used only in English in the election stations (except Wales).
Intensifying the training to ensure that the employees apply the rules that the choiceers are only in the selection box.
Sir Eric spends over the Metropolitan police and finds it "surprising," that after the Tower Hamlet's case, there was no criminality.
"The election court declared Lutfur Rahman and his council because of a Lithuania of corrupt and illegal practices", he said.
It has been acknowledged due to a number of reasons for sufficientness - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings -.
He also criticizes the uneffective "abject controls" of the Council's registering departments.
Sir Eric said, "The court court in Tower Hamlets was a warning signal last year.
Our country, as the mother of Parliament, is a proud heritage, but the careful and comprehensive expansion of election fraud and leakage of some authorities threatens this good call.

CBC commentary for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimming pool "Come killed a skin"
Byron MacDonald's analysis on the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m free-speed staff recommended viewers of the CBC level transmission of Olmyptic games at midnight
The Canadian sender CBC had to apologize after one of his comments said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimming pool "comme Mief" and during the rener as "un sweet died."
Commenter Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was disabled when he was to give his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-style stage.
MacDonald, who was obtained in the commentary of the CBS on board to give more color, could be heard: "This small 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."

Thank you for it.

Viewers reacted fast online after they were shocked from the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimming from China "Where is a skin died?"?
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on sending."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free-sleeping stage for women: "This small 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard in which many were talking to him
Twitter users did not stand back when they heard how unsensibel Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists. #angekel.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who modernized the CBC sending, lived for the comment of MacDonald and said, "We apologize that the comment was extracted over a slight performance."
It was a unfortunately chosen formulation, it's sorry that it happened."
CBC regretted about 90 times in the people who responded to Twitter's comment.
The commentary College Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and inserted his apologize with more than 90 other Twitter users who were dealing with MacDonald's comments
The network also dismissed quickly and gave a communication.
We regret that these complaints have been made and that they were allowed to be extracted.
Last night we were soon apologizing with our observers on sending and followers in social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments relate to the performance of the swimming pool and not to them as a person.
However, they were inadequate and unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron does what he said is very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald regreted himself in the sending and tried to justify his comment by he said that it was not his hope that it would be issued as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize a moment for the comment that I made after the women's swimming stage in the CBC Olympication, he said.
"I've taken me on the performance of the snake and not on them as a person."
Of course, it wasn't inclined to misunderstanding and I'm very sorry."

How to protect Krav Maga against arms attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make him something more secure for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to run with armed robbers closely removed.
Independence on whether you are closed from front or down, this video will show you how you turn the sword for your skin.
If you get closed from down, then you should turn around as first, so you can see your angryers and "sir from the shooting line", Mizrachi says.
Then take the weapons between your frontarm and your shooter before you shoot him with your free helbogen face.
Shut him up with the skin into the shoes and turn back while the smells swimming up for pain, the weapons out of his hands. Shut him into the face and move back while they put the weapons on him.
With anxiety closer to the front, the technology is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, take the weapons and turn it up so that the shooter can't shoot them.
Reduce the weight on the weapons and shoot the weapon on the breast, then turn the weapons out of his griff before they move back and put the weapons on it.
It's hard?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is.
But you think it's the safeest to overcome your money - if you are no Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveller Ian Wright spends his language to the most comfortable places of Europe for a traveller
A British traveller understood his immune system and flexibility of a serious test - by cutting some of the most sweet and exciting places of Europe.
The modernist and traveller Ian Wright, 51 Suffolk from Suffolk was on a euro-sheet, a country at Piccadilly Circus, a wheel button as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.
Before the denix of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he would be allowed.
But the experience, which was formed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results in daily light.
The gratitude to switch the smuggle button that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely shocked, but actually is in a kitchen kitchen ball more bad bacteria.
At his trip through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of Darbateries and his own health.
Unfortunately, nothing left that he turned away, more than a bad sequence in the mouth.
Mr Wright was known to test the resistance of his darkness by he traveled through the world and eats its own and wonderful things.
From public countries to rail shops, the task of the immune system was definitively under a test.
In the movie he said, "I was pretty concerned about my health and I stole all the possible things in my mouth, earth, wolf and water."
In the movie, he was just asking for every case.
The only thing he rejected was a smooth public toilet in Russia.
His trial showed a number of luminometers of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to turn away after their luminometer number over 4000 units, while fresh hands show one of less than 60.
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacteria number of places in different places than the bathroom
In the film he says, "This is the worst thing I smokeed in a toilet, nearly."
There's nothing more funny than that!
I'm not going to do anything here, because it's awesome in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.
The company allows Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of Darbateries and Immun systems.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Snacks and New Categories Niko Kaurenmaa says: "We wanted to really offer the consumers something new.
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time declares the advantages of probiotics.
We conducted crazy brain turmings that ended that we said, "Let call us Ian."
They said that the interest in dark health will be a global phenomenon.
Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of dark health and how it is connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in dark health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film, we could provide the consumers more information in a interesting way.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense for Humor!
Tom Hakala, who led to the film region, added: "Let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had chosen some of the things I told him to lift, as the excited Russian toilet that was shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to bring Ian, to shoot them, and others that were very difficult.
I am glad we have taken some of these smiling leckers on the film."
In a 2015 survey of Valio, 84 per cent of all demanded milk acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of magn and darm and 58 per cent, said that they used at least available products containing milk acid bacteria.
Social family destroyed in Saltash, Cornwall
A associational family left their social housing after a delogation with a damage of 500,000 ¬£, because they terrorised their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were captured after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their presence, shocked accommodations of the accommodation were found in an irreparable condition.
The walls shocked woods, wood sleeves were shocked, the mould was cut on the foot and the graphite was shocked on the wall.
The families were turned up and it will be accepted that they live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who worked for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment was not reparing.
She said, "It was a absolute dinner room for people here and I am thinking that people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to be taken into account, since this present is probably to be viewed as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is humble, and her call is also.
The couple had three sons who lived interimly in the apartment and the police said that the terrorism that the family had added was struggling streets with baseball slaughterers, shocks of habitats, drug abuse, drug traffic and excessive crystals, riders and shocks.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the Meeting Treaty, was in June a order for anti-social behavior.
In some places of the house that is deleted under circumstances, old mull was found
There was a place in which drugs were treated in the past, the woods were discovered.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing declared her and her partners violently from the presence this week after she gave them a extended period of 11 weeks to go voluntary.
The delogation was jumped by the easy neighbors who said that their life was made to hell.
One said, "They were shocking for no one."
We lived 20 years next to them, and it was always bad.
The incredible times we say the police here are incredibly.
"We couldn't sleep tomorrow."
We stopped because it was so calm here - that's not we live!
Now where they are finally away, it's gonna be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have cooperated with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house in which the police was called in regular distances, 20 years
On the overwhelming side of the community house, the mould and old game tools were understood
He added: "It's a shame that the midder summoned, any responsibility for her behaviour and accepting her family, as a description is always the last step that the Cornwall Housing is in consideration.
This was a very difficult case, since the behaviour of the behavior was extreme and their acts were terriblely communicated for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as the members of the community who have been courageously attended to us and have allowed us the information.
I hope that this development will be rejoiced by some neighbors and that the message is not tolerated by anti-social behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in different times in the house, but they were all over 20.
A smooth matrix that was left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the ground
Employees of the house management will now be able to displace M√ºllbergs around the house
2014 the police carried a razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis, and vagina, paraphernalians and bargeld higher than ¬£1.700.
Skeldon received a currency sentence after her ownership of a drug of class B was accused of trade.
She stated that the money for a Grabstone is Lee Skeldon's son, who came to life in 2013 at a car accident.
After they were without Obdach, Tanya and her partner now lived in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the room walls of the house were shocked with Graffiti.
The police said she will delay members who do not hold on the budget regulation.
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall reported that the delocation is a clear warning to the other members who are not at the budget.
"This is about those who think that they can be taken without self-conspiration and to those who have been damaged by such a behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviors that will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal in Panik after a deep military ship overseas
Solar employees in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their life
A portugu√™s P-3C Orion flight of the aircraft led to an incredible shock flight
Airlines acknowledged that it was on a train flight, but claimed that no security risk was presented.
This was the moment when the decreased tourists began to be born in panic after a deep jet cut down over a full beach.
Dramatic video records showed how the military flight aircraft was almost slowly close to the sun providers on the Strandquarter in Aero in North Portugal.
The vacants are shocking when they are understood to make concerns about the smell of the tears, without first seeing what happened by the clouds to them.
The incident occurred afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacants who posted the videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said, "It's been very deeply over two times and there was a moment as it looked like it would be cutting it."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just on the circle, and it felt like the flight would turn away to me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were moved to Panik when the aircraft came from the darkness and incredibly flew deeply
The Portuguese airlines today acknowledged that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a train flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so deeply flighted that this was the only possibility to recognise it.
The speaker said that the Jet was deeply shocking because of the bad visibility of the area nearly, but the airway forces argued that security was no time threatened.
Area burdens have destroyed the portugu√™s Festland parts of this summer, with four people on Madeira Island also died.
The portugu√™s airlines today pointed out that the pilot was due to the situation - a strong nest and smoke - so deeply flying, what limited his view.
The aircraft was on a train flight where the pilot was to identify the pilot as a part of the practice.
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Sevilla
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first step to the first title win in the new football season.

Furthermore, Goalie Marc-And is missing in stage.
In the training, the Germans experience a landscape in the kit, which was at least declared to the Barca's request at least first for Claudio Bravo.
The Chile International and Ter Stegen in Barcelona has been the status of one number for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique reproved this towards a clear decision and left Bravo in the Liga, but in this way Teres in most of the other claims.
Before the first game of the new game period, there are doubts about the fitness state of the manity that was sustained on Saturday in a Liverpool test game with 0:4.
Also in Probegalopp 3:2, Lionel Messi and Co. were not really convinced.

Ma Long in a own link to Tischtennis-Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Tischtennis Olympioner.
The 27-year-old age in Rio de Janeiro was a single final of his countryman and "Defenderer" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4.4).
For this reason, the Worldrange Listers had the "Golden Grand Slam" with success in WM, Worldcup, World Tour Financialists and also Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chineses have done it as expected in the end game and made the title one another.
This was clear that, for the third time, a Chinese would take the individual title in the sign of the fifth ring.
The last non-Chine on the top of the Olympic Trip was the former SVS-N√É-Legionar Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the rates and at time-outs they had no coachs with themselves.
They had turned back to the tribunes and left their shooters in a good competition fight alone.
"I've played the matchs until here for my country."
"I'm the Finale I play for me," Zhang had sincerely said.
After the party, gold and silver medal winners were posted with the Chinese farm.
The match itself was unexpectedly unexpected.
But his 28-year-old enemy had to fight only in the first word.
Then he determined the time at the plate and left a total of 13 points.
With the overwhelming of Ma, the expected match was not developed.
Nevertheless, there was no sufficient switch to see.
Mizutani wins the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Wladimir Samsow 4:1.
In his fourth final, the white ceremonies had a grip injured to the German European master Dimitri Ovtcharov, and then was in medical treatment, and he had to "last" to be seen with blonde.
The Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and J√∂rgen Persson (42/2008) were otherwise become similarly higher tissues of Olympia.
Donald Trump empty problems in the election campaign
The leadership of the United States Republicans is cut by massive concerns, including in traditional conservative states.
President Donald Trump now gave the weakness of his election campaign in the former Republic of Utah.
A rare moment in which multimillionarys who were normally large and self-security expressed something like the concerns reported by the correspondents.
After he cast 16 rivals from the rain within his own Republicans, the doubts now increased in his success in the fight against the White House.
"We have great problems in Utah," said Trump before evangelical Christians, who asked him for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Bads have been wrong reports about his candidature, he reacted his known media schools again.
Watching the Republic of Hochburg
Utah is normally a safe bank for the Republicans.
A SurveyUSA survey from June was the Trump and his competitor from the Democratics, Hillary Clinton.
Other institutions see the trumpet before, however, not with the distance which is common for the Republican candidates in the State.
Arizona and Georgia are also dangerous.
In an interview of the Senator CNBC, Trump answered the question, how he wanted to stop the Clinton's premargin: "Genause how I did it until now."
And go back: "It's going to be successful, or I'll make a very beautiful, long holiday."
He does nothing else than "to tell the truth."
If it is not rich for him at the end of the political correction, it would be okay, Trump continued.
Then I'll come back to a very good way of life.
According to the press reports, the party would have threatened Trump to strike money to support his election campaign, he should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead of that, the candidates of the Republicans would like to be stronger among the arms.
Olympia: Three fraud at Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a discipline committee in the case.
Kenias Leichtathletes threatens the second doping offers at the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro Ungeach.
After a fraud survey at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenia sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee communicated to set up a discipline committee immediately to investigate the case.
A Kenian official reported that the former speech and today's coach, John Anzrah, had issued an Urin test in the Olympic village in the name of the 800-metre-four Ferguson Rotich.
This is reported by the Kenias team by the Doping Control Controls.
The IAAF World Association has requested the IOC information on the case to stretch its own investigations with a IAAF speaker.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC will be assessed by the IAAF," said in an IAAF statement.
"Her (Anzrah) went to the Doup Conpulsion Station and was deleted as Ferguson Rotich, issued and signed the test," Kenias Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi explained.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list of training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich was born in 2015 in Peking WM-Vettator over 800 meters.
Four days ago, the Kenyan Leastletic Delegation Chief Michael Rotich was taken from the Rio games.
He should have informed against money payers of his country about the existing doping tests.
According to media reports, it should be arrested when he returned to the Nairobi airport.
Kenya has already been under special observance for many Doping procedures in the IOC.
In the announcement of more than 2000 Doping target controls provided by the IOC, it was uncommonly indicated that attorneys from Kenia and Russia were taken into view.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had performed a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping site and a functioning control system before the summer games in Brazil.
The law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia begins.
The WADA Kenya took the list of countries whose Doping combating is in compliance with WADA rules.
Kenya's as a great swimming nation.
In the 2015 WM in Peking the largest medailles of the country wins.
In a number of RRD television reports, it has always been proposed that the average of the Doping is easily available in Kenia and that it should provide a significant intellectuality of the sports rape.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had established them in the Russian light-artist.
It could be demonstrated that in this type of sport it was slowly and systematically baptized.
Russia's slight-to-scale were excluded from the summer games.

It's a wonderful mix, the perfect reception for our orchester.
I would say that we've really got a music in our blood!
In this incense Bartoli plays a older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the young Maria plays and dance.
Mary's role has always shown me fascinated.
First of all, because she is extremely musical!
And then Maria's personality would be there.
She says in her song, "I feel beautiful, oh so beautiful, I feel beautiful, sweet and bright."
So she is ridicule, of course also naive, and very painful.
"He looks like me, my Italian character that I have as a Roman," says Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of the glory of the Oper song: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist".
It's such a honor to work with us.
She's an unforgettable man.
And Bartoli returns the complement: "Double is such an extraordinary artist and very painful!"

You look at it in every movement, in his eyes, it's his life!
It's so a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a very South temperature, a fire, a painfulness and also a joyful approach to life, which is really very important!
For the American government Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side History" is currently highlighted: "In this part it is about prejudices and fanatism."
Today, we have the refugees, then the Porto Ricanes went to New York, and the New York people did not want them.
It's the same topics, and they're exactly exactly today.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.

Treats wants Nackt Calendar for "women and men"
The Treats Magazine works together with the photograph David Belmerre for a 1970-year-old-pirelli-inspirit calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous nacking people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Museum Calendar for 2017.
The director of Traats Steve Shaw told us the beginning of this year that his nackt-magazine was different from the old-school platboys, because "Playboy is for men".

Turkish: Curdic community calculated with mass flight
"Whoever does not adjust and glorify Erdogan, sits on packed coffers," says the President of the nearby Fondation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Curdic Community Germany has shortly calculated with ten thousand visitors flying from Turkey to Germany.
In the mid-term, it could even become "one hundreds of thousands", believed by the President of the Association Ali Toprak.
In view of the heartful action of the President of Turkey Recep Tayip Erdogan, the Kurd community expects a mass flight to Germany.
"Along with ten thousands, medium-term, with hundreds of thousands of protection demands from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the partner Ali Toprak of the "What".
Since the government has overwhelmed the Curdian Highburgs with penalties for months ago, 500,000 curves within Turkey have been fled.
After the digest, nor add to sculpture and oppositional ethnical towers.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are continued to be stressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a State that takes refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The Head of Association declared the targeted seat of Syrian Arabians in curdic but also in alevitic cities.
In this way, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining rates.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Army and Greek were already destroyed or destroyed in the past hundreds of years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The Head of Association requested that the federal government "speaked as Austria against Erdogan and its members".
In Germany there is also a "hexenjagd" against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe for the first time in Germany in the last months.
The German branch of the Gelen movement also fears the fleet of many towers in the foreign.
More turbulents will search for asylum in Germany, especially cords and oppositions.
The brandmarking as Gelen attachors destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
"Whoever does not adjust and glorify Erdogan, sits on packed coffers, otherwise the Kemalians and Sekularians," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Neighbouring Foundation Dialoge and Education, "the World."
As reported by the newspaper on numbers of the Federal Ministry, the Turks already placed the largest group of asylum authors for political persecution in Germany before the Putsch.
On Thursday 30 June, this was 11.386 people and thus 29% of all asylum acknowledged persons (39.625).
In this encouraging, the war, poverty or perspectiveness cannot be fled.
Asylum right under the basic law is only politically, by state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg fronts: "It go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg frontiers: The homes do not receive anything from summer wave with - and the vacants from Northern Western-Westfalts may not choose the landday.
They understood in Mecklenburg.
2021 the vote of the Sunday will not be taken directly at the end of the summer feasts, and the Schwarze Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
For more than ever, it's not: summer vacation, heat and solar battle, that's helpful.
The locals who should be convinced by the chosen combaters are in vacation.
The most largest holidays in the country, on use, swimming or hiddensee through the land, are not inhabited, therefore don't have to choose the landday.
There are practical problems: In the holidays there are helpers to cut the places, put air balls, distribute fleet and finally split vows, just swimming hard.
Up to September 4th, 2016, the Last and Feast Day, the Mecklenburg Championship has to be held by the people.
The warm phase, if you can say it, has just started.
And it's also about something: President Erwin Sellering, the leader of a SPD/DCU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, since 1998 the strongest party, is now clearly behind the CDU.
It is shocking how strong new ADD declines and what remains at the end of coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008, makes a nearly unexpected election campaign, looks out of his grand placates.
He travels through the country, distributes Roses and enjoys a little with the people, as he did his legendary slaughter Harald Ringstorff.
On the other hand, Sealering has obtained cold feet and offers Kanzler Merkel the debt in the fall of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, you "We make it", has accelerated the increase in the legal populations, which is probably now the beautiful office.
The CDU with its picscandidates, the Minister of Internal Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you are making a wrong time on the right place of choice.
She has invited Kansler Angela Merkel two times to grandcomings; the centre of the Federal Day is located in the northern.
But the target group did not have to be true, there were more North Rhine-Westphalens, Berliners and Sachsen since it was Mecklenburgers and Prepomers.
"That was probably the majority of other federal countries," Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDD in Mecklenburg, recently claimed in NDR.
But there is also no harm of any other sides of Germany to hear Angela Merkel.
On the other hand, the Northern CDU is widely refusing to the ordinary election campaigns on market places and prior to purchasing centres with sun screens and airballs.
That means cokert just plays a "subdesigned role".
The Union has also noted that you will remove the base on the country that it has to be very strict to find the people again.
You're like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there's no place in the west of the country.
However, the Council of the CDU fighter Kokert is also self-reaching: "They must go where it hurts, namely where people are villages, golden weddings, every birthday feast is to be used."
Because many are on the game, Sellerring has now called his SPD to a specially engaged campaign.
In surveys, social democracy was 22% behind the CDU (25) partners, just before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still winned 35.6% before the CDU (22).
The green, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, would have to create the swimming day.
You're making a modern attraction from the holiday note and bringing their selection campaign largely into the Internet.
"Online-Wailbox" is named Chairman Claudia M√ºller.
Instead, green choosing fighters are allowed to search for incoming urbans under the holidays.
Silke Gajek, the Spitzencandidat, runs with a house boat through the Mexileburg Sea and finds it still beautiful.
Your impression: "The vacation in Mecklenburg is not punishment."
B27: guest stations suffer under sperling
The speed with which B 27 is sanctified, there is nothing to meat.
For the responsibilities of the construction work that starts at 5:30 a.m. and ends only before 20 o'clock, there is half of lob.
"They have done everything quite fascinated," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet channel.
It's a super team.
There is no ban.
The building was able to be planned at the start of the week to the south until October ends.
It will also be grateful to the income of the construction works responsible for the establishment of aid finances.
Since the building was changed in the south of the Monday and the slope of the aspergstrates was also decreased in a distance and thus the connection to Rotenburg has also been re-established, the transport site has been distant.
Citizens can now re-interrupte from the B 27 offenders.
It seems to be back to the shipment through the place.
"That was partly significant complaints," said the principal director of the Sanctions Officer Florian King, responsible for the transport technology management.
The populations of bath pockets, stone stoneways, ports and Weiherrain had to fight with more transport temperatures because they were searching for many swimming roads and confidenced in their Navis more than the decision.
What resulted from some of the Lkws in residence areas.
As the speed limits were not maintained, the Community requested the measuring vehicle to increase.
"There were significant overwhelmings," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation.
There's been two-thirds per minute.
The fastest was 77 miles per hour in the time-30 zone.
Since the building has continued, it should be more calm.
For business work at B 27, it is just a small comfort that is now open for customers from Rottenburg.
Look at the cards do not like business shops.
But that the B 27-sensitive has led to overwhelming injuries with them, everyone who you ask is able to see.
However, some are more and less affected.
Those who have to do less to do with the "find", so produce for other companies, have few consequences for the sanction.
In the car house Mayer, Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "leapest decline", but it is also that "the lack of training".
The most powerful sites are the places along the street.
J. Albert G√∂hner, Head of the Steakhouse, Krone forms, finds clear words.
This is already threatening.
Not just him, but all the guests have hit it hard.
The customers were missing from heatings, ballings and rottweil.
We must be glad about every euro relocation.
The income is "wise than 50 percent".
The road sanction has been "returned for two years".
The half of his employees had to leave.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would be left, the policy would be differently reacted.
Instead, President J√∂rg Schmidt has requested a detainee, whether it could give a financial compensation with the indication that the guest position benefits other than the benefits of the situation at the B 27. Now they should also bring the parts that are given by sanctions.
He knows other land crystals where something was handled more swimming.
In all kitchens, he is sure that his guests will continue.
Finally, the family business has been set here since 1715, and he refers to the long history.
That other stakeholders now are less often previewed because of complex transportation, it can understand.
If you can't come out, it's nice.
In order to return to his stake clients after the end of sanction work, the gods have no doubt.
In spite of the crisis with BSE and birdgrippe, demons the impact of B 27-bauworks on its clientship for the biggest crisis that has experienced his guest station in their long-year history.
Six months of construction, that's a brutal thing.
Forever, in behalf of the fight against terrorism, legislation is disrupted.
According to the recent proposals, the Minister of Industry presents a wide security package.
But what's a duplication status to do with terrorism?
And what's the coalition partner say to all of that?
Thomas de Maizi√®re gives the ancestor.
All of its proposals are "politically useful" to the coalition partner, the Federal Minister states that the new security package is designed.
They're not demanding anybody.
Other, continuing points would first be discussed within the parties.
I also participate in it.
But as the Minister of Internal Affairs, he is located on results and to a "reasonable consensus" within the coalition.
The Maizi√®re has left some time after the recent consultations in Wurzburg and Ansbach before he presented its conclusions for security in the Republic.
But these are now more extensive.
Some are already known, proclaimed, assigned, that a new security authority is intended to care for the cuts encrypted communication is not new.
It is not also the fact that Germany must implement several EU proposals on flight data and arms law.
The call after more video oversight and staff for security authorities is also not surprised.
In part, the Maizi√®re starts a second start of proposals that were not to be made with the SPD: he wants to punish the sympathy for terrorist groups and punish the Dschihadists with a double state citizenship.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man enters.
However, he did not have any chance for the coalition partner.
A few new ideas also present the Maizi√®re.
They are partly in themselves: he plants rapid procedures for decisions and more opportunities to arrest people before the decision.
Refugees who are targeted to assist in the country should before check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security review.
In the case of debts for rejected asylum applicants, he wants to make some of them worse than until long - some of those who act on crimes or to remove their papers with awareness of their identity.
Some of them are political and legally heavy.
Some are still insufficient and letting questions open.
And in some points, for example, the question is: what does this actually have to do with security and terrorism?
Yes, the Major says it's important to differ between refugees and terrorism.
But it couldn't be denied that the murderers of Ansbach and W√ºrzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people faced high refugees concerns for security.
And things that the people were deeply occupied now do not have to declare themselves at the time of election.
The internal security has been shocked into the focus.
First of the advice in the neighborhood: Paris, Kopenhagen, Brussels, Nizza.
Then the attacks in Wurzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is great.
And yes, there's a choice fight.
The Union and the SPD, therefore, are increasingly in position towards internal security.
In the past days, there was high among the two parties.
First, a warm fight on the provision of the Federal Police, then on a assembly of security policy ideas of certain ministers of the Union, where the Heads of Resort also call for a Burka ban and a decrease of the double state citizenship.
The Majesty also wants to be here for deceasing tones.
He didn't think anything of a double pass.
We have satisfied the debate in Germany.
You can't stop, don't be sensitive.
And with a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is at all sides of constitutional feast and whether it's really "supportable" for the coalition partner, it's still need to be shown.
It's covered in some of the things that could be careful for the war.
However, the SPD is currently trying to profile internal security on the subject.
Participant Sigmar Gabriel just states a careful conversation and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that is involved to increase security."
People's car is still slowly running.
Despite that chandals, the expense numbers are increased in the world.
But it does not run around in all markets.
In the back-up action, there is a term of a term.
People's car starts in the second half year of delivery.
In the past year, the largest automobile of Europe can continue to be more, despite the ladders, thanks to its many brands and some good markets.
However, in July, the VW Kernmark was slower, especially in Western Europe, and was deceived by the total sale, as notified in Dax.
Worldwide, the brand VW sold in July with 449100 cars 1,8% less vehicles than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, in China's double market, the sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market, the supplies were almost a seventh set up in Germany.
Market sales chief J√ºrgen Stackmann brought the weakest numbers from July in particular to two sales days less in Europe.
Furthermore, in some key markets, it has provided a purchase in the "changed economic framework" market.
In addition to the situation around the swimming pool in Turkey, the British vote on exit from the EU also explained a speaker.
In the U.S., where the excalars were first scattered, a minute in Buche is also a minute.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
In total, the main housemarks of the Niedersachsen are still slowly involved by the steel chandal: After the first seven months, only a mining of 0.9% to 3.37 million vehicles is in Buche.
Concern sales chief Fred Kappler could also submit a sales exceeding from January to July.
1.3 per cent of more vehicles delivered people from this time, 5.904 million in the world.
People's car manipulated with a software abgas test.
Only in Germany VW calls about 2,5 million cars to rebuild in the workplaces.
In the way of the rearing, VW reaffirmed that the rebuilding of the cars has no negative effect.
After the rebuilding of the vehicles, there is no deterioration for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor service.
The auto-building has an "equal guarantee" certificate by the customers after the rebuilding, but not speak of a "garantie", as it was called on Friday in business creatures.
The reason for legal fellowships.
The "Focus" had reported that a popular car provides his German customers now a guarantee for swimming celestial models.
This had been confirmed last Monday VW Deputy in the Federal Transport Ministry.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was a meeting.
"VW has to completely comply with the installations of my Commission and the KBA."
"The derogations are not accepted," said the Federal Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) under the Ministry.
The VW has agreed that there is no degradation in the consumption of fuel, CO2 emissions or motor power after the rebuilding and that all type-approval vehicle values have unchanged.
People's car itself uses the term "Garantie" but not how it was called in enterprises.
In the wide term "Garantie" the people's car is the possibility that customers, for example, come in a half year after the installation of a motor chain - and that could return to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do.
It is also important to avoid that there are other damages that have nothing to do with the disappearing channel in respect of possible assurance schemes, as it was called.
Therefore, the term "Garantie" does not declare VW.
The Raifisenbank Gmund at the Tegernsee requires rich sparors in the future - as the second institution in Germany.
Bank Chief Josef Paul said on Thursday, "It's only about 139 customers that park 40 million euros on Giro or daily payment accounts."
The Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal: normal spaers should not be afraid to pay for their sparrow punishment.
If banks pay money by night at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay for 0.4 per cent of the criminality.
This expenditure requires the Gmund Railfeisen Bank to return from September from private and enterprises for funds over 100,000 euros to payment accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs in future 400 euros in the year," said Paul.
He stood 40 million euros from a day to the other and could not be evaluated.
"They are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4% of costs," said the bank head.
"I can't add $4,000 for every million."
The costs are now continued in accordance with the principle of insurance.
The bargel's only to leave the shoes of the rail bank would be too dangerous: "I've already experienced four accidents, I don't like the fifth," said the Bank's position.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other installations.
Only few turned to other banks.
Bayern's Joint Association stated: "The extreme monetary course of the ECB has caused significant costs in all banks."
It is not possible to bring it alone to be "even-depthly operational".
Some German banks therefore increased their costs for accounting, credit cards or transfers.
The Trilinger Popular and Rafficinant Bank Altenburger Land had with its Skatbank-Filial 2014 with penalties for installations from three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, Headquarters of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect privacy to pay low payment for funds, so the competition in Germany is too strong under banks and Spain casses."
One banker said, at the Tegern Sea there is "A customer that has been equipped with the ownership something more widespread."
"This can be a problem for a small bank," if they find free money.
The 1911 Community Bank Gmund has furniture in Bad Wiessee, Rottach egers, Creuth and Tegernsee.
In the region, famous players, sportors and entrepreneurs are located.
The Bayern Community Association "before there are no further banks that calculate an expenditure for privacy insurance", said the speaker.
The President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Railfeisen Banks (BVR), Your Fr√∂hlich, declared the end of June: "The slight to go to the negative towards the private work is very high."
The competitiveness is hard, and it threatens the immigration of employees to competitiveness.
The customers in Germany will not be allowed to delay it in the width.
Destination plates: Who actually buys shoot plates?
One man in a medium age loves plates.
Before you embrace the comment to overcome it under the Pseudonym NonAlleAinsemenMendersMethoduals with sweet drivings, this statement depends on the current data.
According to YouGov, the many declared resurrection of skin plates is not to a tree in Millennium which wants to welcome the news of physical objects, but to return to Midlife Nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a plate are all prospectives according to the age between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most probable buyer group.
It is also not horns by hobby-amers - it has an emotive importance: older plate buyers keep their feelings better for themselves (56% s. 53%) and enjoy it to carry only time (69% vs. 66%).
But do you agree with the results of yourGov?
If this blog would be a TV news report, the camera would follow me, while I walk in a busy street in Soho, spend a skilled grey shoot and sign a wild shock before I stayed, my hands stand and say something decisive as: "But, let us shoot a closer look at this."
So let us look up.
Even if the heart of Sohos slowly covered in his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which one of the independent salers was slowly covered - there is a handly fantastic plate-specific business.
I would like to ask the camera to disable the camera for the next part, in which I stand directly close to different men in such business and try to evaluate her age and beauty by observing.
Steart from Glasgow, 55 whom I follow by Sister Ray (Datean number: two young women, three men age) in the Reckless Records (data number: eight men average age, a woman, probably around 20), is a day because of a meeting in London and goes through business to fill the few hours.
He's a Sammler, can I ask?
"I think it's right," he says.
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.
These ball plates, drawn up (he sent me the shuttle by email, I didn't follow him home), clothes out the walls of his living rooms.
The reason why he has such a huge number of alben and Singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy places that he couldn't give up when they appeared and buy it again, when he was young and pleasant.
"My things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Its things I probably were too young to buy me," he said.
It is true that those who purchase the plates are more introverted and desired to spend only time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
It's my laster.
Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he is going to meet youGov profile.
However, he has also noted a new wave of people who are influenced by the media help, people who have heard about the come back and seen themselves to buy their old plates again.
From the discussions I've held, people have normally completed their collection by 1998 or 1999.
Customers who first sold their plates to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to repay their plates," he says.
This would explain the tree to adherents of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what is the emotional importance of plates?
It is only a few seconds in a business such as Phonica to recognize that plate business offers a peaceful community of equivalents.
According to Wez, some of the elderly customers accepted the uncontact payment system.
Some platefans feel overcome from the digital world and want to turn back to the stability of confidenced platforms, from objects that are watching a happy youth angry.
"I think sometimes it can be the fulfilment of a empty or the possession of material possessors as a kind of comfort," Wez says.
It's me as a Sammler, and I think it's like a lot of people.
It's a simpler way to work spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" a employee from a platform.
A survey of the ICM in April understood that almost 50% of the people who have purchased a place in the last month have not heard.
The survey also found that 41% have a plate player that they never used, while 7% of those who buy a plate have no plate players.
At this time of the news report, I would probably be very concerned, while I'd blow through a stapel at Bossa New Complections.
Johnny, 42 who works at Sounds of the universe (Datean number: three men average age) has noted a "trophene spectrum" of the Revival.
"Another one came in here recently and said, "I don't have plate players, but I would like to buy a radiohead ball plate so I can put them in the regal," he said.
This is not a large percentage, but it is definitely happening.
More productive, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have plate players."
These are young people, not older, who first come in slowly.
Fopp, who had almost a whole eye of the ball plates, has a good public when I go.
There are couples around the 70th, tourists, photos, adolescents and women age.
Even if the atmosphere is something less disappointed than in the previous businesses - Wild Beasts's new synthesizer and sex packing pop instead of experimental Jazz drew from the sound speaker - it's good to see such diversity in the customers.
Nobody else seems to be alone, but neighbouring psychological traumas are difficult to determine if you are close to someone 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, runs over a few minutes in the business and considers the variation of the places for sale.
She makes a slaughter boom than a big invasion.
She does not pay much, so the collection of plates is not real option, she says.
It costs much.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or on another way, but the beauty of plates is..." she decreased with a loved audience.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stand is a business that will be said that a new generation of plates lovers would have inspired: Urban Outfitters.
While I looked like to have Jeans Hotpants, I watched a group of young teenagers who group themselves in a moment on Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter to buy a Crosley plate player.
On the left, there is a trepper house, a full wall of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac plates: a mixing of temporary music and classic sicks, the essential plates for a medium collection.
No one looks at it - perhaps because they are just decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "platten art".
But in view of the fact that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers can send to the deep Sohos for more, there is nothing to shut up.
It is not surprising that a group of people who have more time and money than others is also those who are mostly experiencing for luxus events such as plates.
Even if my research shows that the results of YouGov are voted, they will not take into account, at least in platte business in Soho, the large number of women's collectors and platform guests that exist in reality, platform business and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or offices.
They're not safe with the bombs by plates in the Berwick Street and the footles by plates, while they communicate to the overwhelming view of an unclean, 30-year false moderator that calls no men who have a medium-year-old age over the shoes.
The Gr√∂nlandhai is the most long-living workshop - video report
Scientists say that the Gr√∂nlandhai has the most longest living level of all the workshops on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigated the Haie, says that the record was with a woman who was out of that it was between 272 and 512 years old and five feet long.
French Court refusal offers for absorption of businesses in the Dschungel refugee stock
A French court rejected a offer of the authorities in Calais, twenty-third of provisorical business and restaurants in the dschungel of Calais, in the county of thousands of refugees.
In a court negotiation this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be able to spend 72 provisional businesses in which persons in the loan, from cigarettes to energy drinks, to sell fresh services, or to sell tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or to sell for a few euros in provisor restaurants.
The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be disfellowshipped because they would be a parallel economy that would not be paid taxes and mount a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups shared the Court that businesses and restaurants are important, since the free food time offered by the State supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also found that provisor businesses and restaurants would often offer an accommodation and free food time for people.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the instruction of people employing the 72 provisor business, but found that the concerns of Calais's prefecture were absolutely "complete".
Judge Jean-Fran√ßois Molla said that food business, coffees and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people who "will live in extreme precautions".
He said that the areas of tranquility are offered between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that were threatened by the Niederlands was the Jungle Book Kids' caf√© of the Lager, which will be commonly employed and offer 200 feettimes on the day, English and French class, as well as a advice for the hundreds of protected, uncomplied minors in the labour.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to realize the kid's coffee.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closure was called "for these children a disaster whose last eight years are old".
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrant estimated on Friday that the number of lives in the dschungaler was increased to over 9.000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steadily increase of new congress during the summer.

Here the Enforcement Trailer comes
Germany's Raser must set up on the next generation of speedwater: In different federal countries, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new blitz devices will be tested to carry the timers specially effectively.
The future-effective enforcement trailer of the Vitronic company, for example, can be used on accidental points where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary blower to comply with speed limits.
However, a sustainable mobile construction may be too dangerous or emerging.
The enforcement trailer is atark: His battery holds five days in uninterrupted measuring, the data are encrypted through a modem.
The laser measuring technique can also be examined by all vehicles through several tracks at the same time.
Variable speed limits and passenger bans after time, driving and vehicle classs can also be monitored.
In higher state, the manufacturer may be moved with each car with an appendix.
In order to not simply shoot, he is deleted in the measuring industry, so that the roots in the shooting and otherwise disappeared foreign shoes.
Furthermore, an integrated alarm plant is to protect the blister before Vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to the information of Vitronic in various federal countries and is also used in a half-term.
In addition, foreign authorities slow with the new technology: Youth in France has run 100 pieces, after a order of 150 pieces in the past year.
Britain takes silver in the 7th Rugby, after Fiji Masterclass Gold holt
The impressive performance of the Great Britain at the 7th Rugby ended on Thursday at the end of the last garden in the form of Fijis, when they were struck in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deomor Stadium.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, seat set, spins, line loops and strong strength to win gold - their first Olympic medals every color.
The swimming place was shocked by the unexpected comfort price of silver medaille - the United Kingdom fourd on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, where they tried to smile New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear cutting of the boks, 7-5 in half-final on the same day, could return to them at the end.
But independence on that, Fiji would have struck a 15-man team in best form.
It could be a comfort for the GB - but it will probably not - that at least one British medaille will have a gold medaille for his hair: Fijis Chiefrainer Ben Ryan, the former Chief for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a hard way behind.
Eight years ago, she lost every game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
There's only one lost her.
This sleep is painful, but progress is surprising.
Fiji began wonderfully and left the GB's attacks out of pass.
It felt the captain Tom Mitchell and co., as you were going to walk in bus. The World Series winners went to the top of 5-0, as Osea Colinisau traveled in the edge.
With four minutes of play time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right edge that he turned.
12-0 and GB did not take the ball.
A heavy ball of Mitchell stopped reaching a third gate of man Leone Nakarawa, but Fiji has stopped.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a toilet down in the right edge and there was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the reappointment, and there was still a minute of play time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo was pressed by further weak tackling of the GB team and shooted up to the line to make a gate.
The conversion took a 29-0 to the pause.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still learns.
That's too.
GB carried out basic changes to half-time and closed the Fijian laugh for all four minutes, which was good for the first half-time, until Josua Tuisova was through a brilliant inter-play of Fiji.
Dan Norton started a trial for GB, made a touchdown in the left edge for a 36-7, but the game was lost for a long time for the South Sea-Oceans whose fans were saved, shooted and danced on the tribune.
It was not hard to admire the player's approach Fijis.
Mata Viliames put the i-connexion with another attempt in the last seconds.
The Pilf shocked the Fijis and GB was shocked in the races.
Before the day, Fiji Japan had seen in half-fill in Japan with 20-5, and South Africa drove to a nice half-final mach from the red - British change of the difference.
Kyle Brown took the boks in the first half, but Dan Norton passed the line with a impressive footwork and reached a door among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aid team, saved the win - and thus the silver medaille.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the trainer cancer to ruder seage
No emotiary gold will be given than in these games and it wants to call something.
From the first to the last, 220 hard heats in the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional significance in their golden moment at the Stacio da Lagoa.
Even if there were only the pains that were on the ruder, there were three voices in the ship. The echo of Trainer Robin Williams was first presented as they were to the second Olympiagold in the second without tax race, the first women in the history of the British sports, who took such a measuring table.
Their dominance was absolutely, whereas 39th of its unclean use, which is also unlikely.
What we're seeing is two brilliant athletes that spend over the surface with the elegance of skins, which does not reflect the type of triumphis on skins.
Through every gold in the routine, a bathroom of wanting helpers contribute to the incredible progress that makes the difference and it was no more helpful than the trainer who didn't know if he would ever survive this day than he had been diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said he was a risk.
I had a bleeding cancer, operating and doing it.
If you don't do it, he'll be wiped out everywhere.
It would have been a very bad situation.
It changes the view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was happy that he had been treating the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could start what the interruption had been at the minimum if it was under such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better back soon.
It was an encouraging.
I was in the hospital and I was on the station about 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
So it's starting.
The routine is already a challenge, but it makes it even greater.
In the inmediate victory of the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who had a nervous morning, passed something more than anything else and thus tried to handle his own fears.
Stanning, who was the primary man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an Afghanistan, said, "I was this week a emotional rake. This may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It's just repeating how much I mean how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have been, so we're going to thank him, and he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't want a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost rent in the past five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which they could not keep their enemy.
Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to join, Stanning and Glover were too much in reserve.
We were very captured at the moment.
Helen called "Keep in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to let us smile.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to make something good.
We wanted no firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, leave and win the rain, which we did.
The couple will take a time for one year before it takes decisions on his future.
Glover has to appear on a wedding week next, his own with the TV advisor Steve Backshell.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that it was my last time.
That would mean too many pressures.
It was about six months in London to understand that I was a Olympiagester.
It was so new for me and I was so painful.
There's about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years old for clarity
The business leader of the Waterweck Group "Veitenstein Group", Ruppert G√∂ller, is in the peace.
The association is "simagely" to be used.
A small frequencies drinking water association as an example for the large water producers.
Thus it was called in the original ton in a contribution to the Bayerian round fridge.
A few months later, the water forum of the Government of Africans accepted the Joint Association.
The work of the Veterinary Steel Group said "bayer-wide as an example".
All of this is Rupert G√∂ller, who was 31 years in the final partnership, 28 years as a business leader.
Now, when he was 65 years old, he was adopted in peace.
The drinking water association of the veterinary stone group with seats in cottendorf, the Common Breadbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubits of water each year and provides 32 places and weilers with approximately 5500 inhabitants.
Memberships are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city Baunach.
For other cities and communities there are water delivery contracts.
The current President, Breitbruns Citizens-Minister Gertrud B√ºhl (FW), recalled that Rupert G√∂ller 1985 was set as water guard and was already appointed to the Head of the Goal Association in 1988.
The Chairman said: "Is tasks have been very multifaced, and they have been engaged in water construction and maintenance work on offices and organizations, budget planning, calculation of expenditure and contributions until weekends of emergency", said the Chairman.
As an excellent event, she called the inclusion and involvement of the new burns (1994), basic purchases in the field of the new burns (1998) and the deterioration of farmers, the sanction of the high-reservers (1999), the renewing of a central computer-building (2004) and the part of water guidelines.
It hasn't given a smooth stand and has always been re-newed because water is the most important food of water and drinking water.
In her Laudatia, she loving Gods faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He used himself with a lot of heartblue for his waterweck association and had regularly lived the Water Track Association as it would be his own company.
However, just a few weeks ago, he could present the concept of the veterinary stone group on the nitrate reducing before the water forum of the district of underground diseases.
For this, he has received a lot of recognition and loving.
Rupert G√∂ller, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water expectation and he's been a faithful button.
We were together a shooting team.
In his view, he called the burn construction and restructuring of the Association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use of this was, however, the raw brown on the high conservator at Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here, at least 17 degrees, the whole night will be worked in order to enable the places to be supplied with water.
The supply of new bruns has only been able to keep up once because you were filled with the high conservator of Pett City.
The business management of the drinking water association was transferred to Daniel Stormer from Lauter, which joined the follow-up of Rupert G√∂ller.
The Sopranist Anna Netrebko is open to the autumnism of her son, Tiago, and turns to other parents concerned: "You must have the courage to speak about it."
"The medicine has made great progress", said the 44-year-old age of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was recognised with her son, she believed she should die.
However, the eight-year-old Tiago has been good in advance and now teaches privacy in New York where it gives the best therapy.
"To give an example: if I ask him what returns two years when I sang to the mail country Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the most happy man on earth.
Tiago is connected with the basebarite Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relations in Bargtenesses - Man shoots on life threaten
A 35-year-old man shooting on Friday at 10.45 p.m. in a multi-familiar house in Bargteitye (Kreis Stormarn) on his partnership and died.
"The man has called himself with us and stated to shoot his life threat," said a police speaker.
The murder is on the fleet, after him is publicly posted.
It's a swimming distance, because Sven S. could be in the car.

Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The German steel industry and crisis enhanced and energetic intensity remains decreased by additional costs in millions.
Financial loads that threaten the sector from the ecostrom promotion are from the table.
It remained in the exemption of renewable energy environment in the stocks of assigned ownership production in the German steel industry, said the Federal Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the Western General Journal (WAZ, free-day expenditure).
"I'm really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years."
The European Commission had first planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the hochof to generate electricity for their own consumption.
The steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year in accordance with the details of the German Branch Association.
Gabriel said the WAZ is now a primary association with the Commission of the EU in discussion with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
First, when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEC environment of 20% should be increased.
But this will not be raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on the Provision of Electricity.
This is widely defined by the status of the current regulation.
Special importance has the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry.
"In terms of our 'Star is the future' campaign, this is the first step."
"We have to follow."
"As in the reform of emission rights, the climate and employment goals are to be decreased", explained IG Metall Chief J√∂rg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel sector in Europe has been under supercapacity and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
In the past year, the situation continued when the world's largest producer country of China faced the weakening home demand of a massive steel on the world market.
European manufacturer will propose Chinese steel convergences.
During this spring, the situation has been disappointed.
For a demonstrated import duties on import steel effects, the economic perspectives in China have been achieved.
It is unexpected how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German Branchen Primus Thyssen Group remained careful on Thyssen Group on Thursday.
Lastly, the prices would have been stable again.
The sector reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssengroup did not finally want to exclude the closure of individual works.
In the German steel industry, about 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel manufacturers are carefully concerned, despite increased prices and increased orders.
They produced with 3.4 million tons well six percent less raw steel than in the past month, as the economic association shared the steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced has now been back to the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, the production is two percent below the previous year value.
In the next months, the association shall be calculated by a improved term of order with an increased expenditure.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singen keep senior good
The song has joined Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl was in the school, she taught the fach music at the school office, and today the 78-year-old girls in a senior chor.
"Skins move me - emotional and physically," she describes.
After a test, she feels equivalent, joyful and totally more living, she says.
Besides her health and spirit, she does something good.
Because Singen is just a great hobby for seniors, says Herhard Hackler from the German senior link.
The majority of seniors sing in the chor and share the joy of the music, describes Hackler.
The regular collection of seniors can link and attach social contacts.
Because often solve social and family structures in age, a chor is an ideal opportunity to carry out time with others.
This experience also has made Ursel Kipp in their chor: "It is a very special form of meeting."
Singen can be positively encouraging, I mean Hackler.
Because the senior trains a deep and controlled breath.
Whoever regularly requests his lungs is not so fast every day from the bridge.
Even if it's about getting the voice skin in age, songs are a optimal hobby.
A very special effect on older people often has to be sing, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Community of Senior Organizations.
In the old generations, the common song had much higher places, it belonged to every day, both in the school and in the free time.
Lenz often observes that the songs or hearing of songs in older people are cutting many memorys, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time.
With song texts and especially melodies, the same demended persons have a long-term retreat event.
The head is also requested for special performance in the song, says Lenz.
Sit to concentrate at the same time on your own voice and on a prescribed rhythm and to adapt to the other songs - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Almost older people who live alone are so that they are not only focused on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that you're receiving through the song in the chor, means Hackler.
An excited public is a great loving.
The feeling of self-value also increases through the song in the chor.
If I work for something, I'll be better and wake out of me - this experience strengthens.
Good reason to start with the song, there is enough.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby shouldn't wear - even if he means to have a little talent, Lenz.
You don't sing alone - 50 sing people, who's listening to it when a voice goes up?
In search for the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
Once someone from the famous circle in a senior, you can simply connect.
Many cities also offer overviews about the Cuts in the area.
Whoever wants to sing in a church chor can directly go to the congregation or to the chief chief.
Many artists are also found on the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet may ask the family, friends or neighbors for help at Internet search.
Whoever has lust to sing should unless a chor, he's sweet Hackler.
Sing the soul does good and has something free - it applies to every age.
Kats react sensible than cats on the cry of the youth
Biologists have investigated in Hannover what effect has the call of Katzenbays on adult animals.
At their surprising, the meau did not get the male cold - however, they had always been equivalent to women.
Women's cats can recognise the degree of Katzenbays in the mile of the small.
They respond to ten percent more faster to the laundry of kitchens that are in great emergence, such as scientists from the animal health school and the medical high school Hannover (MHH).
Caters also respond to the call of kitchens - however, it is always the same.
"Openly, the acoustical differences between the meau of less and strong jewels for men aren't true or not", said the Biological Wiebke Konerding by MHH.
She is a study statistic, published on Friday in the BMC Evolutionary Biology Fach Magazine.
In an previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and sound height of the chatchen sword is different with the urgency of their assistance.
Overall, nine adult cards and eight kitchens were observed from the MHH's animal maintenance.
You were predicted for a call of little people taken from the box for three minutes and separated from mother and sisters.
On the other hand, they were faced with crystals of stronger cuts that were further higher.
The researchers keep their results despite the low-scale tests.
"All women, even those who have not yet had their own investigation, respond to the cry," Konerding said.
They turned back to the sound speaker when this call of the very sweet kitchen.
This is possible to be born or developed with sex.
"It was a surprise that the men have reacted", the biologists said.
In the past, scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men on baby-care.
In addition, some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to sweetlings, even if they were mothers or not, reported the biological Marina Scheumann.
Podolski greefed with "Gaala" to Supercup
Hakan S√ºk√ºr is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a arrest order was taken against the only football star Hakan S√ºk√ºr.
He is intended to be a member of a terrorist group.
The first time after the swimming pocket, in Turkey again is a important football game.
Before the dual of the rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul on the supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly called "Business as usual".
Until the derogation in July, the Government noted that the daily day of normal citizens should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those suspected to listen to the movement of the preaching worker Fethullah G√ºlen, which is responsible for the slaughter.
This will not be done before the football.
Under the previous Starkicker Hakan S√ºk√ºr, the State Agency ordered a prison order.
This will be proposed to be a member of a terrorist group in the middle of the United States.
It is urgent to be an ambassador of the preaching worker Fethullah who is responsible by the President of the State, Recep Tayip Erdogan, for the slaughter.
Although the exemption conditions for the first 90 days are passed until October, it actually has no effect on the lives of most of the Turkeys.
"Democracy Watchs" on public places in the whole country has declared Erdogan on midnight.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into adherents and enemies of Erdogan.
Special fans of the workshop Besakta are not traditionally among the friends of the President.
What the largest of the Turkishs, but in view of dramatic experiences in the history, is the strict rejection of military pounds.
There are even the fans - it is unlike if their hearts are shocked for Galatasaray or Besikta.
In the pokal seiger "Gaala" it will be particularly at Lukas Podolski.
His sportive value at the end of the season was evidenced: With 17 doors and nine models in all competitions, the 31-year-olds ended his first game period as the topscorer of its agreement.
In the end of the game against Fenerbahce, he reached the 1:0 sequence.
The "Fanatic" newspaper tried him: "He was the best on the place."
He closed the season in an excellent way and secured his manity the pokal.
Thanks to "Poldi" the swimming season for the register's register found a deceitful end.
The "League" in the Championship of League also spoiled early in Europe League.
In the super Lig, it was only six.
The season wasn't good.
The pokal was the only opportunity to win something.
"It's what we did, and that's the most important," said Podolski.
For Master Beektas, the game year is better.
In particular, thanks Mario Gomez, who put the base to the 14th Title with 26 seasons as super-Lig king.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope to return to the 31-year-old.
In this way, the Gomez, which was noted in the AC Florence Treaty and which was noted only after the slaughter, was not returning to the political situation in the country after his EM vacation.
"When Mario wants to come to us, he must only say it," said the "Kicker" club chief Fikret Orman.
However, this should be ready to reject around a third of its $7.5 million annual year year old rated around, Orman clearly stated: "We can't pay his content in Florence".
Nevertheless, these athletes still have medaillen cancers at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already cut two times because of Dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa may not start in Rio.
Other transferred light-letic sinners can just laugh about it - they fight in Rio through medailles.
The Doping theme determines as before the slaughter lines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian maimer Julija Jephimowa, who had sent its start right shortly before the games, was evacuated and exploded when they started 100 meters of breast.
It was a scourrier scenario: with a laughed laugh she was still stolen in the hall and had tried with her resignation.
When he found that she wouldn't get gold, the public took out into a jubel tower.
But there are still many other sports, although Doping past in the Olympic games in Rio.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-style/USA): The 34-year-old boy belongs to the most surrounded figures in the lightathletic.
He was cut two times because of Doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his bank, the Olympicians of 2004 and the ex- World Meister is even more fast than before, it is 100 m in 9,80 seconds the number one of the world and applys to the largest challenges of Usein Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100,4x100-m-Jamaika): The second Olympiasiher and seven times the World Master of 2010 had to rest a six-month sphere after she was declared that the pain of Oxycodon was taken.
After an operation, she had strong dentist pain, the 29-year-old boys defended.
Sandra Perkovic (discuss/Croatian): 2011, the Olympiasiher of 2012, World Master of 2013 and European Master of 2010 to 2016 has been tested positively on the prohibited stemulans midst of Methyllexanamin.

In this year the 30-year is over 200 and 400 meters of the fastest man in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Whiterussland): Unlike athletes have been so many medailles not only known.

Bombenterror in Thailand - Austrian blessed - several dead
The Austrian message in Thailand was in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Foreign Minister, Thomas Sch√∂rtll, Friday.
They have suffered skin wounds and were treated in the hospital, but they've already been able to leave this again.
Your home trip planned her for the beginning of September.
Whether other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the south towns of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian state citizens.
In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in permanent contact with the local authorities, so slowly.
At about 200 kilometers south of the capital of Bangkok, Hua Hin, first on Thursday, were explosed in two bombs.
According to the police, a Thai country was killed and some 20 people were injured, including Austrians, three Germans, three Netherlands and three Italians.
Then, on Friday, two springs were up again, and the authorities were killed another person.
The bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in early.
In the detonation near the Badestrade Patong, popular with holidays, a taxi driver was damaged after police instructions.
In Surat Thani, the south coast of the country explosed another bomb that killed a city officer.
The spectrum has been in the air, according to the authorities, in a flower beet before the coastal police reverse.
Finally, detonations were requested in Phang Nga and changing on the south-west coast and in Chumphon at the southern coast.
You go from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, called it.
"The bomb captain takes the same document,‚Äù said the Armee General Danai Crimethavee freeday fee before journalists.
"We're going out that it's a coordinated attack."
It's too early to express potential reasons - however, it is likely to be handled about the acts of muslim rebels.
The Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern that is typical for the bombs of muslim separators in the south of the country.
However, the Thai police declared that the attacks were not related to Islamic resurrection or international terrorism.
"This is only local Sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces", said one speaker in Bangkok.
Moreover, the bombs of enemy of the dominant military junction were put.
In the past days, the authorities had received a secret indication on pre-reaching cases in the south of the country - however, they had not been informed about the exact time and places.
It's still unexpected what group behind the appeals.
The police advised its officials in the whole country to strengthen the security around the important government buildings and aircrafts, train heights, tourist attractions, restaurants and awards.
In Thailand there are still smaller bombs, but they are not usually against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by the king of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadei.
Following the current explosions of bombs, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends that the Taylands' Security Authority guide the instructions of its homepage.
High security risk (security level 3) learned for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhcla and Preah Vihear and Environment.
After interferences between the security forces and the Muslim Population Camps, it is not necessary to travel in these provinces.
Increased security risk (security stage 2) was given to the rest of the country.
The requests held on Thursday and Friday few days after an overwhelming referendum on a Constitution developed by the Militaryjunta.
This is also the great impact of the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chef and Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to shoot Chao, while the country moves towards stability, improved economic situation and tourism.
The military runta, who had taken the power after a stage of blue distress 2014, was self-employed to have brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
Nevertheless, the military has not been able to obtain the resistance of Muslim rebels since years in the outer south of the country.
In the conflict, more than 6500 people were killed.
Nearly one year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in a attack to a popular Hindu grin - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the worst attack of the newest history of the country.
The right "identifiant movement" is in the visa of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After a number of country officers, the Constitutional Protectors also observed the group.
"We see the 'identified movement' points for efforts against the free democratic rule", said the Constitution Chief Hans-Georg Maachten of the German Presse Agency in Berlin.
In this way, migrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are extremistly diffused.
This is why we also look at the movement.
The "identific movement" is a grouping with French roots, which is also active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "Multiculti-Wahn", "uncontrolled massage" and the "Perd of his own identity by transmission".
Constitution protectioners in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Sachsen and Th√ºringen - already observe the "identified".
He said that his authority had closely agreed with the officials of the decision.
"Creates like the 'identified movement' try to take their target group where it is", said the Constitutional Protection Chief.
Generally, extremists try to speak to them with youth right language, often with poppier music.
The Islamics also killed the law extremists.
This isn't a good advertising for your own matter.
The Propaganda is to address the people emotionally.
Young people are in a special sense.
That's dangerous.
Lastly, it had reports from several federal countries on "identified" contacts on AfD policyers.
He said he didn't have any knowledge of it.
Constitutional protection contacts are only relevant from a certain point.
It comes to the fact that each party - in this case, the ADD - changes their goal and becomes so extremist.
It is therefore indicative that such taxing persons have an impact on the parties.
This is not recognisable.
In view of the clear increase in legal motive crimes and attacks against asylum demanders and refugees, Maasser said that he would not speak in this regard yet from the new right terrorism.
But we have found in the past years that it can give legal terrorist structures.
There was the 'Old School Society' group or the Freetaler Group.
It may be said that there are further legal terrorist groups or small groups that are planned against asylum demanders, refugee homes or attacks from other legal extreme motivations.
However, a German or European control of law terrorism is not recognisable.
The existing groups were at the regional level or in social networks.
It was worried that many oppositions were on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scenes.
That's the worried thing.
Many of the defenders in the case of attacks on asylums have not been known as criminal, politically motivated criminals or actors of the right scenes.
"That's why many persons have started crimes that had nothing before with legal extremists, which may have been politically separated or, for example, chosen CDU, SPD or links, which, however, were radicalized by legal extremist stimulation machines."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte will be on the Internet path
Not always determine the Olympics or World Records the slaughter lines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous event of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the lightly overwhelming swimming swimming from Ethiopia was so late that he was not to see in the TV images.
He simply disappeared - unlike the extent was chosen.
The social networks have then been the viral internet stream.
In fact, the 24-year-old age ends with a distance of 48 seconds and engaged the 59th place of 59 starters.
However, it was not just his sporting figure that moved to the attention of the international media.
Why, however, the 24-year-olds participate in the Olympic games?
The Ethiopians received a special starting law from the international Swing Association.
This is distributed to make more known nitrogens in sub-represented countries.
Since the majority of the sports in Ethiopia runs, Habte just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte makes himself ready for the great journey.
Quickly the first piece names made the round.
Some media called it "robel of the Wal".
The English boulevardblatt "The Sun" was sweet over him.
His time, he was just a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter free style, did not play a role.
Compares with "Eric the Eel" were also taken.
At the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney, Eric Moussambani was careful for mediaal attention.
Indefinitely, the swimming swimming from Equatorial-Guinea had to occur in a time of over 100 meters of freestyle alone.
Frenetic was then shocked Moussambani.
At that time, only eight months ago, the 22-year-old teenage learned to smile Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the coast.

Trump does not look close to the threatening election situation.
The Republican Presidency candidate Donald Trump speaks on a election campaign meeting in Florida.
If it's no choice to the US Chairman, Donald Trump has already a alternative.
Then he's walking in the holidays.
If Donald Trump loses the US Presidency election in November, it would be relatively equivalent to him: "Over the last time I'm going to cut it, or I have a very beautiful, long holiday," the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the US French advisor CNBC.
If it is not rich for him at the end of the political correction, it's okay, Trump.
So he called the US Chairman Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democratics, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic terrorism State (IS).
In the outside of his party, it was still more resistance.
Post increases in the trade with electronic transporters
Electronic vehicles of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the danger is obviously large.
The post plants to sell your electric vehicle StreetScooter also.
In Korze, the concert wants to start trade with the transporter.
The post wants to offer its electronic transporters from the next year also on the free market.
"We want to increase in the sale to thirds," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether they should also sell to other operations of their own developed StreetScooters, with the letters and packs.
Post-president J√ºrgen Gerdes had said that it was always again asked, about handworkers.
According to the information of the News Machine "The Spiegel" the Bonner Concern will involve the mass production of the vehicles in rounds.
In the post-fabrication plane, the company will build up from up to 10,000 cars per year and shock.
Gerdes had announced that the concerts wanted to increase its fleet of electric vehicles clearly and spend a complete conversion of long terms to the environmental friendship vehicles.
"We're going to make a very robust step direction 2020," he said end July.
I can imagine that we're turning the complete fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on German streets since 2014.
GfK guidelines are decreased after detrimental business payments
The GfK Consumer Research company slaughtered his chief Matthias Hartmann.
The retreats were suddenly, but not very surprised.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK acknowledged that the stage of the head of the chief Matthias Hartmann will be more insecure, as long as it was promised.
Turbulences at the point of the N√ºrnberger market research company GfK: After re-interrupting business numbers and the decline of enterprise management, the world number five of the sectors will be held before a personal re-accession.
GfK's chief wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The President of the GfK Advisory Council, Arno Mahlert, has already been separated by the Supervisory Board on 12 September.
The leadership of the government was already over to 1 September the previous leader Gerhard Hausruckinger, who shared the company.
He must officially take the function of a "president speaker" until a follower for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the delay, the company called "divergent opinions" for long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to call a company speaker on Friday.
Who will lead to the market research company to be still unexpected.
On Friday, the restructuring of the restructuring covered by the shareholders had recently been increased.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK split since 2011.
"The fruits of restructuring are still not seeing after five years," said it.
In view of the last bad GfK business payments, each shareholder will eventually be disappointed.
"If that would be the case in BMW, it would also do the timets," said it.
The company had not been able to stop his loss in the second quarter of 2016 after returns.
With 361,2 million euros, the expenditure was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable previous centre.
With regard to the first half year, the overall rate of EUR 721.2 million was 3,4 per cent.
The profits in the second quarter have, in particular, regarding the low value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
Consumer Experience, which was necessary for 139 million euros, decreased a loss of EUR 148.2 million under the strike.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had built a concert win of 19.7 million.
Accidentes - Bus swimming in slaughter: 8 Bathrooms
On a travel bus accident with 43 seniors as passengers, on Thursday, 8 people are injured on Thursday in Krummhorns (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the infringements suffered seriously, the police shared.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to exempte its information as a resulting laster that had been carried out on the train.
The bus came right away from the street and shooted in a snake, as a speaker of the Aurich/Whitmund police reported.
"On the basis of the bus situation, people couldn't leave the bus autonomy," she said.
The fires freed the insects.
Six saving vehicles and a notar vehicle came to an accident on the country 2.
The latest travelers were returned from a line bus to the crowd of the crowd of Pewsu.
They should wait at a replacement bus of the travel company.
The investigators requested the passenger and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The expenditure per cubikmeter waste includes from 1 October 2016 for the area of the New Dorf/Reuth/Welchenkahl 3,44 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3,36 euros (before 2,26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (before 2,18 euros).
The installation in Azendorf will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvements are needed.
After an overall calculation, the water price in Azendorf will then be 4,37 euros per cubicmeter.
As Master Bernd Stein Houses (CSU) reported, the Country Council of Kulbach has been determined that undertaking for these wastewater plants will be undertaken.
The Casendorf market is required due to legal basiss to operate the installations costly.
From 1 October 2016 the citizens and the shopping and industrial firms of Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg are to be able to enter the currency shopping hotel.
The rate increases are between 48 and 67 per cent.
As the manager Herbert Schmidt showed to the body, it was necessary to recalculate the expenditure of the costs for the market communities.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over-related subdetections were compared from the previous calculation period.
The severe expenditure increases founded that there were relatively small plants for all three wastewater plants with a very low water accident, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubitmeters per year.
Thus, due to the low distribution base, for example, the applications for necessary repairs of several thousands of euros would be seriously affected.
In addition, it is easy to relax in all three plants.
Furthermore, all three plants have not recently affected sanctional and reparatory applications in their age.
The facilities in Azendorf were nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth, and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the Azendorf installation, the mechanical switching plant was to be discovered because of a damage.
In the pumpwork of Welhenkol, the twenty-year-old aid plants had to be removed by reason and, nearly 20 years later, Lopp had to operate the first slope, swimming the slope and building additional swimming opportunities to keep the water slippers in a future manner.
Schmidt: "This extraordinary applications came to the continued care and maintenance costs to be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The equivalent applies to electricity costs which are still significantly below the current level at the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steel households clearly made that in the low-water fall in the three installations the applications for the exploitation and maintenance were "complete".
In addition to the Smidt, the market community of large maintenance costs remained in the last 20 years.
The situation for the plants concerned will continue to remain precarious to the end of stone houses, so that the area of the Water Training Association Friesen observer can not be extended to these installations because it is deficienciated institutions.
Bulgaria has the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (af June 2012) and the first over 0 since October last year, as a positive 0.2%.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0,8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (Juli 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 -0.2%.

The prices fall in clothing and shoes (2.2%); mobile, budgetary devices and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
The prices remained as in the month before at alcoholic drinks and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuel; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "animal effect" criticizes as Asian carriage
Snapchat says that this filter is animized, but some observers say it is unsecual to races.
With its filter tool, Snaapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identities in a way that is already limited to absurde.
You can turn into ananas, a dog or a figure that could be sweet from a roy lightenstone.
The filters are uncompressed, properties rotating tools that generate semi-building semi-building for more than 30 million per day.
All failures have been achieved to publicity.
Snapchat filters have taken their criticism in the past, in which they were accused of propagering the App Blackface or white skin as beautiful side.
When this week some users predicted a filter that gave them slippers, false teeth and shocking angles, some critics called a racist carriage of Asians - "Gelb face".
They asked whether these repeated contrasts showed a greater problem that the company has diversity.
The news and the reception were widely distributed at midnight, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat reported that it had disabled the feature.
The company asked for apologizing: The filter was a hommage of anime charakter and not as a carriage of Asians.
But foreigners who have experienced the racism, the filter reminded the filters of harming clergy.
Others decided the anime comparison.
In an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely distributed over the photos that the filter was "injured and pleasant".
She added that "that is difficult to argue with the opposition of a very opposite Asian carriage and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not careful, but that the face of the skin was taken into an appreciative extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that overcomes this cultural steel ratio.
The American culture seems to be engaged in an unfinished diversity and integration fight, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all keep in the hand.
And Snapchats, a great public of young people - who are different in race matters than their older players - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat filters creates a image that is political for a user, "that's much more difficult to remain unremarkable than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu decided to remove its Snapchat account to others as a product manager and engineer for media.
In an appendix for media and telephone interview, she said she believes that racial contrasts reflect the lack of diversity in setting practices in Snaapchat.
Zhu criticized the white, only men's leadership and ended their post with a Hashday: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Only they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their skin, so they can take such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they are safe or like to say something."
Others share their views, a complaint that mostly unresponsed Snapchat.
The company does not publish numbers for the diversity of its involvement and gives up its status as private undertakings.
On Thursday, the Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but a speaker recently established a personnel responsible, which focused on sub-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu told her that she was left to close her Snapchat account and added, "I ask me if they need more users like us to say that this isn't O.K.."
Military ISIS Secret Service Information, establishes the Committee of the Congress
Military members of the United States Central Command changed public information to describe a optimistic image of the war against the Sog. Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the real conditions in place, reported an investigation committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, prepared by a Task Force of the Republic of the Republic of the Forces of the Force, the Secret Services Committee and the Committee of the Peacebudget, reports of great inadequacy under the Central Commanding Secret Service Analysts, which reported how their assessments were made on the American efforts in combating the Islamic State.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Lakes.
"Information services, which were typically transferred by higher Centcom Commanders, regularly marked a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the real situations before place and were more positive than analysis of other news services", reported a newspaper article.
"What has happened at Centcom, it is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analysis are presented by our political leaders," says Ken Calvert, the Republican member of the Representative House.
The leadership errors in the Centcom are available to the best part of the organization.
The tenth report shows detailed continuous problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government splits have given Obama instructions to change the reports, analysts showed how to describe a optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, including known as ISIS or ISIL.
"After the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Communications, opinions and comments were significantly positive than it corresponds to the facts."
For instance, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military relocation of Moscou could be started in April or May 2015.
Mossula, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"In the months of investigation, it's so clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republic of Kansas, in an opinion.
From the midst of 2014 to the midst of 2015, the headings of the Central Command changed the public service reports to support the risk by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans urged Task Force to live after they were resigned that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday is still completed by more detailed expertise during the investigations.
Furthermore, the Centcom reports are investigated by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own recognition that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republic of Task Force.
"In the 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the development of service assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services", reported the highest democracy in the Committee, member of the Representative of the House of Adam B. ship, in an opinion.
This process, as Mr. ship, "delayed the publication of public services reports", damaged the moral under analysts and "gab overly few spaces for dismissing opinions".
But Mr. ship and the democrats gave no indication to have found a white house in the Centcom Analysts about a "determined political opinion".
The provisional results of the outcome of the Congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
In August last, the New York Times reported the investigations by the Pentagon Inspector General, which were included after complaints of Centcom Analysts.
Mr. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a speaker of the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the Conference while the investigation of the general Inspector is still in the gate.
But he also acknowledged that "experts sometimes have different opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the defence Ministry welcome a controversial debate on these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under the United States leadership in Iraq and Syria (of an observance which will be made in this respect by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
The accused of the past year, however, took the question of how President Obama can go to the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism on secret information about the Islamic State reminds the strictness of more than ten years ago, as a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, was a copy of how the former government under George W. Bush made the recommendations of many analysts only a small counterparty instrument in Iraq, and a little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr Hooker also played a key role in opposing the current report on the Islamic State.
In the past year, Mr. Hooker noted that the Government's statements against the coffee raffineries held by the Islamic state had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorism group, as these provisual coffees had been employed in order to sell oil on the black market.
However, this recognition was not published, reported the Times in September.
Centcoms former command chair, Gene Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislatives because of its extremely positive assessment of the war at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went in the rest of April and was replaced by Gene Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States wins fourth match in the field of women, a showdown with Britain is before
One day after she shocked three towers during a 6-1 wine over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two towers for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five Towers in two games should actually be a thoughtful performance, but Bam (27) said they could not remember what they were ever doing.
"I don't know." She said.
I don't listen to those who keep their door in the memory.
However, they know that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic Competition fight and are in their group with the Britishs on the first place that continues to settle against Japan after their 2-0 win.
Britain and the United States will meet each other on Saturday on the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the fourth-final, the game will decide which both of their group of six teams will reach the first and second place.
The first placed will go from the strong hole countries a little longer from the way to lead to the other group.
As always the game can go on Saturday, the Americans have solved a surprising mixture through their success history, four years after they landed at the last 12 places in London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She was in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and the first time in three years, she had a hockey shock in hands (other two old sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years of age, she became a national player in the United States, the most recently in the history of the team.
She passed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the Framework.
Then the year 2012, in which she and her team worked.
The following year, Craig Parnham, a English country, trainer of the National Team, began to apply the things to better.
"An cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the jobs in London that we had now.
We've been able to get the ruder completely.
On Thursday Bam opened the Torrent in the first half of the game with a back-up from the native area.
Although it was without winning in the tournament, but the team showed a surprising jacket and maintained the play stand of 1-0 to the third fourth, until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flanking ball over the left flanke, then moved to the middle and led the ball into the gate to make a 2-0 guide to the Americans.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last neighbor.
The Shutout was the first of the whole tourner for the United States, Jackie Briggs, who had to get a door in each of the previous games.
She's got a loop.
Like Bam.
"We're in a good position," said Parnham, but how good it's going to depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the Olympic Games, the center of the Trampolin
Whereever you are, how late it is, are the Olympic games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel a constant and uncertainty, a rather stage between competition and trials.
It's like the olympic fack itself a broken stab that is available from arms protection to the skin to the tourner to the triathlete.
You can't enable the TV to read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the waiting shoes in the coffeeshop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the conflict between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's still a Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who was the first time at the Olympic games and a woman's warm with sweet, could have been among these known names that were sent to the first time, built by sponsors and well-being TV if he was a swimming, turner or even swimming.
But Dooley, 28, from the Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympic Trampolin tours.
The Olympic flag does not look at any event.
Besides the center, partly in the shadow, the sports that are not generally recognized: air pitoles, bomb shots, bathrooms, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the shooting and we're gonna be able to rule it for a long time.
But if I do awarely arguments for my own love, then let me draw the attention to the discred shape of the trampolin.
Although the trampolin spring has been an olympic event since 2000, as it was in Sydney, it was so spoiled as the last 16 years that many of the ones I asked had not knew that it was an olympic sport.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. Athletes sent to the competition fight, there has never been a medaille in the trampolin springs and has got an athlete that has done it until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians aim to share the prices for men and Chinese and Canadians to share the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLenan from Canada this year will defend their gold medals from London.
The trampolin spring has a certain foreign charm, partly because it looks more suitable for the unexpected ears for a clown school than that for the Olympic games.
In this place I should admit that I'm not an expert, but just a connected discovery.
It has a humoristic potential - the cartonal quotes never to end its appreciation - but also the thanks for the tourn and smoking, the two sports, which join it in the most important.
The word "Trampolin" is from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means so much as "Sprungbrett".
Encouraging victories switch on a giant trampolin, shooting nearly 30 feet in the air and have to have a number of movements (thriving, heating and salts) before they are on the feet countries.
They will be evaluated according to the official Olympia programme following implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
Twenty-third athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will be attracted to each other in Rio.
The most common olympic vector is just out.
Medaillers must continue to gold in their strikes, faster, up and up, sometimes to go, sometimes to go back, to top and down on the game place.
They are not only the target lines or the starting changes, but also a higher goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympia Record.
The targeted goal is noble, wonderful, even fanatic - and it is enough to smell even a observer.
But it's also what I feel in the view of these games as something embarrassing.
The trampolin offers a breathpause.
The vector of the trampolin springer is above.
A previous movement is not the goal.
He or she calls, seemingly hard like a astronaut, goes up, then go down, then unfortunately go up.
It also dominates a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wheels in the television, just the dreamer, elegant relief of time and weakness.
It's so thrilling as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.
The qualification and final rounds of women will be held on Friday, at 1300 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00 p.m.
NBC will be extracted as part of a afternoon block on two days from 14.00.
Among the Olympia Manuy, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one who will probably be overlooked in general tumor.
If the consciousness increase can only be achieved by the acquisition and objection of men's acts - as the men's tourner said the Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley expects his ringing, a new fan community.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, a member of the United States
Violence Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators who call for political changes in Ethiopia are towards violent rebellion of the government.
The Witnesses say that zig protesters were killed during the assembly with the police in shock changes.
Is Ethiopians just to break together with it?
In the last ten years, it was one of the most stabil African countries, a solid partners of the West with a rapid growth economy.
But in the past months, protests against the government were assaulted by the country, and in many regions they were exhibited.
Last week, thousands of people were on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The Government's response was unbelievable, according to human rights organisations.
The Witnesses admitted that the police zig unarmed demonstrates shooted and killed them.
Simply in the round of the protests that are probably from the last or beginning of this year show how safe young people shocked with shocks, while they were forced to make a manner against a wall.
The Chief of the United Nations Human Rights Auditors now requires an inadequate investigation.
"It was always hard to keep this country and will be even more difficult to do so," said Rashid Dib, the project leader of the African Horn of the International Crisis Group, a group of research.
Ethiopia is estimated by Nigeria the most popular country of Africa and its stability by the West.
American military and secret services are closely working with the Ethiopians to combat terrorism over the region, especially in Somalia. Only few countries in Africa, if they are, are likely to receive such western assistance.
Ethiopian economy expanded in a considerable time.
His infrastructure has been drastly improved - there is a new rent in the capital of Addis Abeba.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was all other than an example of democracy - human rights organizations have continuously introduced the imprisonment by the Government - the opposition in the country has been limited, with the effective smuggling of dissidents.
Many were sent to exile or in prison, murdered, or driven in the deserts.
But that could change.
"If you push people, and they don't have any other options to protest, it says Seyoum Teshome, a dozen in Central Latiopians.
The whole youth protests.
A generation is protested.
There are numerous complaints that cover all of the terrestrial use to the decrease in respect of the power of the government coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the government parties and their associates received the last seat of the opposition and now controlled 100% of Parliament.
At the same time, the shocks increased from the border to Eritrea; a fight against this shocked, striking line requested hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics are afraid that separators such as Oromo's release front or the National Liberation Force, which have been more or less inflicted in the past years, could use the turbulences and can be weakened again.
Many factors explain why the feelings of the publicity after years of the skin is now explosed under the surface.
The first looks unfair: Smartphones.
In the last few years, very many ethiopians were able to communicate with social media, since more phones have been more frequent and improved the Internet services.
Even if the government shows access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are doing in regular distances, especially in protests, many people can still communicate through Internet processes that hide where they stop.
Many young ethiopians acknowledged their assembly to protests.
The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnics in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemy.
Since the Years, the Amharas, who came from Ethiopians overly higher Christian countries, prospered in the policy and economy, while they employed the oromos, many of whose muslims are and live in flags.
But that's just changed.
"We are there to coordinate under a scene," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests found in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which are around 6 percent of the population and dominated in the military, secret services, trade and policy.
The third reason for disgraceful ones is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, an ex-revoluntary leader, was until his death at a non-public illness in 2012, 17 years ago, the Prime Minister of Ethiopians.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about the edge.
Analysts say that he was specially distributed in it to observe early signs of inadequacy and to use special advisers to edit the enemy and make them unfortunately.
"The current regime lacks it to this fundamental ship," said Mr. Dio, a conflict-nalyticer.
The Ethiopians of the new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, were elected in relatively irrespective reasons to accept the position of Mr Meles.
On the other hand, Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray North Ethiopian region, comes from the south.
Analytics say he does not enjoy confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more blood loss.
The last time that Ethiopias experienced such a revolution was 2005 after thousands of elections protested, which seemed to have been prevented by the government and then stolen.
During the following races, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of disappointment was relatively fast.
Ethiopian leaders expressed their visional infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendarlership, as well as their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal inutility of the Ethiopian government.
And she takes a dangerous ethical form.
Last month Protestants in Gondar, an amharic city, took businesses from Tigray and Hass against Tigray becomes more common in social media.
Analytics say that the Protests bring the U.S. and other Western associations into a similar position.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for dronen flights over the nearby Somalia, even though recently she informed that she closed this base.
While westerns clearly want to support democracy, he does not want to join his partners in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Divid, "it's a very thin grain migration."
Donald Trump declared his statement Obama has founded ISIS or "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to destroy the latest controversies that turned out his campaign by acknowledging that his several times repeated statements, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were not seriously common.
This explanation made new questions on the communications capacity of the President of the Republicans, whether it could be clear and comprehensive with the American public.
It also brings its partners to protect him during a appropriate stage, in the own position to declare comments that he couldn't have shared.
After he had done the advertising at a election campaign at midday, Mr. Trump returned to Mr. Trump with regard to the holding on Thursday and began in interviews that he really was not aware of the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a early twitter on Friday, Mr. Trump said he's just sarcastic.
The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day in which Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said that the accustoration was completely serious.
When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump defeat the speech by reminding him that Mr. Obama ISIS wants to destroy, the Republican Presidency candidate wanted to know nothing about it.
The last stage of the criticism is on Mr Trump, while he tried to make the focus on his campaign because of the falling survey values in the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.
On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech.
Mr. Trump has already presented Sarkasmus to his defence.
In the end of July he had a strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's Emails, but he later explained, "I mean the sarcastic."
This method allows Mr Trump to move the language borders into the policy and then call back after need.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans, how they arrive, and then to "exply" according to how the response comes." Ruth Sherman, an expert of communication that observes the language of both candidates.
However, I think he is also clear enough to keep his words low enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of renewing the sound for the election of the presidency, Mr Trump has adopted a more accurate sound, since his values have continued.
A new survey of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the United States North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-an-rent in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his caused statements, he often accuses his critics to destroy his words or to understood his humor.
But while he strengthens the attention in the last few months of his presidency campaign, Mr Trumps' Scherze has put his loyal partners into the uncomfortable situation to him to stand, independently of how to cause his statements.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, an ex-Minister of New York and one of the most powerful preachers of Trumps, has made great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think he is legal, political comments", said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked to the rightness of Mr Trumps, whether Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an unknown, nearly unknown, small organization, he called her interfaces, completely wrong, and because he took the armies out of Iraq.
The majority of the Republic of Mainstream tried to argue that the government under Obama, Mrs Clinton, served as a Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to extend its expansion by emphasising the situation in the Middle East.
On Friday, before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump continued its attacks on the media and proposed to spend on each of his words and to be taken against him.
He increased the "weapon, pregnant" television experts that try to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some democratics urged Mr Trump's apologize just a further evidence that he was inadequate for the President.
Once the price of the market is broken, Caf√© returns to Greenpoint
Verb coffee was a sweet coffee in Williamsburg, where you could only pay a bar that had no Wi-Fi, but it served a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from Bedford Avenue Ladenefront were deleted.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced the Verb in the summer 2014, sell seals in the form of Cupcakes.
Inhabitantly it was the last loss of it in a generating city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is a change, but I can't still believe that CBGB is dead, out of the Chelsea Hotel and Verb is now a seventh business."
But if New York is changed, it's also a new resurrection.
A rebuilt Verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a miles north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are still some of the same employees and a similar slow atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-year employer of the old coffee, the owner and business leader of the new coffee.
He began to work with the Verb 2001 and remained there until the end.
When he offered a customer to prepare money for a new foreign place, he was urged to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, had much help.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels buyed the same Espressomaic model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try too.
He brought new additives.
On the food card, sandwiches are with spectacles and cakes and there are garnitures such as caps and swimming wheels.
There are natural shoes.
The coffee no longer serves bird, there are fried bees.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noted a steadfast electricity in old tribes.
"My old customers were also broken by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
On Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, was previously living in Williamsburg and visited regularly.
Even after she was taken to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After closing the verb, she gave the coffee a minute, she said.
"I was clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that pleased me," she said.
Now she drinks again coffee, even when she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of its usual iced coffees, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal is another long-year customer since the beginning of the Verb in 2003.
He went there before the work and, unfortunately, always ordered the same.
"I came fourteen after seven, every day, like a Swiss taste offer and they prepare my allthing bag with Butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and take new additives into the menu.
Today Rosenthal still receives his ordinary order, but sometimes he changes his allthing bag with speck, egg and kiss.
Rodriguez said he wasn't denied about the fact that the business was taking the old business room.
Indeed, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special sweet for verb with the cold coffee of the coffee.
"I think we will still take on her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional, Polandese Greenpoints also accepted the coffee.
A new customer has translated the food card to the Poland and Rodriguez said he intended to prepare them so that his new neighbors would be welcome.
The location also has further proposals.
A local saftlocal wants to fill and sell the cold coffee in the fleets.
There is a chance that the coffee expands to a nearby building.
For many customers, there is a new ban to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a stamp and said he was destroyed on the ground when the coffee closed.
When the new coffee opened, Whitt said that the participation of the local and the order felt a new coffee like a homekear.
"I had to ride it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich food time"
In March 1933, after his presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As Feinschmecker, President Roosevelt had a facility for raffined crimes of the Fifth Avenue, such as Pat√© de la grass, and Maryland watercraft suppe.
His menu at this day was something more discreet: pleased eggs in tomato sauce, cartoffelpuree and as dessert a plume pudding.
"It was a act of collinary solidarity with leading people," said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historicals.
Coes the last book "Chop Suey" was conducted by the Chinese kitchen in the United States while Zegelman reported in his book "97 Orchard" about living in a house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Your latest cooperation, "A reliable meal", which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of the American kitchen during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, slightless imbis in the Flatiron district, which has already been in business since the B√∂rsencrash 1929.
Seegelman, 54, ordered a fresh swimming wheel with oil bags, while coe, 57, thruth with card-floor and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbrot, the couple found it appropriate for a debate on the food at the time of the Great Depression.
"Remarkable foods were very popular", said Siegelman.
There was soil brown, lever bottles and brown brown.
They were prepared from an additive and something pleasant that strikes the additive.
Propose to eat so many earthquakes that they serve them as a dinner.
You're smell.
"It must have put himself in the magic like a leg," he said.
In the years before the great depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, a All-You-Can-Eat Buffet.
Managers of women purchased for men's field workers and it was freely backed paste for breakfast, breakfast and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War War. "A Square Meal" marked the way to which the country was struggling to be no longer the slaughter country.
"It was a time when the food was a central, encouraging theme for the Americans," Coe favoured why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget was also encouraging: secret foods such as bread and caserolls were made to basic foods, which casser oils were "a great type of food", noted Seegelman, since the kitchen was able to hide in a creative sugar.
Fresh fruit was replaced by bigger seed fruit.
The meat of the United States kitchen was a rarely served Luxus.
Personal mixtures were tested because a calorian rich and accurate satisfaction was priority for smell or even healthy kitchen.
During their search for the book, which also includes the receptions, the seeds prepared a court from this era, backed swimming swimming swimming snacks.
"It wasn't a favorite addition on the midst", says Coe.
Seegelmann continues to say, "It was surreal."
Boiling bottles and backed strikes do not match each other.
It was typically for many of the household responses.
As never before or since, budgetary employees - including Louise Stanley, Leader of the Federal Office of Home Economics, between 1923 and 1943 - are the habitats of the country.
In publishing receptives and articles in newspapers and magazines, women encouraged them to become "budgetary policyers" and to transform the challenges to be justified by pamps such as creme spaghetti with karotes in cooking times.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of the historical lecker beasts.
In particular, the reports on the response of the Government to the poor citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Cine-Essen.
While he publicly loversed the simple Iowa farmhouse cook of his kitchen, he spent like the million thick man of the world to whom he became.
"He might have a continental kitchen like fish with guckensauce," said Coe.
He eated in a almost shocked food room and took a smoking.
He was amazing of reality.
President Roosevelt may have started the same error if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his magic.
As described in the book, a householder was not interested by Ms. Roosevelt to produce the white house the latest food in Washington, but also one of the most comfortablely prepared."
Many of the species from the era of Great Depression were rejected when the country returned to the leg.
The resources are on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Siegelman, and on how food science has been applied.
The couple gave the eating habits of Siegelman's mother's swimming mother, for example, how they couldn't remove food.
"He had a real fear of the abuse of food," said Coe.
Siegelman recalled: "They actually made people sick."
There was the windstorm.
After the tears were displaced at Eisenberg, they and Coe moved a dessert that they had prepared at home: the floor swimming snake, the President Roosevelt eat at midday.
"It will be called Prune Whip," said Siegelman and added that it was a common trick to pass a sent name.
There was no shoes cut, only plants, some meat, sugar, water and Zimt.
Everyone slaughtered a lift in the dense, blue lebbers.
Surely it wasn't bad.
Coe tricked a shock.
As a can-do-budget-budget said to his wife, "A few hacked whales would help."
Murdered by bomb attack: He was the herd of Aleppo
He put his own life on the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the herd of Aleppo: Khaled Omar slaughtered his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old one died at a fassbomber attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group who saved the life, according to the image record until now, about 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers set their own lives on the game to take people out of a bomb house and to provide the first help in the war area.
You're the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil protectioner, which showed him in a 11th advertising salvation of a sweet from a house, went to the world in 2014.
It made the Syrer a lighting symbolfigur in the grain of the war.
But as heroes never seen himself, he said, "For me, this is the true Jihad."
"When I die to save life, I think that God sees in me a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself lost an attack on the victim, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helikopters have made four fass bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorogas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffered from an affair.
"We remove the giftous remains of the bomb so that children do not play it", the image cites his last words before he died.
The killing bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists.
Gr√∂nlandhai: The oldest workshop is almost 400 years old
Rare look.
Gr√∂nlandhaie is usually in winter only on the surface.
This Hai took back to the sea after an investigation on the board of Sanna's research ship.
He was born 1624 and was born with a good 1 km/h through North Atlantics - up to today.
Gr√∂nlandhaie receives only 150 years of education.
The Gr√∂nlandhai slows on the ground of the North Atlantics, and in a hour it comes just 1.220 m in average.
Only when it comes out, the 5 meters long animal speeds on 2.5 km/h - and is with this maximum speed half soon as a robot.
But this long-term life style seems to be a paintercept for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the "Science" magazine in any case by a Gr√∂nlandhai who could be 392 years old.
"Whatnsinn" comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck Institute for Demographical Research in Rostock this life level, which means a world record for the workshops.
Although the biologues of evolution have long been shocked by Gr√∂nlandhaie.
Only the evidence missed.
Gr√∂nland Haies are difficult to observe, and finally they live mostly in the eism before the shooting coasts of Canada, Gr√∂nland, Norway and Spitzberg.
Because they prefer water temperatures for the six degrees of Celsius, they are most often switching on the surface.
Regarding the lifestyle of the Gr√∂nland Haie, researchers do not agree.
They made their time of time when they employed six animals before Spitzbergs with a sender.
Nevertheless, these hairs found the rest of a robot, the other had shocked the shoes of a young irongart in the magnificent.
They may be kissing sleeping animals or patrouiling on the basis of the emotion and searching cattles from higher water changes down.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Gr√∂nlandhaie, which helped fishermen from 2010 to 2013 to Gr√∂nland or Spitzbergs as a result of the depth of North Atlantic.
The smallest Hai was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters was.
To identify the age of the animals, they analyzed the lingery of the hair with the carbon 14-methods.
This center of the eyelinse has already been renewed before the birth of the Haie, the proteins contained there are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest hairs had a lot of carbon-14 in the lingery.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, as the nuclear weapons surveys slowed more quantities of this radioactive carbon fuel into the atmosphere.
However, in which with 220 centimeters of the three-century animal the lingery was a small overcome of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons survey, it should therefore have been celebrated in his study in 2012 at its 50th birthday.
However, all the largest Gr√∂nland hair had normal carbon 14-children in their lining corners, which resulted in cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14-ear showed a age of 335 years of Gr√∂nlandhai with a age of 502 centimeters even 392 years old.
That Gr√∂nlandhai women were known only when they were more than four feet.
Now the researchers were able to order a age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters standed at the slee of sex sleeves and was established with 156 years of age, Gr√∂nlandhaie is obviously allowed to reduce at least a half a century.
It should also be for the weakers today in the world's reorder.
That such methusure lives primarily in ice waters is no accident.
The previous recorder, a 211-year-old Groenlandwal, in which a 120-year-old spectacle was captured before Alaska.
With low temperatures, also the organism of the living animals are often walking on sparflammes.
So they're slower and older.
To keep warm in the cold water, the animals will also be particularly large.
Because the volume grows much higher than its surface, by which the animal heat is.
The warm loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than a gram elephant.
Another advantage: You have less enemy.
"A smaller animal, therefore, lives more dangerous and should concentrate on it, as soon as possible, to have many seeds", says the Evolutional Biological Scheerlein.
However, a very large animal should invest his resources in a long life.
Built in double package
In the recent meeting, the Council of the Communities has discussed the subjects around the buildings.
With facility, the body noted the Communication of Mr Robert Putz that "in the end, the marketing of the recent residence plants can begin".
After clarification of the basic, parcelling and resolution issues and the applications for measuring could be made, the sale of the bases in the residential areas "Stra√üweg" and "Sch√∂nau-West" (Ambient Binderstrades - Section 1) is no more interested in the way.
The Council is convinced that the construction surfaces in the rurally prescribed and tranquilous housing area are equal to young families and strict seniors.
As it is said, the Construction Volunteers can immediately report to the Council's House on the provision of the parcels will be consulted at its September meeting.
In order to be able to follow requests for further enterprises, associated with the creation of jobs, the Community Council decided to amend the area-use plan established first in the spring of this year.
In this way, in the sub-time area, the area already presented there is extended to two partial directions of the State Strategy 2112.
Frankfurt benefited from Brexit
The city in Main has the best chance of entering jobs and enterprises from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It's very likely that Frankfurt benefits most of Brexit", says Michael Voigtland, Chief of the Financial Market and IW's real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain that money households can continue from London from financial affairs in the whole EU.
For the so-called EU-Pass, they have yet been authorized in Britain.
It's just useful US banks.
several banks have already announced to reduce jobs.
The Lobby Association "Frankfurt Main Finance" calculates with 10000 new jobs at Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, so the IW, the European Central Bank (ECB) is assembled with the responsibilities for monetary policy and supervision on the largest banks of the euro area and other important authorities such as the European Insurance Monitoring EIOPA and the Risk Council.
The organization of economic cooperation and development (OECD) in Paris has its headquarters, but this is less important than the ECB.
"The nearness to the bank is important for banks, since they can communicate directly with the supervision", says the IW-Professor of the Province.
Although Luxembourg has a large fund sector, the same as Dublin was worse in infrastructure.
Frankfurt, thanks to the great airport, is clearly easier to reach.
Moreover, the city has a facility of shopping real estate.
"In Paris it's not so easy to find high-quality offices", says the Voistlands.
Moreover, the expenses for first-class shopping real estate are up to 50% higher than the main.
Frankfurt also provides higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical supply and infrastructure, as well as less criminality.
In a round of the business advice Mercer, the city was on the seventh place, Luxembourg on place 19, Dublin on the 33th and Paris 37th place.
Even if the quality of life is a question of the predecessors: "If his strong position as a financial position for the European market, Frankfurt could join further banks and investors," says the WI.
However, in spite of Brexit-Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, I believe the economic researchers.
For this also, the forces relates: In London, there were about 144 000 people in the bank industry, which were 62500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent line with Merck
A US Officer decided that Gilead Sciences Inc had the right to refund the legal costs which she had received from the Hepatite C Legislation with the Pharmacist Merck & Co Co Inc.
In June Gilead was released by a damage payment of $200 million for the injury of the two patents of Merck, which were in relation to the Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US-relator was discovered by Mercks, including my idea and other non-thetic acts.
On Thursday, the complainant at the U.S. Officer Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to accept the costs during the defence of the case.
Merck tries to compare with Gilead that controls the market of hepatitis C medicines that can result in over 90% of patients with hepatitis disease.
The case is returned to 2013 when Gilead and Merck were declared mutually and ownershipd on laboratory works based on sofosbuvir, the active content substance in the medicines of Gilead.
The United States supported soldiers say they have returned completely controlled by Man near the Islamic state

"The city is now under perfect control, but we're just working through space," he told Reuters.
Clintons won 10,75 million in 2015 and pay 34,2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax statement on Friday 2015, which took a revenue of 10.75 million USD and a effective fiscal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clinton's USD 1 million depended on the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton produced almost 5,3 million USD in Redehororaren; the former Minister of Foreign Affairs accumulated a income of $3 million from the Single & Schusster for its book on its office in the foreign minister.
Clinton's Candidate for the Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, has published his tax statements together with his wife Anne Holton in the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continued to set standards for financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a disadvantaged opposition, Donald Trump has been hiding its tax statements behind false speech and backfalls in respect of his previous discussions.
It is usually to publish their tax statements for the US Presidency candidates, although they are not bound by laws.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have identified a fiscal examination by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"It's on the train," wrote Clinton's election assistor Ian Sams on Twitter, with regard to the publication of the Presidential Chairman of Democratics.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Special Adviser of Trumps, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax tests were completed.
Trumps Critics, including the Republican Presidency Chairman of 2012 Mid Romney, have already endorsed that his refusal of questions relating to property, its costs for voluntary organizations, its business opportunities and different links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already argued on the topic and published a video on the Internet on Friday calling for the high-ranging Republican Trump to publish its tax statement.
On Thursday, she also spoke the topic during a talk to the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other candidate has done in the last decades and to publish its tax statements." she said to the amount.
Political reported that Trump has not paid a few taxes for the 1990s, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax applicants and tax advisers that indicate that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme designated by the Millennium and Investor Warren Buffet, which would ensure that people who pay more than one million USU would pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
Mr Obama also supports the proposal.
During a Hillary Clinton campaign in the past week in Omaha, Nebraska, the Berkshire Hathaway Industrie Conglomerate has his seat here to share a meeting on their tax statements.
Buffett said he was also subject to a fiscal examination of the IRS and Trump had ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù before the electioners and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax statement back until 2007.
The Clintons, who are now in Chappaqua, New York, lived, averagely paid a effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combinated tax rate of about 40.5%.
The tax statement of the Clintons in 2015 showed that they only shared 100 USD of their income as a loan, other than the majority of all Americans.
Your main currency allocation was a more costly index fund, from which the Clinton's Dividents and Income of US 109.000 taxed.

Condomes with chilipuds, fire bodies promote Tanzanias Elefanten protection
Natural protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox type to stop elephants from walking in people's population seeds - they cut condomes that are filled with chilipuds.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which has been the idea for years ago, has intensified its promotion together with the United States Natural Protection by training volunteers in villages in Northern Tansania to use a violent vicinity method for the protection of their homes and rewards without harming animals.
Many of them have used to defend themselves before.
Wednesday is the world's celebration of animal protection.
"When we developed the toolkit, we could observe a change in their position within these communities, while they are much more convinced that they can stop the elephants from their fields without harming the ellips," the director of Honeyguide Damian Bell expressed in a communication.
The first two steps include the shooting of the elephant with a fake and the blowing into a horn.
If he isn't scared, a cyliwolke will be covered.
Chilipoid mixed with earth is packed together with a fire-fed body in a condom, which is turned to the end to the thirst.
When it is sent down, the condome is put up with a kidnapper and splits a fine steel of chilipuder in the air.
A shooting is in the ordinary way already in order to spend the elephants.
A last possibility is a converter who shoots a golden light fire work in the air and causes a slight, light explosion.

Jewish Governor deceives the Berlin Hotel, because Israeli predict has been removed after "Arabian" invitation - RT News
A French government with Jewish roots tried a media survey after he surprised that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-elect, since it was called by an Arab guest "required".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" left his injuries in Kpienski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel‚Äôs country officer.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was removed and removed?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel through a own call centre.
After a statement, the Governor moved to the hotel response.
The answer he received there was "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employer said that the measure is a "absolute decision to the management of the Kempinski Hotel".
The reason that was there was, in the government, more wrath was dissolved.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they have requested that the election be removed," was sent to the employee of Lanzmann.
The Israeli messanger in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the Southern newspaper.
We were cut from this event and struggled.
It's really awesome.
The fact that this has been given in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more harmful.
This does not require any statement.
We expect that the hotel is "the right conclusions", said the Officer.
The incident made a very big resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole skandal.
Some claimed to the Kempinski Hotel that it had been the appropriate calls for Arab guests "inviting".
"Shom you," said another contribution, in which it was indicated that the hotel situated at the noble curve dam is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly observed all the accused of himself and called the incident a "verification" and "excused" at Lanzmann, reports The Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction," the Southern newspaper quoted a speaker of the Kpienski Hotel.
It adds that the country's preference has now been added.
Police instructs Tr√§ngas and Gummi shocks against protesting Brazilian students
Students met the police together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, when they gathered together to demonstrate the reforms of the government for the public education system.
The police shocked the shooting gas and shooting against the demonstrates.
The difficulties argued that as police officers tried to interfere to students, which resulted in the use of Gummi shoot and gas.
Many hundreds of students took part in the demonstrations to express their infringement over the plans.
According to the proposals of the Federal Governor of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, some less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students are implemented to shoot money.

Trade between Russia and Iran is suddenly increased to 71% - RT Business
The russ messager in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran in the year compared to 70.9 per cent.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been decreased, the interest on Russian businesses in the country was strongly able to share the messagers.
Russian enterprises take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to create access to the market.
Of course, the further trade development is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that the trade sum between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran increased 91.5% springly and $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 per cent to $158 million.
The trade was reached by delivering machines, aircrafts and weapons", said the messager.
Dzhagaryan is exhibited by a number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year the Russian foreign association exhibited around 35,000 visas, in the main line of travel visa, to Iranian citizens.
On the other hand, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries, as regards the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia have been broken last year," he said.
At the same time, only few Russians will visit Iran, something from which the messager hopes that it will change.
"I can personally recommend the visit of the towns of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd who have received monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Tests Search: Overcome the drink market in the bowlbr oil
A swimming accident has been shocked on the drink market of Rewe XXL on the forest bridge trails.
With the maintenance of a shooting weapons, three dark persons who were shocked with their faces requested the production of bargeld and then flew first on foot and then probably with a silver VW-golf.
The police does not share the money.
The murders should have been large between 1.60 and 1.70 m, so relatively small.
The drinking market is directly accessible and badly adjustable from the parking of the rewe market.
The murders must be launched in direction to Gerber Streets, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and flyed with the silver car, perhaps in direction B 256 (slaughtering).
Those who have observed at 19.45 p.m. in relation to the shooting accident must be reported urgently to the police.
Nagold: game and fun at summer free time
Eight beautiful and happy days, the children and youths of the social-day/social working group of Nagold with their employees on their summer free time in Nussdorf, near M√ºhlacker.
In a quiet free-time house, Hardtw√∂ldle, the live-friendly group was rounded during the first school feast.
several full-day flights were on the program.
To one, it went to Bretten with the visit of the Strichel Zoos.
For the other part of the muscles, where there was a special child management in the world-known club.
The third flight leaded to Pforzheim.
In the Kellen Museum in Hochdorf, the group has learned much over the daily and food of the caves.
At the hot days, the group was enjoyed at the Deep Sea in the Moulbrons, which was invoked for spring, smiling and plants.
Curinally, children and guards were shocked with their own preparated body specimens such as the slaughter, the sea sourcenle, the islandshauser-bloff, the English-Breakfast and the T√ºbinger Bologne.
In workshops, we've been built sweet shoes from skins and stones or made of wood a Roman music game.
Additional highlights of the free time were the angels in a close teacher, the nights on the fire and the final "But night".
On the day of the home journey, the sun and the children and youth rejoiced home.
Hagerloch: Pilgers for the braveness of mercy
The Ministers from the Seelsorge Unit Eyachtal-Hangerloch St. Anna were on a four-day migration of Villingen to Freeburg.
In general, four steps were closed.
To overcome the time until the next Romwal flight of all Ministers for two years, the Supreme Ministerround St. Anna has decided to prepare and implement a multi-term migration process.
A number of shipping targets were examined and finally decided to the Bishops City Freeburg, where, in this year, the holy Year of mercy was offered a special pillar in the Freeburg M√ºnster.
16 Mines of browns, gruols, hairbows, and sacred rooms were made on the path.
On the evening, Pharaoh Storost sent the Pilger in a small holiday in St. Anna, blessed the Pilger Cross and distributed the pillars.
From Horb was moved by train to the startpoint of Villingen, where a monster of Our Love Women is also, and so the piller journey was taken from the monster.
The individual day tours were rounded by a short impuls with various prayers, songs and texts.
But on the way, the Minis of Field Cross, Capelles or Churches continued to sing together a song of their own composed Pilger song.
For the overnights, the Pharaoh houses of the local parriage were available.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were careful for a sweet and strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, it was about fortwangs to Goodtenbach.
On the day, the step went to St. Peter, who was the most surrounding road, had to shoot about 500 meters of height and then be shocked again.
The winning reward was finally a common grill on the bathroom.
After the morning impetus on the fourth pillar day in the imminent clergy of St. Peter, it was on the clothes table to Freeburg.
It seems to be easy and happy to the minis on afternoon on the Freeburg monastery and extended the courages of mercy.
With a small empire, God has been grateful here.
In the monastery, the minister of Cooperator Markus Obert arrived at the Pilger target.
After God‚Äôs service, the philosophers were able to consider the sacred and the higher.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumeterpole.
The afternoon, it went back to Horb.
All participants agreed that the days of spirit and a strong Community experience were presented.
Shote Callum Skinner shoots home when Britain Gold for Radsport
Skotlands Callum Skinner last night at the men's sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to Ruhm, when the British team defended London's title in 2012.
The 23-year-old boy of Glasgow took the aker role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself own. The boy point was proud of the legends when he went home to a victory of the New Zealand favorites.
England sent a shocking victory four years ago, while today the fifth of six Olympiagold medailles.
They repeated the trick, after they received only a wide sixth place in March at the Railway World Meetings in London, although the return of Hoys.
The problem between Peking and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did so at the time as Hindus.
Hoys relaxation created a laugh to close Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was the man in whom she stayed when she saw the potential in the shoot that now disappeared.
Independent, Kenny, who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner put an olympic receptor in the qualifications rounds, but in the standard rounds, the new countries spended on the first round.
And the British Trio wins the dual with gold.
Indeed, after his round, Kenny was back, but Kenny brought the team before and Skinner took it.
A strategic change made a large part of the transformation in India in a higher gang to delay it and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the time.
Hoy looked out of his position as BBC experts and went to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they went to the power.
The 23-year-old skiner from Glasgow said, "It's a ridicule comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We set an olympic repair at the end of the end and the world's master.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph 2012 on the Kenny and Hoys side, Hindes gave him to a weak start on the train.
He returned this statement later, and there was no involvement of the British Rivalen.
There was no such problem at such an overwhelming victory this time.
India said, "It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London."
We've been together as a team in the last three months.
We've been so bad in so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again with the Olympiad.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were winned by seven of 10 titles both in Peking and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we are expected to be successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form of Kenny, it is in the area of the possibility that he can win from three olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would be for Kenny - the precisely 12 years older than today, which was also born on March 23 (a apparently sacred date for the British sport; on the day, also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - means an exhibition of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's the same thing by Hoy.
Kenny takes part as next in the sprint that starts today and goes over three days.
The 28-year-old of Bolton said, "I enjoyed this only for the moment."
The team's heritage is always the best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels unique to win alone.
Inded said, "If he wins two other gold medals, he should be shocked to rider."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was further good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were qualified with the fastest performance in four-kilometers.
They reached the goal in 3:51,942.
The World Reorder, winned in London's Gold 2012, was at 3:51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) is held today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be safely focused.
Last night he had struggled with officers before the qualification when he was calling officers to measure his body size.
In the corresponding wedding competition, which is continued and ended tomorrow, the advanced Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavia in World Record in 4:13.260.
The GB team leaves its strong station team to dominate the average period of the Olympic games and take a sharp of medailles.
After a truly extraordinary exhibition of absolute domination in Peking and London, the expectations for Rio were understood.
The dramas were decreased in the background, so the retreat of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April was in the midst of sexism and mobing projects, as well as the rest of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary call GBs, which has reached its uppoint for the perfect moment.
The future of the Portland Skill Sea is a questionable cause of relief of the energy contract.
The future of the Aluminium Skills of Portland in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, are on the game, since the installation operators announce the energy delivery contract and will thus decrease all delivery contracts, as the supplier shared the energy company.
This step was followed by the Government‚Äôs decision in Victoria in the beginning of this year to forgive no further subsidies for the operation of the installation.
A subvention set for 20 years shall expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa installation in Portland are on the game.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be threatened when closing.
Furthermore, it could be to domino effects, since the smell series consumption around 10% of the entire generation of Victorias.
2014 Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzerei, which leaded to a closure of the English power work last year.
Alcoa's snake in Portland loses money and risks a close.
This step follows the annual speculations regarding the future of the installation, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar, and finally because of the strike for the installation.
AGL, who delivered the large aluminium snake with his Loy Yang A Motorwerk in Latrobe Valley, shared it that three other owners would be announced their contracts.
The installation is located in the majority of a Joint Venture of Alcoa and Alumina, where the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp is smaller.
"AGL understood that the installation in Portland will continue to operate, which means another physical demand for electricity through the steel serum," the company shared.
AGL continued to conclude that the contracts called "safeguards" should have entered into force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month proclaiming period so that they will end 2017.
"For this reason, the AGL concludes that the contracts will be contributed to the revenue in the business year 17", said the supplier.
All potential effects on AGL revenues from GJ 18 are currently limited by the prognoses of the strong term markets for large-scale routes.
AGL reported that it had already registered the value of the contracts in its annual decree of $187 million in "Warning a proclamation".
Alcoa said that the decision to register the treaties, the "Facility Alcoas... or to ensure electricity supply to the slopes" does not affect the decision.
The US undertaking said that it had concluded a 20-year treaty with Loy Yang in 2010 that had to enter into force by November this year, even if there was a delegation of why it was returned to the Treaty.
Analyticers warned because of the bad economic situation of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago installation near Newcastle.
As regards the comments of the analytics at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatt and Tomago about 900 megawatt in electricity.
If both installations disappeared from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in the demand on the [Strom market].
And for us, it wouldn't be good," he said.
More than just one Kardashian Reality TV Star, Kendall is on the cover of the September Exhibition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Crisis is on the cover of the employed September Exhibition of Vogue.
Kendall, the Markenschafter of Estee Lauder, and delivered to the Fashion Weeks in Mayland, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on his instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I brought the view of this copper to wine," wrote Kendall.
The interpretation of the covers followed a strange (or simply Keeping Up similar to the Kardashians), scripted reality video that shows the entire Kardashians family (except the cases of Rob and Caitlyn, and at the presence of the most popular showbiz rings and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), how they forgot the cover of their sister and ends with a classic vision: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the clinical detention nearly every birthday session of a child's seat (Seacrest gave the sentence, "Do you think we had forgotten you?", with the honor of a sign trickcanin on a sending place at 8:00 a.m.), but the crisis of her other girls had to take part in this publicity.
With regard to the September Exhibition of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashian began with security.
Kendall's large sister Kim likes to have struck the Vogue Cover (see and her husband Kanye West were to see it in April 2014), but the cover of September‚Äôs magazine is a liga for himself.
The expenditure for September is the most sales expenditure of the year.
A large number of advertising advertising users, with a range that is more different than a model band, is a large number of publishers (See Fashionista was 832 pages of the tree 615 pages of advertising).
The enthusiasming of his coverstars is so sweet that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine were still overseated before the official advertisement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In the last few years, clearly more "beauty messages, models" were on the cover.
Oscar-President and Dior-Markebourer Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even when the small opportunity that Ms. Jenner, which is described by the magazine as the "Durchbroch model" model of its generation, is under the previous category, it is in a good society.
These fascinations are not related to famous people or reality Stars or youths from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (such as it applies everything to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who represent themselves in the entertainment sector.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had been published by Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner's success does not like any.
With its reality TV history, Jenner's position in the modern world was always a little encouraging.
In June, the one Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid critised her "the mist of the moment".
These feelings come back when the message with the appearing Jenners came out on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems to be overlooked at the point.
Kenndall Jenner is on the cover of the September Exhibition of Vogue.
She's a super model in the true sense of the word.
She goes for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all their sisters sell pictures of you on their own Paywall apps.
She sells from her images made by Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her free time she is to see in the reality TV. Probably only to see her sister Kortney and her children.
Common law centres indicate the annual decrease of 160,000 people
More than 160,000 of the aid needs of the country are declined annually by the Community Independent Rights Centres, while the sector has taken place on the impact of further means-free transactions.
In Queensland there are already three of five people - most older people, immigrants, helpful employees, victims of violence and those who have no funds for unrighteous delays and similarly - when requests for free legal consultation and legal assistance.
The legalist services of the community, which are already exceededed, are prepared for further turbulents.
From June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose more than 30% of their federal resources.
The Director of the Common Rights Centers of Queesland James Farrell said that the last reception of the National Association of Common Rights has shown that thousands of people are already discarded each year.
Farrell said that the situation would be worse without a delay of the federal government's decision.
"Queensland's commun rights centres are chronically financed, which means that thousands of people from important services you need," he said.
People who abandon violent relationships, people with inevitable and impressable debts, families that go through separations, workers who have been dismissed unjustly - all of these people have problems of legal nature, and this intelligence shows that they are not able to receive the help they need.
Since June 2017, the Federal Government will shorten the funds to 30%, which means that thousands of helping people from Queensland will be forced to respond to their legal problems without any assistance.
We call on the general lawyer and the Federal Justice Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to cut these shortages closely, so that people can receive the aid they need in legal problems.
Last year, the country's government complied its contribution to enhance legal aid to the national average.
It is now at the time to look at the needs of the Common Rights Centres and their customer communitys and that the Palestinian government investes in this important work.
Donald Trump Select campaign sentenced after the employees to go to the weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sentenced because of an inactivity, after you were informed that her Championship Chief for North Carolina in February had a shooting weapons on a employee, while they walked in a Jeep in February.
The case is described in an appeal record submitted by Vincent Bordini on midnight by Charlotte, a former software program for the campaign in this State.
Bordini agreed to have expected for months that the matter would be regulated inside before he realized that "it wouldn't happen".
The Championship Chief, Earl Philip, moved a pistole, put his right guard fingers on the distance, and took the path in Vincents Kniekehle," gave Bordini in his charge.
After he was dealing with the local and regional campaign, Bordini realized that at least four other people had done the same experience with Phillip, he acknowledged in the appeal.
"Whos must not be shocked to harm," Bordini replied.
The appeal is only two days after the Republican Presidency candidate dissolved a surrender when he said a human dimension in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - shooting and weapons friends - should take action if his rivalin Hillary Clinton is chosen and the judges should be called.
Trump's campaign cleared that the media would disappear his words from the context and that he would not attack violence.
The complaint demands the injury of the campaign to rape the responsibilities and by Philip because of physical damage and remaining seal damage.
Trump's Presenter Hope Hicks was not reached for an opinion.
Try to contact Philip also missed.
WCCB, a local newspaper in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is not a long worker of the campaign.
On calls to his consulting company, innovative consultation services, has not been reacted.
The Republican Presidency candidate Donald Trump has held a controverse campaign until now.
The procedure was established by Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Oberstes Court, Council of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Swana: Research against country choice: lost SPD and CDI
In the subsequent elections in the Federal States, Mecklenburg Forums (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), there are significant losses for the government partys SPD and CDPs.
This provides representative investigations from the InSA Opinion Institute for the "Image" publication (Freeday).
While the red-free government coalition could soon continue to register in the north, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.
In two federal countries, however, the SPD would have the strongest party and would have a good opportunity to continue to put the government head.
In Mecklenburg, the SPD was 35.6 per cent of five years ago.
The Party, according to the investigation, was only just before the DDC, which could return to 23%.
The third place is round between the left and the AfD.
The left was 19% (before 18.4%), the ADD would first be 19% on Sunday.
The greens, despite easier losses of 6 percent (before 8,7%), returned to the black landday.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 percent on the landday.
In the Berlin House, the SPD is only 23 per cent of the investigation (World 2011: 28.3 per cent).
The CDD only reached 18% after 23.4%.
It was still behind the green with 19 percent (2011: 17.6%), but before the left with 15 percent (forwardly 11,7%).
The ADD would first be 14% in the House of Deputy.
With 5 per cent, the FDP could hope to return, but the pirates would, on the contrary to 2011, pass the income.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first Smartphone
E-mail and Internet in timelupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The followers dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device was almost half kilograms and was more than four times so hard as a iPhone 5.
It was smooth and larger, so it was not good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was very slight.
At first eight megabytes, which would be limited to about two semi with high resolution today.
A iPhone is supplied with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, in the business - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, the favorites can buy the devices still on the Internet, but they are somewhat from the stone time of the Internet Time.
However, 20 years ago the Communicator was a sense.
The Finnish mobile manufacturer announced the product a few months ago on the computer measuring Cebit in Hannover as "B√ºro in the Western Tower Format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to be sent and received for old standards, even by fax, to reach the Communicator.
Even the access to web sites was possible by HTML browser, even slowly.
A touch computer was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small Antenne, and the phone could be kicked like a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black-wheel screen were found.
The price was very proud: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 euros.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was EUR 392.
Nobody could admit in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the start of the Smartphone era.
Since then, it's different.
The sound phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.
The phone part of the Finn experienced an unfair disaster, was finally sold and completed to Microsoft.
Today the market dominates suppliers who were all later coming as Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, this is for many people today.
2015 was nearly two billion Smartphone users worldwide.
About 1,4 billion of devices were sold, on assembly and apple, only 555 million pieces.
The global transfer with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
These are the good-driven businesses of countless app providers and telecommunications centers.
A whole industry has been round around the smartphone.
The decisive interruption to the mass market was first early in 2007, then Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and a Internet communitor, all by the touch screen easy to use.
Apple's victory began, even today the iPhone is the most important product of the concert.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the view.
They're finally lost to fight Blackberry.
The seage now has Apple and Asian providers such as Samsung.
The Smartphone is an autonomy 20 years after its introduction.
In the switch today each German looks 88 times on the day on his phone.
"We all have to learn to remove the smartphone again," just said Janina Kugel, responsible for staff in Siemens.
Persistent accessibility applies to the midst of wickedness and blessings.
England has to develop the Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow
Heathrow is not only in our local communities and in the whole of London, but also in the whole country renewing and well-being.
For me it was the greatest attraction Heathrows, as in 2012 in London, when we run a great encouraging to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics had great advantages for Stratford and East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local accommodations and enterprises near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will be only 10,000 new schools, create 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were forecast in London in 2012, it will be given that the challenge of Heathrows expanding is too large.
I was said that England will never be ready for the games and that we will burn on the world's blows.
The dubbles had injustice 2012, and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he put.
Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is a infrastructure project for many and not individuals.
Advanced is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, ¬£211 billion to skilled growth and leave a ability and employment risk for both the airport and the whole GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow which has implemented a ¬£11 billion tea infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 to five years after the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequency of the world.
Now they are ready to provide a third stage, which is supported by ¬£16 billion to private investments.
The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am convinced that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.
It is time to spend this olympic spirit and enhance Heathrow and ensure our future trade, creating a richness of qualifications and employment, which can be proud of England.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook on "Katz and mouse game"
For enterprises who pay money with online delivery, one of the software manufacturer tries to handle an indication block, a "catz and mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocks on his desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post that the users could update their filters in the program to lock again advertising in social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the encoding regarding its advertising advertising in order to discover the display blocks of what part of the page of advertising is to be identified.
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to run the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "This kind of fight between the spectacular open source Community and the circle is already in the gate, and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been in the battle is a strong indication for how careful display blockers have become for the sector.
The worldwide uses a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe around 200 million people's show blockers; almost four times as much as 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users who are accessing to Facebook on their mobile advertisements, 84 per cent of the Facebook advertising advertising comes.
The company has seen it on display blockers on desktop PCs, since mobile displays blockers have no effect on mobile app on Facebooks for the social network and instagram, they shared a speaker.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient share of revenue, so Facebook shows investment in such a step as a loan value.
On Tuesday Facebook shared it would update its "more preference center" to have more control over the people about them.
On Thursday, Facebook said that Adblocks would be worried about new filters because they would also block contents on the side that are not advertising.
"If users don't have a positive experience, so we plan to discuss the problem," a Facebook speaker shared in an email communication.
Show blockers are a smooth means, for instead we have focused on development tools like Ad Preferences to put more control into people's hands.
Women in Swiss's swimming automobile murder
The victim was in the middle of the night on the train.
The police calls witnesses after a woman was passed in the early morning on Thursday at a convictional suicide of several vehicles on a train.
The incident was held on the A1 near Morges in Canton Waadt after midnight.
One woman put himself in the dark area "in an act of destruction" on the street and was taken by several cars, said the police in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss age of 49 years, who had been overlooked by several vehicles, including a car, would have been killed.
She's still in a place.
More drivers have already been called, but some have not yet been identified, the police asked them and all the Witnesses of the case to report.
There was an investigation procedure opening what is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared Le Tribune de Gene.
However, it remains expected if one of the drivers is shown.
Was it possible to avoid a constraint?
This is something that the lawyer must decide," said the Court.
Two similar cases in the past five years show that the drivers are not responsible.
In each of the two cases, in which one in the dark trail passed on the train, it was decided that the drivers shouldn't get out of that a footground walks in the night on the train, as it was called in the newspaper.
Last year a police officer was released after she survived and murdered a man, who was on the A1 night near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been taken and became unconscious on the street, near the court.
The Court observed that the police -- who had responded to an emergency -- had been in a fair way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation", said the judge.
Any more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should be reported at the police referred to in number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was one day living
The Venus said that the projections of a new NASA climate model would probably be living at one time.
Scientists at Goddard Institutes for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that compare with climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have found its hot, water-free surface and CO2-diving atmosphere at first desperate conditions.
Scientists previously indicated that Venus could be declared by its deep atmosphere.
But the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a slight, desperate atmosphere and, however, slowly turned up.
The model also lighted the topography of the early Venus.
The planet seemed likely to be more stable areas than the earth, but he had enough water and geographical variables to hide life and protect fast consumption.
The previous Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30% of the matter.
"In the GISS-model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day page of the sun almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press communication.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a swimming swimming cloud, which is like a rain screen to remove the surface of a large part of the sunwarm.
The results are average temperatures that are some degrees more cold than the earth today.
The model introduced a history of Venus, which plays the evolution, which was previously stimulated by planet researchers.
Although she was certainly habitable, the Venus was -- in the course of thousands of years -- too much heat and ultraviolet light exhibited.
Their oceans were shocked and their water shock was burned from the ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogens also remained a deep atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a mortal trend effect -- the Venus, which we know them today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy comes back as an avalanche trainer
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche, and adopted a small co-determination right to the team's decision process.
Alternativ President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the Agreement will immediately search for a new trainer.
"In the past three years I have fulfilled my obligations as Chief Reactor and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, suffering and certainty", said the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
In the summer, I have been thinking about how I could improve this team in order to give him more deep, that needs it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly agreed on the organization.
He must also have a right to participate in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are not implemented at present.
Sakic, the Roy, who had joined on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick has informed me today of this decision," said Sakic.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization, and we want him only the best for the future.
Roy was exhibited as a winner of the Jack Adams Awards during his debut session at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the best trainer of the liga.
He led the Agreement on 112 points and on the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was shocked at the first round of the Playoffs of Minnesto and passed the posts in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches marked a 39-39-4 mark in the season 2015-16 and turned back to the wild for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference to five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadians and the Avalanche.
Northern Oil workers will re-educate discussions, put strikes out
The workshops on the dislocation of North Sea workers were exempted, while all the parties were put on the table for a new discussion round.
The strike against the Oil Service Group, Wood Group, was specifixly performed on platforms in the North Sea, which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Units and RMT companies can confirm that we have joined us to re-start the process of the current combat," says a common statement.
We will hold some full-term meetings in the next weeks, which will begin the beginning of the next year to re-establish the problems.
The workshops said that their last strike, which was the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible payment shortages from up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced the rates of its contractors in the North Sea around 9 percent because of negative market pressure.
The rate reduction of the company is followed by a decrease of 10 per cent for Onshore advocators in 2014.
The company said that additional rates to the company have the necessary space to come through the market decline.
She has left thousands of people and announced plans to give its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business activities as a result of its mega-assembly with the British energy company BG.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower low-level prices, a economic situation which had been strengthened by the decision of Britain in June to leave the European Union.
The Scotia Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with employer leaders in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the largest jobs that have been held since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and in the whole country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few", he said in a statement.
2016 less than $1.4 billion in expenditure for new projects in the North Sea are expected in comparison with average $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler missing rotation rate of stars in the skeleton of the pearls
The latest mission with Kepler World Space Telescope has helped astronoms to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the stern purchaser of the universe.
The new data helps the astronomy to understand why stars are switching on different ratios in stars and in which the rotation periods are linked to the increase in the planet.
"We hope that we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of its sun systems," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's infrared Processing and analysis centre in Pasadena, in a press communication.
The star shop of the Mediterranean is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star shop, who had about 125 million years ago, now reach adults.
You're turning back in the fastest time now.
To spot rotation rates, these slightly swimming stars shock great amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a blown effect on the stars.
When a star is old, its rotation rate starts to delay.
Kepler misses the rotation rate of each star by he recognizes the time between the appearance of a recognisable star fleet -- like sunfalls --.
The latest catalog of rotation rates points out that massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancing, with larger stars of lower pirates than smaller.
"The "ballet" of the pitches we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, where faster rotors tend to be very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the stars are close to the pearls, it will be an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare star qualitys such as rotation rates.
"The star buyers of the pearl offers an anchor for theoretical models of the star rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
It's still much before us about what we want to learn more how the way, how the time and why stars delay their rotation rates and thus strike their "shoes".
Rebull and their colleagues have reported in three newspapers about their recent analysis of the rotation rates of the Astronomical Journal, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A strict baseball star enters
The heats were faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US Basseball Star in the best day of base to base.
After his emotional return advertisement, the 41-year-old Profi will last time take the Tricot of its New York Yankees on August 12th against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' both," the 14-year-old All-Star Game partners of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was chosen as the most valuable player of the Liga, 2009 he wins the World Series with the Yankees.
His subscription under a ten-year contract was deemed to him from 2007 to $27 million.
To the end of the contract, on 31 December 2017, he works as consultants and youth coach, in full content.
As player, Rodriguez paid long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and the Yankees created a few milestones since 2005.
With the Hall-of-Family members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays only two other baseball players show similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old boys should not be included in the baseball's rule.
Because so successful Rodriguez - Spitzname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so sharp is his appearance outside the place.
In 2009, the superstar was prepared for "ESPN" to adopt steroids prohibited between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, it was scanned by 211 parties because of a development in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is the principal suspect to have been obtained through an anti-aging clinic in Southern Florida.
After a rule of law, the sperm was still reduced to 162 visits.
"The liga could have done me even a accident for 2014, because I have spent 20 years without pause", said Rodriguez at that time.
He also did not lose his appointment day.
While many Baseball legends in their last games received the big bridges again, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job does not contain decision-tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game," Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi latest.
Rodriguez was always married to the shore player Cameron Diaz and was subjected to the situation with Popster Madonna and the player Kate Hudson, Sympathy opinions of the fans of Yankee-Erzrivalen Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the attachors read at the 4-9-related position against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekowa and Adrian targetinski are the first Doping Cases
Note: Because of a positive doping test, Adrian targetinski should not start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are exceeded by the first official doping accidents.
A surprising athline would almost win a medaille.
Before the seventh Wednesday, the first official doping cases have been known the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese Skimmer Chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekowa's 3000-metre-in-third swimming pool from Bulgaria and the Poland-weight Adrian targetinski, were tested positively and excluded in Brazil - directly before the start of the lightletic competition without critical critical.
In Chen last Sunday the diureticum hydrochlorothiazid was demonstrated as massing means for doping substances.
The International Sport Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old boys had the fourth place in the finale over 100 m Schmetterling, only about 0.09 seconds she passed the bronze medaille.
On Friday, Chen had to participate in the proposals over 50 m freestyle.
Chen requested the opening of the B test and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The National Association takes the matter "severely and demands full cooperation with Chen at the research", quoted in a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sport Court of Auditors and accept the judgment."
The first time in the history is not more the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of sports with positive cases.
At the same time, in Rio's night, the news about the positive test at Danekova, the 33-year-old girls went to the open.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV Sender BNT.
She is innocent, "the only declaration could be food supplementary", explained the Leichtathletin.
According to the report, it should be the EPO for the prohibited substance.
Danekova has been suspended promptly, according to BNT, the BT test should also be positive.
Bulgarian President Bojko Borissow, Minister of Ministers Bojko Borissow, urged to speak with criticism to the athlette.
"I don't understand why the sports don't get the right conclusions," he said, "we are in the observations of the Bulgarians, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, nearly all weight captains from the chronic doppiest nation cannot participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympicist in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days ago on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both the adoption shall be determined, however, not to start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the light-to-level, the Danekova case is a further severe shock for the reputation of the whole sport.
The World Association IAAF had understood the full Russian manity until an exception of the systemic dopings, also the production of Kenia has produced many bad news in Rio.
Moreover, in the Swiss sport, the previous conduct in China had also been conducted for intense interferences between the athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt took the Chinese Olympicist Sun Yang hard.
"Sun the lila."
"If I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to send me", said Lacourt in French radio.
Sun also was at the center of a interference with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and no respect for Doping shopers," said it.
Sun was tested positively at the Chinese masterships at the stimululans Trimetazidine, but only one three-month specimen was required.
Data clause: so perfide printing hacker her loss payment
Programmers of Press-Malware are currently employed and are successful.
According to the current survey of Malware-Specialist Malware tickets under 540 companies in North America, Britain and Germany, 40% of the enterprises engaged in the last 12 months were at least once a few times of victims of a attack with Erpresser software.
In Germany, about 20% of the companies had already been targeted by a ransomware press.
40% of the victims were willing to pay the losses requested by the murders in order to re-use the attacked systems and data.
The murders specialize their empressor software according to the observations of malware bytes, viewing attacks in farm networks.
If it is successful, the potentially pressed loss payment is clearly higher than in private users.
"We now observe a huge rapid evolution of the damage software," Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski says in conversation with the "the world".
The majority of malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the murders discovered the printing software for themselves.
First, private users were the goal, but the changing to farmnattacks had been shocked in the past months.
Ransomware works after a simple template: once active on the computer of a victim, it aims to search for long-term changed files such as Word, Excel, or database files, as well as files from images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and remove the originals sustainablely.
Then the software presents the demands of the printer.
To get the final encryption code to files, the victims need to send money - mostly in the form of the Bitcoin cryption.
However, where private users are on the game, the company is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is slow.
Indeed, the damage is higher when a rail machine applies.
22% of the interested German companies reported the losses of transfer by rainsomware, 13% even had to be completely interrupted with business activities, in a case of people in life.
In Germany a number of times of hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients may have been affected by the loss of hospitals.
"We always say the victims: don't pay, you're only promoting the problem," said Kleczynski.
However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies paying their data again.
For the manager, it is difficult to delay the demand of the murders faced by still stand in the exploitation.
The hackers know this again and try to build a good reputation.
In a current study, the security researchers of F-secure have studied the user surfaces and the contact with the printers and have come to the result: The murders really try to build a kind of customer service to get more money.
They explain their victims by chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, provide free support websites to be encrypted or decrypted for examples.
And privacy will be resolved after payments of few hundreds of euros, enterprises must deal so hardly and pay five-third amounts to return their data uncrypted.
In view of the potentially higher and relatively riskless winners from the Ransomware press, the hacker will always be professional and shared the work, explains the security experts Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus provider Sophos: "A individual person can write a ransomware about one week."
However, it is most likely that it is about three or four persons.
The programers then sell their harmsoftware in the form of a software bag to the actual printer.
The previous Malware kits were stored by purchasing the malware itself, the advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"The delivery contains an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and burning can be changed", says Wisniewski.
Then the printers are looking for further hackers to distribute the freely purchased software under the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So there is one of the forums under the base, buy the seat of a crime, and another is to install the software on the most possible computers.
The payment is performed for infected computer.
"Besides the crimes are involved, then spammer with the dissemination," says Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is often known in many companies that make their data better safeguard.
More than 50% of the company-IT responsibilities in the malware bytes investigation are trusted in switching Ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
In this way, the murders are already undergoing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat for successive assessment, the deaths are threatened by the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations", says Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski.
In this way, the damage potential is higher than previously, by type of data.
The murders can also take fullly new goals in the Internet of things.
At the Hacker Conference of Defcon, demonstrated security researchers how they could have received control under the Internet related thermostat.
Within the winter, the free holding of a such blocked heat could be valued by some of the victims.
If the murders block a whole factory strategies instead of heating in future, railware could also be a subject in the industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coup√© and also the diversity of a minivan.
It seems quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same platform as the new jazz, is really flexible every day.
Although the HR-V is only smaller than 1,60 m higher, the passengers have much place in the first line and the foundation, it does not work closely.
The materials of the internal space are well processed and pleasant, only the cockpit surface depends on something.
More than comparable vehicles is the HR-V at the stage.
It is not only available for a coffer room of 453 l at high-standed and 1026 l in rounded back-levels, but there is the "Magic Seats".
This is less magic than it sounds: the seats of the back bank can be shooted like kinossel and provide stauraum that is high from the ground to the top of 1,24 m.
The copper room can be good, but the load height of 650 mm is something higher than at comparable peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l-cell with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V from up to 300 Nm in western road number areas very powerful.
However, he should do something less.
Happy is the daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l bend with 96 kW/130 PS.
Not offering an alliance.
The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamic and comfort.
But it should be something more directer.
The equipment can not open desires in the tested top variant "Executive".
The City Notbrems Assistant (worked until 32), the Collision Warning System and the Spurware Assistant.
The collision warner is sometimes irritated because he evaluates many obstacles to the ring as "facing objects".
The television assistant works very reliable.
And the intelligent timer reacts on transport marks and drys the speed when needed.
The full connection is only for the top location: 7-doll token screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI book are under the arms and are therefore obvious to reach something.
The EUR 29000 for the good equipped top is okay.
Those who do not want to invest such a lot receive the benzine from EUR 20000, which is from EUR 23000.
The engines meet the Euro-6 absorption standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a wide and daily car.
Airline not captured: Storage on flight bridges
A airline does not arrest a passenger on the flight bridge.
Because a detention is only possible for risks that are typically for air traffic, the Supreme Court of D√ºsseldorf argued (Ac: 18 U 124/14).
The clawler had broken a knife at the storch.
However, the accident would have been able to happen overall - it is a general risk of life, so the court.
The aircraft did not have to pay the man a damage.
Cases of disease: When the events are paid
Hospital holidays will only be returned after their travel when the cause of disease is safely found in the hotel.
But it is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was difficult for disasters and crimes on the second day of its Turkish permission.
She passed almost all the holidays in the room.
The vacants returned to a defective distortion that seemed to have polluted the sea water.
The family was the view that the journey was missing - and complained against the event.
The applicants did not have success before the court.
Even though the clarification was defected in the fact.
But the event stood just just before the applicant was departured.
He had to get out of it that the sea water was okay.
He therefore did not harm his information obligations, so the judgment.
There were no contaminations found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - it is possible to hear the general risk of life.
From 691 guests were only 38 sick.
The Maizi√®re said that the acts of violence prohibited by refugees in Wurzburg and Ansbach in July had been worried about further attacks.
The State should be shocked and decided to react in terrorism.
Indeed, our country will not answer the violence of the murders with hate and disappointment.
This triumph, we're not going to give the terrorists.
If criminals should leave the country more quickly, it increases security and also strengthens the approval of the population for refugee policy.
The Maizi√®re wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the Federal Day of 2017.
He also announced a more personal enhancement of security forces, namely "in a mid-fourth dimensional order over a few years".
Sympathy for terrorism must be sentenced again.
Video monitoring is intended to improve the weapons law so newly, especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet.
The last lot of debated illness for doctors is to keep up according to the Maizi√®re's words.
However, he wants to find solutions in the dialogue with the doctors, how to reduce the risk of the citizens, said with regard to psychological accidents.
In order to enhance the radialization of refugees, the Minister is a better social care for it.
Learning forces should be better prepared for the treatment of traumated people.
For the persecution of crimes in specific areas of the Internet (Durknet), the Maizi√®re places the use of concealed investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that is involved in increasing security."
It is important that the Minister of Internal Affairs have expressed a clear opposition against actionism.
"This was an earnest for the sharpmakers in the CDO/CSU," Gabriel said the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Freeday).
The Maizi√®re had previously rejected the call from the Union after a Burka prohibition and the abrogation of the double nationality.
A general prohibition of full-release was a problem for constitutional law.
You can't forget everything you're rejecting, and I'll reprove the tragedy of the Burka.
Regarding the rules in the road transport or for the witnesses, they may be sentenced to the court.
The Green Chief Simone Peter proposed the Minister to simulate the effective power and activity of new anti-terrorism packages.
Left party Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotte Spruchs and a strengthening of the residence rights do not bring people to security in this country."
Improved transport flow on the train bridge
It is regularly on the environmental strategy - this is a picture of November.
However, this is to be changed: the law enforcement should be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers that are located on the circle road every night when they walk through the cars to bringer (A 43).
The country's construction of road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Weseler Street, the law providers around 700 metres.
The car drivers can shoot right from the Hammer Street.
The great advantage: the transport is more prematurely, which improves the total end of the overall section of the Federal Strategic Strategy 51.
The idea with the extended exit was the CDF in the district of M√ºnster West.
Railway shipping on the trainer is mainly nervous between 17 and 19.00 p.m.
Workdays the back to the bridge over the alberslope and sometimes out there.
It is reasonable for the Nade resort on the B 51 short before the Weseler Street.
From here the transport will only be flown through the car bridges.
The second scene had to be rebuilt for a good quarter years.
The reason: Statistical calculations have shown that the bridges have no longer the necessary transit power to cover, in particular the loading.
As long as this engpass is delayed and the related working stage may not be said to the competent country office.
However, with years, it is to be counted: because the bridge has an official residue period up to 2034.
For the prorogation of law enforcement, the country business has consciously requested the deficiency of time in the schools because it was to be acknowledged with disabilities.
The transport shall be carried out on Thursday and Wednesday to the building.
Intercultural travels: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the theatre "The invisible house".
The United Nima's and the boy theatre are planning a music project now.
The Nima's Convention allows youths to visit the Migration and Refugee Fund to visit cultural institutions in M√ºnster.
The "Class International" of the Children's Children's School has visited a view of the priced "The invisible house" of the boy Theater Munster.
In the context of the "intercultural travel" initiated by the Nima, 19 students visited the incentive in the small house between 11 and 15 years.
Since the beginning of the year, the Agreement offers the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee interface to visit schools with welcome classes in the context of this project cultural institutions in monetary.
The majority of the classs came from September 2015 to March 2016 from Afghan, Iran, Serbia and Syria to monsters.
Thanks to the choreographics, the scene images and video animations could have been possible to follow the event of conduct, so the press communication of the boy Theaters M√ºnster.
The Nima's Unit, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the young theatre will work in the next game period in the context of a music theater project.
From October to December, youths have to receive the possibility of visiting professionally dedicated courses in the fields of sing, dance, shock and music between 14 and 20 years of age.
Provisions for children and families in the area of the theatre game and theatrale communication are in the planning.
The "intercultural travel" project continues.
In view of the increased refugee numbers, the agreement with many classes that want to participate is calculated.
Sleeves instead of stars: hope of weather detection
The weather has made the star shoes in the south-west of Germany a strike on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The night was badly able to observe the sky spectacle because of rain and rain, said the Chairman of the Starwarte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather should be good, then we will see many stars on the sky.
The star shoes are Persedies which belong to the fastest star shoes with 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come out of the star image Perseus that appears in the Northern.
Small night: Tips against sleep disorders
When the night comes forever, the night wakes for a midst, the morning is far before the shopping knight is not to think about sleeping.
It's all different than recurring.
There is always such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a fourth of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent of their sleep is often or permanently recognised.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders feel?
There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there can be a variety of causes based on them, highlights Hans-Guide Weece, member of the German Society for sleeping and sleeping medicine.
What you understand, but the insomnia is, therefore, an insomnia and sleep disruption.
While the sleeping is not satisfied or inadequate, Jens Wagen knock says, a member of the German household association with practice in the Netherlands.
What's going on behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
In this case, organic, psychological or conductive factors may also be covered by medicine.
Not rare is sleeping expression of another disease.
"True early wave is especially often at a depression," Weesch says.
And it may be that different factors are wearing each other.
For instance, the person who has a band's precaution can fall badly wait for all two-third hours and begins to swallow every day problems and -speak, wee√ü gives an example.
This leads to adjustment, and sleep is not possible.
When should you have sleep disorders to your doctor?
Whoever not sleeps well over a month in at least three nights per week and has been affected on the day should go to the doctor.
Infringement can look very different: it is cut, laughed, unsounded, has difficulties with attention and concentration, it is easy to smile, has stimulation or physical complaints such as magic or head pain.
It is important to find out the causes of sleeping.
The treatment options, among other behavioral changes, a cognitive behavior treatment or even medically - classic sleep tablets are questioned only in exceptional cases and at least for two weeks.
In Germany, there are little sleep medicines that are understood by Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine centre of the Charity University Medicine Berlin.
It is why we should first go to the home physician when sleeping problems.
It can explain with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should be in the bed laboratory, and what's going on?
For investigation in the bed laboratory, for example, in snacks with athemaus seeds, in hospitality, in sleeping channels, or if you don't find the cause of sleep disorders, Fietze.
Preparing for the investigation must not be done.
You should get the day normal.
"No, please don't sleep at midnight," Fietze says.
After the castle, you're going to bed at his normal time.
Besides the electrics in the body, you're taking a nase brill, a brown and a leg on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the board shows the sleeping.
How can the interested people get the problems in the griff?
There are a lot of stems in which you can be able to make a better sleep.
It includes: Regular sleeping and relief times, not being too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not seeing close to sleep, meditate alcohol and night not looking at the hour - then you start to receive immediately, and that's all and not promoting.
What is the dschungel camp with missing medailles in the skin
The former German summer Markus Debiler has expressed himself in Facebook for the deceived declination of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had helped the short-term rail media in Doha for the first time and set up his first world record at the same time.
Now the former DSV atlet Markus Deabler was protected by Facebook before his former teams in the criticism.
"In a country where a olympiaceacher has a premium of $20,000, and a king of 150,000‚Ç¨ should be wonderful about missing medailles," the 26-year-old boys on his Facebook page wrote on Friday.
The promotion system in the swimming sport is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
In this way, we cannot competite with countries that promote very much and doping is not so exact or even acting.
"I don't say that the controls should be set here," he continued.
If he starts a competitive back, Debiler must be reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is how we should keep it with countries.
"If a certain time before WM/OS may not be controlled by independent WADA/FINA controllers, the election-Hamburger may not be participated", requests the election-Hamburger, who is in the midst of a iron summer.
Airport: bands of bags
Professional Diebe at the airport D√ºsseldorf
On Thursday, two women and two men in the age of 50 to 61 years of age were civil servants of the D√ºsseldorfer police.
The defenders had started as a band of several bags and bags.
At 21.30 p.m. civilian officers re-established a band known by the police from past slaughter crimes.
The two women and two men have started a number of crimes since the mid- July this year, and there was a community, working and specially professional.
The criminal committee's specialists 34 may prove four acts of acts that have been invoked to Germany.
They were totally encouraged by EUR 15,000.
Altbauers, a few lind trees, between the rest of a stone floor: the Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not act on the first sight, but the police is part of the "the dangerous places" of the city.
When you go from the east to the west, you're coming to play places, a fried child garden and a biolade.
At the fassade of a green house, someone's presumed "high!".
On the other hand, a member who will also be deleted will be built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new accommodations will be placed.
Articles on this "treated city part", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are, however, qualified in the last few weeks with brushing cars.
This is why the house was set out in paragraph 94: first it was placed, mostly the people who lived in the homes have been placed in the earthquake, and they are used for events.
In particular, the Berlin inner Senator Henkel has spoken several times since the beginning of the year for a hard step in the police against the project, named "No-Go-Zone" for police police and 94 as an autonome start point of violence.
After 22 June the rooms in the earthquake, the chairmanships were shocked with 300 police officers, the police patroled officials for three weeks with 30 to 40 employees and three cars on the ground, slowed parts of the road and took visitors to enter the house with number 94.
During the time, renewed construction workers as part of the unknown homeowner are the rooms.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the residence was illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers went to the Jubel of Sympathists and inhabitants.
On this summer Sunday, the street is peaceful: parents go to space with children, people sit on the citizen shift before the houses in the sun, others maintain a spoil shape.
In the immediate proximity of the house projects, a basic school and child farms are found.
Left violence is not the main concerns of many inhabitants: Kerstin Newbauers who have been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who are here larger, are mostly generated by the police responsibilities.
They share the concern for increased wages and genitalization with the inhabitants of the household projects.
It doesn't seem to be a kies, which mostly wished to be the police protection before the slaughtering links.
The crown that the Berlin Innersector and the police between householders and their neighbors are obviously not present.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was a traditional workshop, which also has a lower average income and high poverty risk today in comparison with the rest of the city.
The housestocks and the household projects that were born are long to Kiez: 1990 have been placed many houses in the former DDR, including the whole mainway near the Rigaer.
While the owners were slaughtered under a rule slaughter, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are still inhabited today by people who had been placed 26 years ago.
At the same time, the city's part in the past years has become increasing to the magnets for tourists and electionberliners from all the world: now the inhabitants of DDR and the former householders are shared in their Kiez.
This is also noted in the reliefs that have been increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.
Many of the rebuildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognised by coated shoes or fresh strikes that were covered with color shoes.
No other streets were mentioned this year so often with the words "links autonomy violence".
A reason why not all neighbors consider it as a problem could be that they are not inevitably affected by criminality: Criminal crimes such as corporate infringement are almost exclusively against police.
The largest part of the crimes depends on the damages that tenderly meet the reconstruction and fresh renewed houses.
For Kerstin new constructioners who have been living in a measuring house for 17 years next to the surrounded 94 can not be a speaking of insecurity.
As regards violence, the people in 94 are their neighbors who have not been determined.
Also, the famous slaughter cars have no longer made it directly in the Rigar.
For the studied architects, it is not a criminal burning point, instead: "Here you can help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than any other."
New constructioner has been cut into the Rigaer Street - and remained.
This was why she was so important that the people returned to their road: from the police, the policy and the media, which recently claimed all the Germanity over the city's part in July.
But in the eyes of residents as new buildings, the street is continued to be removed: by sightless rebuilding in former buildings that disappear the old inhabitants.
"These are final property accommodations that are not interesting for many here - more people living here that are not so well", they say.
"Government and destruction can't be good."
But what should you do if someone never listens to?
It's going to put on all sides, even at the police and the people.
For additives that are hungry over color bombs, Kerstin Newbauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scenes belonged to Kiez.
This should be aware of it - just like someone who's in a swimming snake can smell over the laugh.

Urbach: Anniika Godchle is a new refugee deputy
Annika Godchle is the partner in matters of integration and organization.
In addition, she is a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Godchle is the Refugee Officer for Urbach.
The Socialp√§dagogin supports the management team of Achim Grockenberger.
It looks as a partner for all actors: refugees, working circle refugee assistance, administration, authorities and others.
Regine Customers of the working circle states that the honor officials are more than thankable that God's cloud is now there, the sweet milk milk, which is especially a problem.
Thus, some -- less slowly than the number of task areas that were expected -- were commonly used when the administration wanted to describe the office.
An administrative power has been requested with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-year experience in the field of social work, as well as a pleasant milk.
But administrative work is not her central area, I mean Annika Godchle.
In particular, it is about organization, work with people in place and behind the cultures and network activities.
The 31-year-old boy has been around six weeks.
She has spent a 50 per cent steel for three years.
"It was the highest time," Regine Customer says that Annika Godchles supported honor and primary actors.
There are major and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Shortly new containers are in the wash road
There is a serious problem since some time to find apartments for the refugees who have been recognized.
The communities are responsible for the connection submission.
They need to enter the refugees in their own or accommodated living rooms.
The costs for the construction, the currency or the renewal of these accommodations must take the communities itself.
The responsibility changes from the Country Council to communities and job centres.
Problem: There are free objects, but not everyone wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult since some time.
In fact, the management does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work until now, if you are appointed to private housing, so God‚Äôs clergy.
Therefore, common apartments should be obtained, as it is so beautiful.
So soon new containers will be placed in the wash road.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the sign, the Regine clients and Annika Godchle are united.
Besides a fixed stay, there are practical places, training, school places, euro works and help activities for refugees and migrants who must be found or established.
"More plans would be good," says Regine Client.
Many work in the building court or help householders, finishing common work - and it is motivated and very ordinary as Annika Godchle reports.
She hopes that the work for the Commonwealth leads to a positive external impact.
That's "no job therapy".
But the activity does not mean only work.
The day needs a fixed structure, say Godchles and customers.
People should develop a sense of identity.
So you need offers such as sports, contacts with local and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rar.
Thus, they also enter the administration and the honor officials here.
It is central that the refugees have the feeling that they wished and welcomed in Germany.
The long time of the procedure is a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it is the same time and they can fully overcome the time, for example, with speech courses.
Whoever ever develops the feelings, he cannot help anyone in the city, should not work and be inutile, he will never be integrated.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, say honestly, "Leaves where there is nothing." The work of God's clergy and customers should therefore always motivate others.
That's all a "Mammud motion."
A difficult question: Do the two are fearing of radicalization in a small community such as urban?
"No," Regine Customer says very clearly, "what some can call naive." A restriction can be made, and it doesn't want to exclude.
The helper's being sensitive.
These events were also the subject of refugees.
They were afraid that the murders were completely inquiring them.
"You want to show that they have nothing to do", says Regine Client.
Many would like to stay in the city.
The main and honor officials must therefore be viewed according to activities in the region.
They always have a new stage of refugees and migrants to urbans in the background.
Does Germany need an overwhelming level?
The policy is to answer this question clearly.
Indeed, it is unfair to help them in place.
"In the city, we're not here where we want," says Annika Godchle.
No new refugees, this would relax the situation.
Regine Customs also clearly shows that the urbans have already been loaded to integrate consciously the people at present.
These are now about 100 people, over youth men.
But if people are in need, they should help them, both women are agreed.
The political situation is so complex, there is no simple answers.
